Closure of the sitting
Thank you for that.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.

President of the Commission. - Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis.
The conclusions of the report which was debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament reveal to us that the import of agricultural products from third countries has much more adverse environmental impacts than Community production, subject to much stricter provisions on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, thus contributing to climate change.
Indeed, it is difficult to accept that the countries to which these funds are granted are unable to use them.
Dates for next sittings: see Minutes
Maritime transport institutions in the Member States need to work much more closely together to harmonise their training programmes and offer opportunities for paid trainees and exchanges of experience with European maritime carriers.
The next item is the Commission statement on the impact of storm Xynthia on Europe.
What strikes us is that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers.
Frontex must be strengthened and the authorities of the Member States must also be made mandatory by the EU.
I would like to add one point which has not yet been raised apart from Commissioner Almunia.
Water resources, agriculture, energy, forestry and biodiversity, and, last but not least, the health of the population, are particularly exposed to the effects of climate change.
Let me also express my personal concern and the Commission's concern over the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a police officer in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks.
Mr Piebalgs, congratulations on all your work.
It is reassuring, however, that the Committee on Budgets, as a result of the resistance and alarm expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education in view of the downgrading of the education and training policies, particularly at a time when unemployment is increasing and causing problems in numerous Member States of the European Union, has presented the necessary amendments that I endorsed and which initially proposed (for example, in the case of Article 1502).
Then a minority government with completely different political convictions took power, but no one called it a coup.
The fact that we, as the international community, looked at the Abyeia question at the referendum is highly irresponsible and a recipe for a new war in the future.
The case of Romania's mobile phone player, Marian Cozma, who was brutally murdered by two members of the Roma community, shows us once again that crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive.
We must have a stable food policy in the EU.
The Treaty of Lisbon should be a new policy model in Europe, both from the point of view of the need to pool the resources of the Member States in order to achieve optimum results, and from the work on common policies and missions that make Europe also make the political union from which its founding fathers drew years ago.
That is our concern.
All of us, and Hungary, too, was in favour of the internal market from the outset.
The inevitable climate change is forcing society and the European Union's economy to adapt to a new reality.
Individual states will continue to promote internal stability and help find both socio-economic solutions and ethnic tensions solutions.
We have really spent three excellent years together, but as all fine things have to end this episode.
There is an absolute need for NATO to remain vigilant and for it to be supported, particularly in Afghanistan.
However, something needs to be done and we need to get things moving.
In this respect, it is important to address common aspects, such as the reduced VAT rate, the tax exemption, the option of setting a maximum tax and, last but not least, the place of taxation of intra-EU goods.
Let me give you some information about the West Midlands: we are suffering the highest youth unemployment rate, and our car industry has been greatly weakened, partly by the jobs in Slovakia funded by the European Union, which cost us important jobs at the Ryton plant.
It is essential that these young institutions are not encouraged to weaken or undermine the main rules for reforming the financial sector.
That has to stop.
We should also make it easier to set up a network of research centres that can share specific infrastructure and exchange useful information and data.
Qimonda is in line with the Lisbon Strategy objectives.
in writing. - Mr President, I very much welcome the idea of setting up a European Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries, particularly Africa and the Middle East, is deteriorating.
Mr Severin has rightly pointed out strategic reciprocity and declared that Europe needs a strong America and the US, conversely, needs a strong Europe.
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what impact these flows will have in terms of the proportion that can be included in the resettlement programme.
I firmly believe that in the near future, the Canadian authorities will make every effort to pass on these visas.
Finally, it was not a food inspector, nor was it an EU agency for food safety that has hit the company itself.
Belarus (debate)
That is why we should use our ideas of military capabilities to focus on soft power and prevention in order to tackle a new agenda that has become apparent in Munich, but which was actually the case before, because with President Obama's policy, it will be possible for us to enter a new era of disarmament negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which has been ready for some time in the Committee on Budgets.
In September, the Mouvement Democrate party members did not vote in favour of the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission, because his record of success was not in favour of re-election.
When reforming agricultural policy, we can ensure that poor livestock farming is promoted, that animals are granted biological conditions which are poor and that we conduct animal husbandry with red animals, according to the slogan'prevention is better than cure'.
We are now concerned that, when this directive is expanded, when its scope is extended, it will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce'Made in' origin marking, so it is blocked again in the Council.
(SL) Mr President, I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians, Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts in favour of economic recovery.
Countries such as Britain and the United States of America, both with deficits of 10%, will have to undergo a substantial balance in order to restore the sustainability of their public finances.
We should separate matters, otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new Hungarian media law, and I do not think it is his responsibility.
There is also clearly too little opportunity in China for freedom of expression.
- Report: Cavada
This would not only be an insult to the wine producers who, particularly in the Provence, have opted for a policy of quality, but it would also be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product created from a mixture of final products and to allow an irreleading reference to ros√© colour.
However, there is much more to be done.
What will happen is that jobs in rural Europe will be lost and our capacity for food production will be reduced.
We would like to recall that, in spite of these institutional matters of the Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - there is, of course, a great deal of influence on the needs, necessary measures on climate change, the financial crisis, the concern in Europe that we need a policy for job creation; all important issues to be dealt with.
I would also like to stress that we know that many of the texts needed for the cooperation of the police and the judiciary need a new basis for Parliament to exercise its role as colegislator.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs on having excluded the ethical element, which, of course, falls within the competence of the Member States.
That is good, because ultimately, it is young people who decide the future of Europe, but we should also remember those who have already made their own significant contribution to building Europe.
This means that I am making an'Economic Recovery Plan', where I spend three and a half billion on the energy oligopolies and not a single euro on the partners that I need for the'green energy'.
Fishing quotas and fisheries management are essential in order to avoid total overfishing of inland waters and seas.
We would have liked Parliament's resources to have been increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency rather than by increasing the overall budget.
Furthermore, this package could show that the EU institutions can work together in such an important area in a responsible, efficient and constructive manner.
I believe that a front-loading approach, that is to say, improving first-instance procedures, as the Commission supports in its recast proposal, will enable us to make savings in the medium term.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have a good report on the table.
We do not want to dump European jobs into countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we have here.
All the contributions were useful.
(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is deteriorating significantly.
They need to work hard to reach an understanding between the 27 Member States in order to show the unity and will of Europe to overcome the crisis and respect the west of European integration.
Madam President, I speak as the Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report.
Tourism is, without doubt, one of the largest potential for development.
At that time, the money was earmarked for just two types of projects aimed at reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, namely carbon capture and storage and wind parks in the North Sea.
If we were to make the proposal to make money available from the EGF to workers made redundant, we would vote in favour and be criticised if we did not.
As far as the Court of Justice's activities are concerned, we know that the Court of Justice is fully operational, but is still at the beginning.
It concerns our neighbours and includes our next neighbours, such as Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, but also others, further away, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Together with my colleagues in the Commission, I am very committed to ensuring that the gender perspective is taken into account in all the policies we are going to put forward.
These projects will help to eliminate the differences in interconnections between the systems in the European Union and will make it possible for the European Union to use of its own energy sources more effectively.
Furthermore, this approach is based on politics and I believe that, more than anything, Europe needs more policies, and this is certainly one of the responsibilities of our Parliament.
Then we have the problem of the FIFA failing to introduce the Torlini technology, as is the case with other types of sports.
Finally, we are all able to organise various types of training and workshops, in which we can provide real assistance with regard to access to EU funds aimed at developing rural areas.
There are others who use the lack of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral agreements with suppliers, who often disregard the needs of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity.
I also welcome the fact that in the area of legislative programming, Parliament and the Commission have succeeded in establishing a closer school flow.
In particular, many Member States have made considerable efforts to fulfil their obligations on the pact.
They are supposed to make it possible for the EU to respond to the major challenges of society (demographic ageing and health, energy, water and food supply, sustainable development, tackling climate change, etc.), which affect all Member States and which they alone cannot respond to and develop the knowledge with which to make our businesses more innovative and increase their competitiveness.
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow, I think there are some discrepancies in this budget, and I would like to highlight two of them that I think are the most important.
Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his excellent work.
We will continue with government issues for the global economy, particularly financial regulation and timely follow-up of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.
I would, however, like to look at this matter somewhat more closely.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to support you in their efforts to reintegrate into the labour market.
The underlying problem is the desire of Europeans to no longer have to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment, which inevitably ends with accession.
This is an intimate, difficult role.
That is high on our list of priorities.
However, EU support is essential to ensure the country's independence.
The Israeli Government is continuing its colonies through a forcible expansion, and this has been after conducting war crimes at the beginning of this year.
The evaluations and additional visits from the expert groups have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready for full participation in the Schengen area.
Adjournment of the session
Portugal is still the five longer-term fish, just as it was before.
The increase in the budget in these areas and the creation of new military capacities, contributing to a new weather burden.
I would also like to highlight the contradiction between the commitment of the Pakistani Government to freedom of religion and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic states to support the agenda'fight against the defamation of religion' in the United Nations.
I say this here this afternoon because that is my honest opinion.
As it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment, I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good compromise.
Under these circumstances, rapid, coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is an absolute must, such as the introduction of programmes for issuing older cars against a corresponding reduction in the purchase price of a new car, financial support, etc.
In my view, the proposed legal basis is right, but it does not appear to have very broad agreement with what is more than a significant entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon when the tasks and powers that are currently shared between the two pillars are consolidated.
Madam President, success or failure is the question here.
Such a policy must fail if people working in the fishing industry, from fishermen to retailers who sell fish to consumers, do not comply with the rules.
These costly, useless padronia club, which Parliament calls itself and represents an incumbent illusion of a responsible democracy, which is an outrageous fraud against the voters who have elected us.
That is regrettable, because it seems to me that we should be united on this issue.
We no longer claim that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will kill 100% of our industries in Europe, where we do not care about this, because the climate issue must take priority.
A debt burden - and we are seeing painful proof of this - is in the way of economic growth not only in our European countries, but also in the United States.
Furthermore, this report will help clarify the various air agreements and will carry them out in the simplest way, and it sets out what criteria we should devote attention to and what aspects we should bear in mind.
I will vote in favour of the telecommunications package, but I am somewhat hesitant because I believe that there has been a basic high-level betrayal Council, namely the basic principles of the liberalisation of telecommunications that this directive should implement.
(PT) Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, we are in a crisis that has never been there before.
They will have a greater influence and a burden of costs on the taxpayer if we are able to coordinate our efforts.
The European Commission is concerned with drawing up a directive which will make it easier for Belarusians to obtain EU visas and also a readmission agreement.
Let me give you a concrete example, which is perhaps a little chauvinist, but be it print.
Let us take a look, for example, at child education and schools.
In addition, we do not yet know whether the standards we have proclaimed for legal timber trade in the world will enter into force and apply - some speakers have already referred to this problem.
The creation of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a means of analysing and assessing the measures taken by Member States to support sustainable growth is of the utmost importance.
in writing. - I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to make it possible to use of vaccines more efficiently and reduce bureaucracy for farmers.
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for the creation of a strong, integrated EU policy.
By abstaining, I would like to express my profound disappointment with the outcome of the summit, which was well below the expectations of our citizens.
Late payment constantly causes difficulties in internal markets and in cross-border trade.
Of course, we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and discipline that does not dispute, but we should not insist that the citizens should take all efforts because they are our only chance to gain the upper hand of this crisis.
There is an early warning system about this in the United States.
One of these cases concerns one of my own constituents, Andrew Symeou.
We must defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy together.
You are joicing things: that is why you asked the people of Europe in their election to this Parliament, and that is what we have to give them in only five years' time if we want them to go more numerous ballot boxes.
The text passports for which the European Council is responsible have been discussed and agreed by the European Council itself.
Private consumer expenditure per capita wave has been exceeding 80% over the last decade.
At the moment, I believe that it would be useful to think carefully about suitable ways to strengthen current legislation.
The summit conclusions are very vague in this respect.
To this end, the proposal offers uniform instruments that provide enforcement or safeguards in order to avoid problems in the recognition and translation of instruments originating from other Member States and a standard formula for the provision of documents regarding demands on the territory of another Member State.
I support the present proposals for the 2011 budget because the important policy areas are taken into account and the individual opinions are taken into account.
The Commission can help Member States to cooperate at European level through financing programmes.
For example, the Council conclusions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 gave Member States the power to cooperate at national level, intergovernmental level, in order to prosecute these crimes, which is, fortunately, even set out in the legislation in some Member States - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet.
Thank you very much.
My vote should not be seen as consent to the EU's subsidising subsidies either.
Our purchases are increasingly made up of distance, and the Internet has now changed our habits completely, even because our way of life is getting tougher and more.
As far as information is concerned, we continually make it available as soon as we have it.
In conclusion, the best investment is investment in the education of our young generation, by which I mean lifelong education.
We do not actually want a death penalty anywhere.
I am very pleased that these points have been resolved satisfactorily in the final agreement with the Council.
(Uproar from the centre left)
In this case, thousands of people are affected, often with small children and without sufficient resources.
Procedures are completely different in terms of the Commission's recruitment in accordance with the provisions of the future Treaty and Parliament's application of the petitions process.
Human rights must be respected by all parties in the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has raised the question of whether we can maintain the stability of the euro area.
We all have to face our responsibilities.
We assume that UNESCO has, in any case, become stunned by the Chinese Government due to the impact of development on traditional heritage and culture.
in writing. - MEP Schwab has tabled a report which aims to increase vehicle safety by introducing stricter requirements for car manufacturers' safety.
I therefore voted against the report.
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard, but we have shown that we are able to act and we are more resistant than before.
If we are talking about Parliament's position externally, for example with human rights organisations, which could be extremely affected and if we cannot come to an agreement - which I hope will not - and then individual projects cannot be implemented, then I would like to see approval and understanding of Parliament's position.
This Thursday afternoon, the meetings in this Parliament are taking an increasingly surreal turn, both in terms of the empty we can see and in terms of the issues that have been raised and in terms of the way they are addressed.
I think that it is still completely unclear whether Moldova will be able to elect its President, and if this does not happen, it will certainly hold new elections next year.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999.
(EL) Madam President, I too should like to endorse the current compromise and congratulate it on raising the issue of democratic deficits that women have been facing for years in particular, when they help their self-employed men trade, craft, small and medium-sized enterprises and the free professions without acknowledging their work done over the years.
Of course, our political elections are evidently different and sometimes generate.
I would refer to climate justice, because it is about the relationship between industrialised and developing countries and the will to present a credible proposal for financing, both for mitigation and for adaptation, and for the way in which we are showing our willingness to move forward.
I would therefore also like to know what position the Commission takes on this issue.
I would like to remind you here of State aid for the banks, which, as it were, benefit from this, but which did not act appropriately from the social point of view.
I have not only three children, but also a recipe that currently only rocks milk.
We are prepared to draw up technical assistance programmes which will complement the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities must take.
We are currently waiting for the strategy to be drawn up by the Commission.
As you have said, we need to constantly update our statistics and that is what Eurostat is about.
Sometimes, I wonder whether we have not sufficiently learned the lessons regarding the impact of our policies if we do not follow European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific, even though we have to deal with them as a whole.
E-mails also reveal that scientists who are sceptical about the fact that specialist audit procedures have been kept to the point of view in order to prevent scientific shortcomings from occurring to the public.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate.
The Internet has perhaps shed light on this very dark part of our society, which we are still having to deal with, a difficult undertaking.
We know his gay and this must then be clear in the case of controls, in the institutions, that they are more at risk and, therefore, have to be subject to stricter controls.
Our primary aim in the review of the RoHS Directive was to increase safety standards for electrical equipment and electronic gadgets located in the European Union.
Prevention is primarily carried out in schools, as this social group is regarded as particularly vulnerable to drug addiction.
It has been successfully expanded to bring the continent back after the end of the Cold War, and now it is called on to maintain what has been achieved to date and to continue integration as soon as times get better.
Many Members would like their questions to be answered this evening and, out of consideration, we would like to do this Question Time properly.
But those of us who were affected by it knew that there was no alternative to the problems of dairy farming having to be solved and we are now, I hope, on the way to resolve some of the problems that this sector is facing.
Secondly, while the ECR Group fully endorses the need for maternity and paternity legislation, we have chosen to abstain on such references in this report as we reject any family policy prescribed at EU level; the power of decision making on these issues rests solely with national governments.
Last but not least, I believe that the next discussions that we must have on this issue must address the issue, in what way this mission can be revived and how it might perhaps be extended.
So the Commission monitors the situation and will intervene, but in my opinion we should not go beyond the structures that exist in Community law and the Commission will certainly not exceed the limits of Community law.
As our common vision is to see a real, European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we will debate and vote on tomorrow are of the utmost importance.
in writing. - In the light of the existing gap between men and women in terms of employment levels, salaries and access to managerial positions, I call on Member States to make the transposition of Directive 2002/73/EC quicker, thereby ensuring that their provisions are transposed fully and effectively into national legislation.
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
I would like to be genuinely confirmed by the Commissioner that in the next few weeks, no further steps will be taken because these refugees will first have to be extradited.
We will address this issue soon, in the discussions on the recast of the first railway package and with the White Paper on the future of transport.
Today, on Wednesday, 20 October, the European Parliament adopted the report by its special committee on the financial, economic and social crisis.
We are already talking about tax increases in the near future to rehabilitate public finances.
Today is the time for us to express our demands for Christians and for the supporters of other religions in order to be able to practise their religion freely.
In the EU, 31.5% of women work part-time (30 hours or fewer per week) and only 8.3% of men.
I share the cautious optimism of the members of the Commission and the Minister, and I have the impression that the sky is investigating, although there are still many clouds.
At this time, only a few of us could have appreciated the extent of the upcoming economic crisis.
Parliament therefore moves in the right direction and shows that it is on the side of consumers.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank Mrs R√ºhle and the shadow rapporteurs for this very solid report.
This policy has become a key feature of the economic recovery package, which represents added value and supports efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth, at the same time demonstrating European solidarity.
So it is unfortunate that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force and we clearly need to put it into force without further delay.
However, I think that the situation shows very clearly what the plight of agriculture is - in any case my region - when farmers have to endure for days during the winter months to secure modest sums of EU funds.
The Member States of southern Europe have been waiting too long for this to happen.
To this end, we need balanced, sustainable and integrated growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.
On behalf of our citizens, we express our will in a democratic vote, and therefore tomorrow is an extremely important day.
It has to be said that providing housing is an absolute necessity for everyone, especially in a modern welfare state.
The definition of priorities is, in my view, a political tool that should be closely examined, transparent and democratic.
This particular project concerns the use of the transport management system.
(HU) In recent months, Vojvodina in North Serbia has once again witnessed a climate of fear among the various nationalities living there, mainly Hungary.
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes difficult - and I am aware that what Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved on our behalf is a realistic and achievable result.
in writing. - Whilst we support those parts of the proposal that provide for equal treatment for Parliament and the Council in terms of access to meetings and information, as well as regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament; cooperation on citizens' initiative; impact assessments of legislation; and the application of non-compulsory legislative instruments ('soft law'); however, instead of penalising the law?
As we all know, there can be no broadcasting without access to radio spectrum, and EU policy aims to ensure that all market players have non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum.
This will form a general and quite comprehensive framework for action for the Commission in relation to progress in the areas of equality between men and women, which my fellow Member has just mentioned: working balance with all the other ways in which such equality must be ensured and ensured.
We look forward to the other political and economic heavyweighs submitting their offers, which has not happened so far with some of them.
Dementia, and Alzheimer's in particular, is not only a serious medical problem, but also a very sensitive ethical and social problem, the significance of which will become ever greater in terms of ageing the population of Europe.
I would also like to say that you have put great diligence into your emphasis on the fact that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I would also certainly not like to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union.
rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs who have dealt with this issue in detail: Mr Sz√°jer, Mr Duff, Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl.
We have provided them with our hand and ask Minsk, with the full support of all the European institutions, to take them, because the government and the people of Belarus have much to gain.
We need to monitor what is happening, because the President said that we would have expected annual savings of EUR 38 billion for European businesses.
And now, after the ruling against Liu Xiaobo, we even have to see that a homosexuality party has been banned by the police, that it is obvious that there is a political space for dissidents, human rights activists and homosexuals in China.
(SL) Commissioner, you have made it very clear in your report on Ukraine today.
It should be acknowledged that this only goes when the parliaments are involved in this - because only through the parliaments can a large part of the regulations be adjusted appropriately - and that this process and the proposals relating to the Transatlantic Legislator'Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are very important.
Someone has spoken about Helicopters.
Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to see you and to hear you here.
I wanted to underline that in this agreement.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to those women who cooperate in their self-employed spouses.
Anyone who was in Gaza after the conflict can confirm the enormous suffering of the people.
(ES) Madam President, the relationship with the United States is strategically speaking, the most important relationship for the European Union.
I have to say that our ambition is to reach an agreement by the June European Council meeting.
However, we all know that Europe can no longer afford with less money.
At the same time, the large number of participants at the Copenhagen conference fills me with the hope that action such a large number of partners will ultimately have a chance of success.
Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of supporting the motion for there to be no resolution, because I have heard Mr Schulz say something which is very important in my view: if we really want this debate to include'Europe' and not just Italy, then it makes no sense to vote on a resolution entitled'Freedom of Information in Italy'.
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report.
This recommendation by Parliament envisages the adoption of the Council regulation and also to avoid further delay, as the new regulation would simplify the management of procedures and ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals legally residing in the Union in the area of social security.
This is a rather shocking figure, and it is a figure I mentioned in a report that I worked out during the previous parliamentary term of this Parliament.
But perhaps an EU policy for the Arctic is not as bizarre as the appointment of absolutely unqualified Baroness Ashton, Sarah Palin on the ex-collar left, as High Representative.
It is simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union and must be regarded as a benchmark for future bilateral trade agreements.
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that it is a reduction in necessities, and their stand represents a bad starting point for negotiations.
As far as the car industry is concerned, I believe that we have attached too little importance to the development of completely new types of vehicle, cars driven by hydrogen, active and fuel cells.
We will then go separately.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union.
The European Union, as a partner of Thailand, is ready to support the country in its capacity during this complicated process.
In order to ensure that this derogation, which is intended to make it possible to create jobs and prosperity, is also of real benefit to local populations, and does not harm European industries, which process fishery products and relocate into doses, it was, in fact, essential to assess their consequences as quickly as possible and, where necessary, to suspend them.
This is precisely what the Commission and the Council are doing at the moment in a very commendable way to ensure the reopening of gas supplies as soon as possible; obviously, taking legal steps is not a particularly effective approach.
Member States must immediately investigate these serious human rights violations against Roma women, punish the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are investigated and compensated.
(LT) Mr President, however, we are dealing with a complex issue here.
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national regulators, but also - and has not yet been mentioned - to the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with the Committee on European Affairs, the Committee on Budgetary and Budgetary Control.
My proposal to you would be for you to ensure that now that the European External Action Service sets out its rules for accessing information and documents, it becomes a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens and which does not treat foreign policy as if it were the remit of some flagship diplomats.
All countries are currently changing their economic policies with the aim of bringing the unfavourable economic situation to fruition as soon as possible and at least achieving a degree of economic growth.
Let me also say something about the Japanese people.
Mr Barroso opposed the fact that this was an internal matter.
We are therefore among those who believe that Schengen should not be weakened but rather maintained and strengthened.
It is no secret that the origin of our European identity is directly distanced from the Christian tradition.
They make sense for large companies, but they bring public transport together and are responsible for the worsening state of the network and safety.
On the other hand, the discussion on Turkey's future membership of the EU cannot be disregarded.
The risk must be brought under control effectively and, as the tragic events in Japan reminds us, this is an urgent matter.
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure better protection for workers against the risk of vulnerability by all sharp or sharp circumstances used in medicine.
In short, I am probably finalising this report this evening, but the work is far from complete, not for me and not for the European institutions.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work, and I would like to stress that my group was very cautious from the outset with regard to the many implications in terms of data protection as regards the adoption of SIS II.
There must be proper conditions.
In 2009, the Ombudsman received a total of 3 098 complaints in comparison with 3 406 in 2008, which represents a 9% drop.

Most contributors stress the need to focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture, the capacity to respond to climate change, food safety and quality requirements, and other environmental targets.

Then we will also be able to make a big contribution from Europe, but this hatred must have a ground.

The main progress of this directive in relation to existing legislation is that patients will be able to choose their health service providers and that they will have access to information on the quality and safety of services they receive.

Citizens' participation in social cohesion or solidarity between generations is not recognised.
However, the real reform is admissibility.
This is one of the most important human rights problems in the European Union today.
For this purpose, appropriate financial resources must be made available, using the possibilities to exploit new sources for global competitiveness.
In many countries of Europe, when they find themselves in a difficult situation, public authorities generally pay late, and very often this leads to the bankruptcy of companies.
The G20 also made the reduction of tax havens one of the main concerns.
There is no such response from the political class.

It is important that we have made some progress along these lines with Mr Vlas√°k's report, which I fully support, and I think that this report will enable us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes, which are capable of giving new quality to cohesion policy.

Every 25 years, a reactor crash happens.

Today is the time to speak again about the violation of religious rights in these two countries, and this time we are talking about Christians.
Climate change, one of the greatest threats to our planet.
Of course, the focus, as expected, on human rights - the importance of ensuring that this is clearly part of all the dynamic relations that we have and that our work encompasses.
I must also say that the European Union has had no legal competence whatsoever to regulate air traffic.
However, Europe is not a bet or barraft for an economic crisis.
So I can confirm to the rapporteur the Commission the commitment already made to comitology and optional provisions.
I do not believe that one of the warmest words we have expressed here today cannot change the words of the Commission, which is that the European Union is not present in Libya and that it is not even able to resolve the crisis situation in the cities or put a stop to Gaddafi's land troops.
I am therefore convinced that, if the European Parliament agrees with these two regulations, it will bring great benefits to EU citizens, because they will then have much greater choice.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I share the hope that the measures will be accepted at the European Council meeting to give new confidence to the markets and to reintroduce stability within the euro area, since, be it or not, we should all have an interest in it.

In this regard, it is particularly important to support efforts aimed at increasing EU investment in the following areas: diversification of cross-border structures, incentives to generate alternative, unconventional forms of energy at local level and improvements in infrastructure to facilitate the integration of new energy sources.
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market, thus leading to growth in internal demand and economic activity.
Secondly, we should consider implementing a rapid response instrument within the framework of the ENP in order to respond immediately and flexibly to political changes in the partner countries, as has happened recently in the southern neighbourhood.

The EU budget, unlike some MEPs' reasoning, cannot be used to increase national budgets in times of austerity, but should reflect the difficult situation in which the EU Member States find themselves.

(PL) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe, we are still fighting against their negative consequences.
In many areas, this is the case with Japan, but I acknowledge, for example, Japan's right to protect the national travel market and the transport industry, to pay higher prices than those applied to farmers in the world market and reject mass imports that would completely eradicate the farming population, just as I recognise the right of our economies to protect certain sectors of economic activity.
(ES) Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, that of coordination and that of flexibility.
For example, only 15% of the elderly use the Internet.
I am determined to give greater weight to the social priority in the context of this new strategy, as I told you in our debate on the general political guidelines for the next mandate.
I would therefore like to come straight to the point, Commissioner, and ask you what measures - and I am using the plural here - the Commission intends to take in the short term to address these shortcomings.
That is exactly what has been lacking or has not been made sufficiently visible for citizens.
That is not the interest of the citizens, and that is true.
(The sitting was closed at 00.10)

In September 2009, the Council launched a detailed investigation into the proposal to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund.
At this moment, it is important, in particular, to pay particular attention to peripheral regions and outermost regions, since in addition to their general difficulties, they are now faced with wasteful infrastructure and destructive personal, commercial property, and in many cases it will not be possible to restore normal operations quickly, particularly in areas that are dependent on tourism, as these media coverages could shut down.
Since 11 September 2001, we have not experienced such disruption of the industry with such major financial losses and this duration, and even if all Member States are facing financial difficulties, I urge them to provide financial support for a sector that simply does not cope with any more losses.
At the same time, we must admit that this also increases our risk exposure.
Madam President, I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because the situation in the Congo is disastrous.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to make a minor and perhaps also a semantiist comment.

That is what we have to do.
I really wonder, ladies and gentlemen, where the human rights defenders have stayed, who are, like us, pleased that the West is secular and pluralistic, and are gradually turning their glance away from the Middle East, a region open to just one faith.
This is being done and we are in contact with the authorities of these countries.
Mr President, bankers who are defamating our money are disgraceful, but Mr Schulz, politicians who today increase deficits and debt on the backs of the generations to come are no less irresponsible.
It has succeeded at first reading in producing the regulation on animal by-products by consensus, for which I would like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various political groups.
We believe that the Member States are now required to abide by what has been agreed.
Mr President, the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been good, and indeed very cooperative.
We should strive to ensure that the programmes offered are as supportive as possible of the reforms undertaken in these countries to bring them closer to the Union.

Previously, we interpreted all events in the Soviet Union against the backdrop of ideological pressure, and today we are negotiating in the conditions of absolute individual freedom.
Increased by the assessment of whether this is a private fund or a public fund, this report is about one very specific thing, namely that, firstly, Parliament notes that there is no legal right to sound deficits and, secondly, that we are not making deficit.
Certainly, it has to be the most expensive way since Helena, who left thousands of vessels out of steel.

Savings need transparent information which is well-understandable and available.
I think it could be a task for us to help the Chinese people achieve a harmonious society.

I am voting in favour of Mr Casini's report.
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution on the prohibition of pork and cattle thrombin.
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and to follow further investigations closely.

Yesterday's dialogue is hoping for a final agreement.
Forecasts based on an annual growth rate of 27% for the next few years indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015.
However, I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that the text can adopt the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision.
Many people ask me what ACTA is, and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for this anti-counterfeiting agreement.
I voted in favour of this report because this EU financial assistance will help the people who have fallen victim of globalisation find work and return to the labour market, and will help them escape from the grip of the recession.
As the Internet is the key instrument for creating better conditions, developing and knowledge of citizens in cultural terms, particularly through the spread of audiovisual content, I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and production of development and innovative software.
This brings together the general concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe and the concerns about the problems that would arise as a result of the accession of a country which shares its borders with more than 80 million inhabitants, factors that would increasingly strengthen my unflagrant view that Turkey's accession to the EU would not be the right thing, because, above all, unity is determined by Christianity.
Thank you, Mr President.
(Protests from the Chamber)
This means resisting environmental protection and consumer safety, because old, energy-efficient and potentially dangerous equipment would get back onto the market.

Secondly, the promotion of fundamental rights is one of the priorities of the Stockholm Programme which sets out the strategic guidelines for the development of an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe.
in writing. - (SV) We have also chosen this time to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to help 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and in the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering the consequences of the economic crisis and extraordinary times now require exceptional measures.
These studies should lead to a failure on the part of the Commission if its actions prove pointless, superfluous or costly.
The plan of the Arab League, the Saudi Arabia Peace Plan, provides for the renunciation of violence while respecting Israel's right to exist - what an ambitious and courageous plan!
The EU must work to ensure that the poorest countries receive, to a greater extent, effective assistance and debt alleviation where this is appropriate.
