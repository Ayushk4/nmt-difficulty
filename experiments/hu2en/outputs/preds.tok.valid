Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 summit in London will be a milestone for the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report that we are debating on Wednesday in the European Parliament point out that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much more harmful impact on the environment than on internal production , subject to stricter rules on CO2 emissions : that is , imports strengthen climate change .
This is all the more so because it is difficult to accept that the countries which receive these resources cannot use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime institutions of the Member States must cooperate much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes and to offer opportunities for missions and exchange experience with other European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What is certain is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
Frontex must be supported and the EU must force the Member States &apos; authorities to fulfil their obligations .
I would like to add one more point to what has been said , which Commissioner Almunia has not mentioned so far .
The effects of climate change are most sensitive areas : water resources , agriculture , energy sources , forests and biodiversity , and , last but not least , the health of the population .
I would also like to express my condolences , both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission , for the death of the nine Turkish soldiers and a Turkish Gendarmerie who died last week as a result of terrorist attacks .
Mr Piebalgs , congratulations on everything you do .
It is , however , reassuring that , as a result of the resistance shown by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and their concerns , which have been caused by an increase in education and vocational training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is growing , and this is causing problems in many European Union Member States , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I have personally supported and has increased ( for example , the plans for the 2002 ) programmes planned for the life programme to be drawn .
A minority government with completely different political convictions took power at that time , but no one has seen this as a coup d &apos;état .
The fact is that we , the international community , have succeeded in remaining unresolved in the case of Abyei in the referendum is , in fact , rather irresponsible and has the potential to renounce war .
Marian Cozma , a Romanian crabing case , who was killed cruelly by two members of the Roma community in Hungary , shows once again that crime knows no borders and that by turning a blind eye to the problems of the Roma community , we are achieving completely counterproductive results .
The European Union needs a strong food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon must represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of bringing together the resources of the Member States in order to achieve optimal results and in terms of who should develop common strategies and operations that will make Europe a dreamed political union for years .
That is what we are asking for .
We , Hungary , have all been in favour of the Single Market from the outset .
The inevitable climate change is forcing society and the economy of the European Union to adapt to a new reality .
Countries continue to promote internal security and help to find socio-economic solutions and to remedy ethnic tensions .
This was a great three-year monument ; like all short-term editorial history , I welcome the fact that it is coming to an end .
The need for NATO to continue to be vigilant about peace , and for this to happen , it is clear today , particularly in Afghanistan .
Something has to happen , however , and we have to get things right .
In this respect , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , exemption from the system , the possibility of setting the maximum threshold and , last but not least , the place for taxation of intra-EU product sales , must be examined .
Allow me to say a few things about the West : we have the highest youth unemployment rate and the automotive industry , partly because the European Union funded jobs in Slovakia , which have taken important jobs from the Ryton plant .
It is vital to ensure that these new institutions are not forced to weaken or undermine key rules for reform in the financial sector .
Enough is enough .
We must also create a network of research centres , which share a common infrastructure and share data and results .
Qimonda is in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the creation of a European Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries , particularly Africa and the Middle East , is continuing to deteriorate .
Mr Severin rightly stated that Europe needs a strong United States and that the US needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can give an idea as to what this flood of refugees will report in terms of how many of them can be included in the resettlement programme .
I am convinced that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to abolish this visa requirement .
After all , it is not a food inspector or an EU food safety agency that discovered pollution , but a company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
Therefore , we should develop our vision of military capabilities by emphasising soft power and prevention in order to launch a new programme of action that has previously existed but has become clear only in Munich , since President Obama &apos;s policy enables us to enter a new phase in the decommissioning negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been ready for some time in the Committee on Budgets .
In December , representatives of the MoDem party voted against the appointment of President Barroso as he did not propose his re-election on the basis of his activities .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that the emphasis is on good animal welfare , that animals are living in conditions suitable for the species concerned and that animals are strong and resistant to the principle of &apos; better prevention than cure &apos; .
We therefore fear that , if the scope of the directive is extended , it will be exactly the same as the last attempt to introduce &apos; made in &apos; origin marking , which is that the Council will once again stop it .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to add my voice to the suggestion of my colleagues that politicians , Member States and the European Union should put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of efforts to boost the economy .
In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States - the budget deficit in both countries exceeds 10 % - significant corrections are needed to restore the sustainability of public finances .
We should not confuse individual issues , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme should give his opinion on the new Hungarian media law , and I do not think that is his job .
It is clear that freedom of expression is not in China either .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from being an insult to wine producers who seek quality , especially in Prové , it would be unacceptable to give legitimacy to an annex product made from mixture of finished products and to allow misleading references to rosé .
Much remains to be done .
What happens if people in rural areas of Europe lose their jobs and our food production capacity will be reduced ?
Let us not forget either that , despite these institutional issues , the Swedish Presidency &apos;s work - and indeed the autumn - will have a great deal to influence , on the one hand , the need to make progress on climate change or the financial crisis and , on the other , the unrest that the lack of a strategy for job creation in Europe creates , and so many important issues will have to be addressed .
I would like to stress that we are all aware that many of the texts required for police and judicial cooperation will need a new legal basis , enabling Parliament to play its role as colegislator .
I would also like to commend the rapporteurs for neglecting the ethical element which , of course , falls within the competence of the Member States .
This is good , and it is , after all , young people who will determine the future of Europe , but we must not forget those who made a very significant contribution earlier to building Europe .
In other words , we are preparing an economic recovery plan in which we are giving three and a half billion to the oligarchy of energy giants , and not a single euro for the partners we need to help them switch to green energy .
Halks and stock management are essential in order to prevent the total overfishing of inland waters and oceans .
We would have liked to have seen Parliament &apos;s resources increased by means of redistribution and increased efficiency and not by increasing the overall budget .
In addition , this package could demonstrate how the European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , effective and constructive way in such an important area .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s reasoned approach , which is focused on the initial stage of the procedure , in other words , improving the effectiveness of first-instance procedures , will enable us to assert real economic activity in the medium term , will be encouraged by its considered proposal .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a positive report and we have managed to reach a consensus at first reading on the Animal Welfare Regulation .
We do not want to organise European jobs in countries where environmental requirements are not at EU level .
All the contributions were useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
The Presidency has worked hard to achieve a consensus among the 27 Member States , whose goal is to express European unity and will to overcome the crisis and to preserve the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak now as Vice-President of the European Parliament in charge of democracy and human rights , and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , we only devoted this money to two types of projects aimed at reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere , that is , at carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) and at building wind farms in the North Sea .
If the proposal was for EGF money to be paid out to workers made redundant in Britain , we would vote in favour of the payment and criticise us if we did not .
As far as the Court of Justice is concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational , but it is still in its infancy .
This is about our neighbours , and it is also about Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as remote Abkhazia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I and my colleagues in the Commission are very committed to including gender mainstreaming in all policies that we will be dealing with .
These projects contribute to eliminating the differences between systems in accession in the European Union and to promoting optimum use of the European Union &apos;s own energy sources .
Moreover , this approach is politically based , and I believe that Europe needs most of all more policies , and that is certainly one of the tasks of our Parliament .
The failure of FIFA is also the fact that no bulk technology has yet been introduced , although this has already happened in other sports .
After all , we can organise different training or workshops to provide real help to access EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas .
Others are using the lack of this policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral transactions with suppliers that often overlook the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
I also welcome the fact that we have managed to establish a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission as regards the legislative programme .
Many Member States have made considerable efforts to fulfil the obligations of the Pact .
The aim is for the EU to be able to take action on the major social challenges that affect all Member States and which cannot be overcome alone ( an ageing population , energy , water and food supply , sustainable development , combating climate change , etc . ) , as well as improving knowledge of how our businesses can innovate and increase their competitiveness .
Although we will be endorsing this resolution tomorrow , I see that there are some inconsistencies in this budget , and I would like to highlight two of these most important in my opinion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will also address governance issues for the global economy , especially financial regulation and timely tracking of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to go into a little more detail about this issue .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional support to workers who suffer the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market .
The problem is based on the will of Europeans , who no longer want to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment , which would be the necessary successes for accession .
This is an unthankful , difficult role .
This is the first place of our priority list .
However , EU support is crucial to ensuring the country &apos;s independence .
The Israeli Government is conducting colonialism in a forced way , and this is after having committed war crimes at the beginning of this year .
The assessments of experts and their further visits indicate that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to become a full member of the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal , like in the past , continues to have five surface long-liners .
an increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capacity which will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would also like to stress that there is a contradiction between the commitment of the government of Pakistan to freedom of religion and the leading role played by Islamic countries initiating a resolution against religious violation in the UN .
I am emphasising this afternoon because this is my sincere opinion .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , because it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , the rapid and coordinated intervention of European governments and institutions is essential , as is the introduction of equally important programmes for granting old cars , along with a corresponding reduction in the price of new cars , and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is a good but also apparent contradiction with the more than a significant entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which will bring together the powers that currently divide between the two pillars .
Madam President , &apos; Siker or failed , the question is &apos; .
Such a policy is doomed to failure if the people who work in the fisheries sector , from fishermen to fishermen , are not complying with the rules .
This inexpensive and ineffective parliamentary tsunami , which should put the carefully worded illusions of a accountable democracy while , at the same time , outrageously deceiving the electorate who sent us here .
This is a pity , as it seems that we should speak with one voice on this issue .
We are no longer saying that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy European industry to 100 % , and we are not saying that this is not of interest to us , because the issue of climate change must remain a priority .
The burden of debt is in the way of economic growth , and we are witnessing painful proof of this , not only in European countries , but also in the United States .
In addition , the report will also help make the various aviation agreements clearer and as simple as possible and lay down which criteria should be taken into account and monitored .
I am going to vote on the telecom package , but with some reluctance , because I believe that the basic principle of liberalising telecommunications at the highest level has been bettered by this directive .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
These taxpayers will have a greater impact and a lower cost if we can coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive on facilitating the obtaining of visas for Belarusian citizens in the EU and preparing a readmission agreement .
Let me give you one concrete example .
Take , for example , child education and schools .
We do not even know whether the standards of legal trade that we support will enter into force and work all over the world - some speakers have already highlighted this problem .
in writing . - ( PT ) The creation of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis is crucially important , an organisation that analyses and assesses the coordination of Member States &apos; measures in favour of sustainable quality growth .
in writing . - I voted for the change to the rules on vaccination against bluetongue ; for better vaccines to be used and for ease the bureaucratic burden on farmers .
I voted in favour of this report if it is to establish strong integrated EU policies .
I would like to abstain from expressing my deepest disappointment at the outcome of this summit , which has largely been below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payments are often a problem in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , but we should not insist on all efforts being made by citizens , because they are the only chance to emerge from this crisis as a winner .
In the United States , there is an early warning system for this .
One incident happened to my own voters , Andrew Symeou .
We must unite and defend our rights , our freedom and our democracy .
Put things up : this is what the European people asked for in the election of this Parliament , and that is what we must give them if , in five years &apos; time , more people will give up their bells .
The European Council itself discussed and adopted the sections for which it is responsible .
Consumers in households have increased by more than 80 % over the last decade .
I think it would be useful now if we really thought about how to strengthen the existing legislation properly .
The conclusions of the summit in this regard are very little .
To this end , the proposal proposes the use of single instruments to allow implementation and preventive measures in order to avoid problems with the recognition and translation of documents from other Member States , as well as the proposal to propose a form of certification of documents relating to the requirement on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because they take into account important policy areas and individual opinions .
In order to develop cooperation at European level , the Commission can support Member States with financial programmes .
For example , the Council &apos;s decision of 13 and 8 May 2002 provided Member States with the capacity to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes , which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - have even been part of the legislation in some Member States .
Thank you .
However , my vote should not be perceived as a &apos; support bizarre &apos; for the EU .
We are getting things moving ever further and , today , the Internet has changed our habits completely , partly because our lives are becoming ever more rude .
With regard to information , I can say that we are constantly providing information as soon as they are available .
Finally , the best investment is to invest in education and lifelong education for the young generation .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that a satisfactory solution has been found for these issues in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
However , these are thousands of people , many of whom travel to small children without adequate financial means .
It is a matter of completely different procedures in cases where requests are made to the Commission under the terms of the provisions of the possible future Treaty and when the petitions procedure is used to Parliament .
Human rights must be respected by all participants in the Middle East conflict .
in writing . - ( ET ) Mr President , the crisis in Greece raises questions as to whether we are able to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to face our responsibilities .
We know that the UNESCO has , however , indicated to the Chinese authorities the impact that development will have on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - Mr Schwab &apos;s report seeks to increase the safety of cars by introducing greater safety requirements for producers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown that we can act and that we are even more resistant .
If we express Parliament &apos;s position on external organisations , such as human rights organisations , which would have an impact and if an agreement is not reached , I hope that this is not the case , and if , as a result , it will not be possible for individual projects , I believe that Parliament &apos;s position will be supported and understood .
These Thursday afternoon meetings are increasingly returning points in the lives of this House , both in terms of the empty that we have observed and the way in which they are handled .
I think it is still not clear at all whether Moldova will be able to elect a President and , if this does not happen , there will obviously be new elections in the country next year .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 and then , 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , am in favour of this compromise , as it raises the issue of failures in democracy that women have been facing for years if they help their self-employed man in trade , in the craft industry , in small and medium-sized enterprises or in a free-handed area without recognising their work over the years .
Of course , our political preferences are visibly different and sometimes conflict with each other .
I believe that this would be a fair distribution of the burden of climate change , because it is a link between the developing countries and the developed countries , and the intention to present a credible proposal for financing measures to reduce and adapt to the effects of climate change , on the one hand , and to show that we are ready to go along with it , on the other .
I would therefore like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of State aid for the banks - the banks benefited from this support , but not the social approach .
I have not only three children , but also a tsunami who is now wearing milk .
We are ready to establish technical assistance programmes to accompany the difficult austerity measures to be imposed by the Greek authorities .
We look forward to the Commission being prepared for this file .
As you mentioned , we need to update our statistics , which are provided for by Eurostat .
I am sometimes wondering whether we have really learned the lessons from our actions properly , when we are not following European solutions , but trying to find something concrete , even if we have to deal with it together .
e-mails also reveal that scientists in theory have been excluded from the peer review process , so that the public investigation does not reveal a lack of research .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has shed light on this dark side of our society , which we are still struggling with , and it is very difficult to fight .
We do not know the people we are dealing with now , and therefore the institutions must know about inspections , that they represent a greater risk and should therefore be subject to stricter examination .
In working on the revision of the RoHS Directive , we were particularly attached to setting safety requirements for electrical and electronic devices intended for distribution in the European Union .
Prevention work is carried out mainly in schools , as drug addiction is the main threat to this age group .
It has been expanded successfully and , at the end of the Cold War , the whole continent has been reunited and we are now calling on it to preserve the acquis that has been achieved and to continue integration once better times have come .
Many Members want an answer this evening and , given the fact that they are to be discussed in a disciplinary way .
But those of us who took part in this know that there was no choice to solve the problems of the dairy sector and hopefully we are already on the right path to solving some of the problems in the sector .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully recognises the need for provisions on maternity and paternity , we have chosen to abstain from such references in this report , as we oppose any policy of family at EU level being imposed , as the decision is a matter for national governments .
Last but not least , I think that the next negotiations on this subject will have to deal with EUBAM Rafah : how this mission can be revitalised and , where possible , extended .
So the Commission is looking at the situation and will act if necessary , but I believe that we must not go beyond the structures of Community law and that the Commission will remain within the framework of Community law in any case .
Since we share the common idea of creating a European diplomatic service that is not just the expansion of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we are debating today are essential and will be voted on tomorrow .
in writing . - In view of the persistent gaps between men and women in terms of employment levels , access to wages and managerial posts , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislation .
I abstained from voting on the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I would really like to try to persuade the Commissioner to promise him that no further progress will be made in the next few weeks before the fugitives are given to the Hague .
We will shortly deal with this subject in the debate on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The European Parliament has today , Wednesday , 20 October , adopted the report of the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
It is already the case that , in the near future , taxes will be higher in order to keep public finances high .
The time has now come for us to call loudly for freedom of religion for Christians and other religions .
In the Union , 31.5 % of women work part-time ( 30 or less hours ) , compared with 8.3 % of men .
I share the cautious optimism of the members of the committee and the ministers , and I feel that the company is in exile , although there are still many clouds .
Even then , even fewer of us were able to assume the scale of the economic crisis coming .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction and has shown that it is on the side of the consumer .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this truly excellent report .
This policy has become a key feature of the recovery package ; it represents added value , supports the efforts for modernisation and sustainable economic growth and , as such , it embodies European solidarity .
It is also very unfortunate that we still do not know whether the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force before it enters into force , while it is clear that we have to put it into effect without further hesitation .
However , I believe that the situation clearly demonstrates the final vulnerability of the agricultural industry , in my region , if farmers are to stand in the streets for days to come to an attempt to obtain modest EU funding .
The southern Member States of the EU have been too late for too long .
This must be achieved in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy , with the achievement of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
Let us express our will in democratic vote , representing the electorate of our countries , so tomorrow it will be very important .
It has to be said that housing is absolutely necessary for all , especially in modern welfare society .
In my opinion , the definition of priorities , which should be a thorough overhaul of a political instrument , must be transparent and democratic .
This specific project concerns the deployment of the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , once again , the fear has prevailed in Vojvodina , particularly by Hungarians .
The text on which we are voting today is the result - sometimes difficult - of a compromise , and I know that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have reached a practical and workable solution on our behalf .
in writing . - We agree with the following points in this proposal : does Parliament have the right to take part in the negotiations and to receive information on the Commission &apos;s plans ; does the President of the Commission and Parliament consider citizens &apos; initiatives to be a joint matter ; carrying out impact assessments ; is no binding right ( as we do not agree on the implementation of the so-called soft law and tailored directives ) ?
You all know that there can be no broadcasting spectrum without access to radio frequency , and it is up to European Union policy to ensure that all market players have access to radio frequencies without discrimination .
This will provide the Commission with a general and very comprehensive framework for action to promote gender equality in the areas in which my fellow Member has just mentioned : from employment to other areas in which it is important to ensure and guarantee equality .
We are looking forward to presenting offers to other stakeholders in politics and in the economy , which many of them have not done so far .
Dementia , and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular , are not only a serious problem on a health basis , but also very sensitive ethical and social issues , which , with the ageing of the European population , will only be increasingly serious .
I would also like to say that you have carefully pointed out that the responsibilities cannot be reconciled , so I do not want to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States or of the European level either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , let me start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs who have tackled this issue in detail : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have proclaimed our hand , together with the full support of all the European institutions , and ask Minsk to accept this because , together with the people of Belarus , they can gain a lot .
We must keep a close eye on this because , according to the President , EUR 38 billion a year will be saved to European businesses .
Now , following the ruling against Liu Xiaobo , we have also seen that the police prohibited a party representing homosexuals , which clearly indicates that a political era will begin in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , your statement today on Ukraine was very clear .
In addition , we must acknowledge that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved , because a majority of the regulations can only be adjusted properly through parliaments and that this process , as well as the processes relating to transatlantic legislators &apos; dialogue and the transatlantic assembly , is of paramount importance .
Someone mentioned helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am pleased that you are here and I have been able to hear your speech .
I would like to highlight this in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a strong message to women in their spouses working in a self-employed capacity .
Anyone who can witness the horrific suffering of the people in Gaza after the conflict .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States are , from a strategic point of view , the most important relationship of the European Union .
I must say that we are working towards a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and more with less money .
At the same time , many participants in the Copenhagen meeting give me hope that such large allied measures can finally lead to success .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , I am in favour of the motion not being a resolution , as I think Mr Schulz said something very important : if we really want this debate to be about the whole of Europe and not just about Italy , then there is no point voting on a resolution entitled &apos; freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
Parliament &apos;s recommendation proposes that the Council &apos;s legislative proposal be approved without further delay , because the new legislation will simplify the issue of procedures and ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals legally residing in the field of social security .
This is a very shocking percentage , and I mentioned this figure in one of my reports during the previous legislative period in Parliament .
However , the EU &apos;s Arctic policy is perhaps not even as grotesque as Baroness Ashton , the former young left , will be appointed as High Representative for Sarah Palina .
One of these is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded in the European Union , which should be the benchmark of our subsequent bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party &apos;s proposal to freeze the budget at the 2013 level because I believe it is necessary to reduce it and their position is a weak starting point for negotiation .
With regard to the car industry , I think that we have attached too little importance to the development of new types of cars in force , those that operate with hydrogen , batteries or fuel cells .
Then everyone goes down their own way .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , let me thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her report on her initiative , which concerns artistic studies in the European Union .
As a Thailand partner , the European Union is , as far as it can , ready to support the country in this complex process .
In fact , in order to ensure that this derogation , which is expected to create jobs and prosperity , will , in fact , benefit local populations and will not harm the European fishing industry , it will be necessary to carry out its impact assessment as soon as possible and , if necessary , to suspend it .
This is exactly what the Commission and the Council are doing now , and it is in a very laudable way , in order for gas transport to be restored as quickly as possible ; of course , it is not the most effective way to act if we are threatened with legal steps .
It is vital that the Member States investigate without delay the extreme human rights violations of Roma women , that the perpetrators be punished and that all those who have been injured are identified and that they are offered a good charge .
( LT ) Mr President , this topic is quite complex .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperating with national supervisory bodies , but also - as this has not been mentioned - the importance of cooperating with national parliaments and , in particular , with the budgetary and budgetary monitoring bodies that deal with European affairs .
I would suggest that now that , when the European External Action Service enters into force its rules on access to information and documents , it should be a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens , which does not treat foreign policy as if it were the exclusive area of mysterious diplomats .
At present , all countries are changing their economic policy to get out of a bad economic situation as soon as possible and achieve at least a small level of economic growth .
Let me also say something about the Japanese people .
It may be an internal matter , and Italy &apos;s case is not an internal matter .
We are therefore one of those who believe that this should not be weakened , but preserved and strengthened further .
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity come directly from the Christian tradition .
Although this is useful for large companies , the same thing is destroying public transport and is also responsible for the diminishing state of safety in the network and in safety .
On the other hand , the discussion of Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot be left to one side .
The risk must be tackled effectively and - as the tragic events in Japan remind us - urgently .
The aim of the agreement is to provide greater protection to workers against the risk of sharp injuries from the use of certain medical devices .
In short , perhaps this is the end of this report this evening , but the work is far from over , either for me or for the European institutions .
Firstly , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and I would like to stress that my group has been very careful with the adoption of SIS II due to a number of concerns about data protection , from the outset .
It is necessary to establish appropriate conditions .
In 2009 , 3098 and in 2008 , 3406 complaints received to the Ombudsman , which is a 9 % reduction .
In its October decision , the Court also clearly rejected compulsory retirement when the retirement age was reached .
There are major opportunities in EGNOS and in GNSS for the smooth operation of security , environmental protection and road transport , which can also be used to charge road charges .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for almost one third of the budget , it remains the only budget area in which the estimated error rate is over 5 % .
I would , of course , also like to thank the rapporteurs for their report , which has majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposed exit from the crisis towards a green economy , namely green energy , broadband networks and innovation , is aimed at expanding large businesses to new , profitable sectors and not protecting the environment or meeting the needs of grassroots classes .
That is why I share your concern that you have expressed about distorting national disputes or strange objectives that are so important to the Hungarian Presidency and not what unites us .
I agree with the conditional payment of costs based on prior approval , in justified and precise cases where cross-border healthcare involves at least one &apos;s hospital residence , as well as the need for special and costly medical equipment , in particular , for the patient or the population in general , to be at particular risk .
The most important way of doing this would have been , and will continue to be , to strive for stricter emissions reduction targets of at least 30 % .
This abuse is particularly detrimental to those actors who are making real efforts to alleviate environmental damage .
The recent visa scandals , of course , show the weak approach some states are taking with regard to the issuing of visas .
We are once again leaving the population of the rural areas most in need of them .
I know that they are capable of meeting these challenges .
- I warmly welcome the President of the Czech Republic to the European Parliament .
Orbán Viktor has not presented himself as a consensual European politician before the groups of the European Parliament , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; which defends the Hungarian people against &apos; attacks .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I have a positive opinion on this report and I congratulate Mr Szájer on it .
Therefore , we need the help of Russia to persuade Iran not to build a nuclear bomb .
I am totally opposed to the US concept of preventive bombing and also against NATO &apos;s intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for Europe &apos;s stability .
( IT ) Mr President , the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is very important , which allows the creation of a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
If this is achieved , we will commit ourselves to creating the conditions whereby the fisheries sector is sustainable and able to develop effectively in the long term .
There is no doubt that the beautiful Arctic conditions are difficult , but there is also no doubt that new technologies and development will inevitably open up the prospect of greater exploitation of natural resources in the region , which is an excellent example of fisheries .
The unemployment rate for young people at the beginning of this year has reached 20 % as a result of the economic crisis , while the school drop-out rate has reached 17 % , mainly for young people in rural areas .
Nowadays , there is a huge influx of environmental labels , pictures and texts that may disrupt consumers : from the boys containing hazardous substances to the claims on foodstuffs that they are carbon neutral or even environmentally friendly cars .
in writing . - We were opposed to this motion as it means giving European countries the responsibility for the underdeveloped third world rather than shifting on to the relevant countries .
rapporteur . - Madam President , please excuse me for taking up your time to delay the lunch , but I am going to do so for 10 years , so I hope you will not mind .
This is a sensitive working cycle in which improvements need to be made , and he simply does not experience enough of this .
Last year , we agreed to repeal these standards , and although consumers were unable to notice many differences , our producers did , and this is still the case .
I believe that the proposals contained in this package are not ambitious enough , because they are only in tune with austerity and cuts in the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) budget to be reduced , as it would mean that agriculture is likely to have less value in Europe .
At the same time , the premature closure of such a huge installation in economic calculations entails huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express , frankly , the Commission &apos;s satisfaction at the compromise proposal that has been reached .
Mr Valdis Zatlers , President of the Republic of Latvia , is a great pleasure for all of us to welcome you in your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the drama has been resolved .
If we conclude an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration can take place and there is a readmission agreement - and that is the objective - and therefore the European Union &apos;s agreements with third countries are consolidated - and that is the global approach and philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum - it is what happens that the borders of the Member States of the Union will be strengthened .
We regret that the report did not adopt our proposal , but we welcome the fact that there is a conclusion that is very similar to ours .
Knowing that the creation of a more competitive agricultural system in the open world trade environment is a job for the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner in the Chamber to ask him how he can see his cooperation with his colleague in charge of agriculture in the negotiations concluded as part of the Doha Round .
The report proposes simplifying financial supervision and control and strengthening the technical and scientific evaluation through a peer review based on excellence .
In view of this , the proposals made here today must be reviewed , analysed and understood .
It is also necessary to point out the legal and administrative obstacles ( legal entities , funding rules and , at times , intellectual property rights ) , which may depart a large number of important researchers and SMEs from participating .
I would like to know whether , based on the considerations listed above , the Commission will revise Directive 2007 / 52 / EC .
I therefore also voted in favour of the provisions on corporate social responsibility .
We can see that the new question that has been agreed is a very slow step forward in the area of transparency and that , thanks to the new regulations on access to documents , people who lead the infringement procedure or who request infringement proceedings clearly have less opportunity to know why these procedures have been closed or launched .
Like my colleague , Mr Charles Tannock , I would like to say that this House , which is unfortunately always half empty at that time , is not the first time we are discussing the outrageous human rights situation in Burma .
The role of society , therefore , is to enable women and men to decide freely which option they choose , because both of them have a broader perspective .
Nowadays , it promotes the consumption of products with a lower nutritional effect , putting thousands of livestock farmers who are unable to sell their produce in a country which produces 50 % of its needs in a difficult situation .
We do not yet see clearly what the current situation will have on our portfolios and on our business careers .
In the framework of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is at least as important as ever - perhaps even more importantly .
Fossil fuels are a centralised , hierarchical and inflexible distribution of energy .
In this regard , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members who spoke before me .
( HU ) Thank you for the floor , Madam President , I have come to the forefront of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union , so it is worth looking at the results that have been achieved .
I believe that the review of the first railway package should identify the problems facing Member States which have received justified opinions from the Commission and should also define methods for resolving them .
Israel , for its part , does not realise that such excessive military reaction will create new potential suicide bombers and , for the first time , will attract more Kassams .
The Burmese authorities have ignored the fact that many countries and organisations are protesting against the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and are calling for his release , including the Secretary-General of the United Nations , the Secretary-General of ASEAN , as well as many Member States of the ASEAN , to which Burma is finally a member .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
As the rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , pointed out , the guarantee of loans to the EU budget at the end of 2009 was almost EUR 20 billion , which is a large sum even compared to the Union , and I think that Parliament can rightly expect some explanation of the risks associated with this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but I would like to now also , on behalf of Timo Soini , and for my part , to explore the information on this project that the citizens of all the countries in the Baltic Sea require before the construction works begin .
Without active contributions from the Czech Republic , this decision would not have been possible .
I believe that a campaign of information on this issue is essential .
Since 1999 , it has , in fact , been unable to verify the validity of the identity documents for people living in Kosovo .
Action has been taken in this area , too , and clear and precise rules have been introduced in this area .
Does the Federal European United States , which Mr Corbett drew up , or does he take a lazer image of Europe , defined by free trade , which my party supports ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report presented today .
This is not an impunity - impunity is continuing , as you have been doing for years .
You rarely meet someone with so many values .
I firmly believe that everyone in Slovenia agrees with the immediate implementation of such stress tests .
It is not a good sign that some Member States do not want an employment summit on Thursday .
We have seen that much has been done to meet the requirements and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
In these circumstances , the decision to allow the Moldovan Government to force its citizens to finance precarious European programmes and agencies such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the ATM Research Programme in the context of the Single European Sky ( SESAR ) is cynical - although Moldova is not even a member of the European Union .
In this way , we will have two birds with one stone , because this investment can boost European counteract , create jobs and alleviate the impact of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in the autonomous area of Hanti-Maniji , it was agreed that our common objective was to reach a strategic agreement that would provide a comprehensive framework for relations between the EU and Russia in the near future and contribute to making use of the potential of our relationship .
It is now clear that we are not meeting the requirements of the Mediterranean and , in particular , of Libya : we need to respond more to the recognition that perhaps more decisive action is needed to understand what is actually happening and what is really needed in terms of coordinated action for the Mediterranean .
The European Union has made provision for support : the local population must support the project and Italy must provide itself with the appropriate private investor &apos;s backing .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , reports of accession to the Balkan states showed us .
That is why we abstained from voting on the proposals of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on the Portuguese TVI issues , although it is known that the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of this situation .
The Committee on Development has proposed country-by-country reporting systems for transnational companies to produce their own reports .
A key issue is also the problem of prostitution and the trafficking of women , which is included in the report .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to speak openly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , on the completion , the work of the Court of Justice will not end with the arrest and trial of Mr Mladić and Mr Hadžić .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the claims submitted by deceived breeding producers who have not been aware of their own animals .
I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) in order to increase the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find solutions , we must continue to deal with this .
However , you know that our main message is about structural reforms ; structural reforms are absolutely essential in order to increase Europe &apos;s potential for growth and increase Europe &apos;s capacity to create jobs .
This partnership may , in particular , be of great importance during the current global financial crisis , while also opening up greater opportunities for trade , scientific and technological exchange , enabling us to emerge from this crisis in a stronger , more stable situation .
Inaction cannot be tolerated any longer .
in writing . - The approval of the Lisbon Treaty and its entry into force mean increased responsibility for Parliament and the administrative burdens that it entails .
At this time of unprecedented crisis , which has caused the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that the number of unemployed or poor people in work ( working ) in Europe is not reached 25 million in 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to stress once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption , which I , together with four other MEPs , have proposed , and half the Members of the European Parliament have approved , with the main objective of committing themselves to legislation by the Council and the Commission that is truly effective in the fight against corruption .
Mr President , the presidents of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group wholeheartedly supports the programme of presidencies of Parliament and Parliament for the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let these promises become a reality .
We believe that it is precisely through this type of dialogue that we will be able to help these countries , especially through increasing the involvement of civil society .
While I believe , as a socialist , that the guilla war in Sri Lanka does not result , I must say that the Tamil people do indeed have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
This is the right moment to advocate simpler , less costly measures for SMEs , which will naturally lead to more jobs and greater growth .
In order to combat counterfeiting of medicines , it is very important for uniform security measures to be introduced within the European Union , including in the new package .
When we talk about group claims , the issue of America , experience and extremism arises .
The immediate entry into force of the EU-US extradition and legal assistance agreements would increase both cooperation in the area of criminal law and the elimination of the grey area that has enabled extraordinary renditions to be used .
I have three proposals and I would very strongly like to ask for your support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has repeatedly requested specific cases in which it states that a sports activity is a service with a purely social impact or , on the contrary , also has economic aspects , which means that it has a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is the most important priority of this institution , and citizens must know about it .
In time , it will turn out whether this will prove to be an insignificant impact or whether the directive will undoubtedly have positive effects .
By modernising the freight logistics and promoting co-modality , that is , the possibility of optimal combination of different modes of transport in the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase the well-being of the Baltic region .
It should fall within the competence of the Member States to decide whether or not they wish to ratify this ILO Convention within the framework of a democratic procedure .
According to Eurostat , the minimum income in January 2011 was between EUR 123 per month in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that will be adopted will not be so bad .
I was disappointed in many ways at the Copenhagen Summit .
We call on international , governmental and non-governmental donors to stop working in certain areas if the draft law is adopted .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights and an aspect that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you , Mr President .
Václav Havel said to us today that Europe is the birthland of our homeland .
So if I were to ask a police in Slovakia , he would be obliged to answer Slovak , in vain Hungarian in his mother tongue , and I completely do not understand his response .
( DE ) Madam President , once again , I would like to draw attention to an area of transatlantic cooperation , the police and judicial issues relating to SWIFT , which have already been mentioned earlier , that is , the transfer of SWIFT banking data to the US .
In 2009 , we witnessed the alarming increase in various forms of national protection , which were used both in individual EU Member States and in new developing countries .
In the case of SWIFT , the Commission and the Council did not take the issue of transparency seriously .
Finally , on the political front , it is important to have an ally in the ACP countries within the World Trade Organisation .
Something else needs to be done .
If we can help to find each other for an abandoned family that wishes to have children , then we have made a very significant contribution .
Therefore , as one of the important steps to promote the success of the 2020 strategy is , first and foremost , to talk about how important it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing with one another and to cooperate honestly on the tools without which it is not possible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza also encourage us to look more strategically and in the longer term .
Further indicators are needed , which highlight the factors affecting a country &apos;s standard of living .
According to Orvosi experts , treatment of good medicines can be delayed by up to a year when the patient will have to get expensive care homes .
Mr Tajani , the Commissioner for Industry and Enterprise Policy , has promised to study losses in the sector .
Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions aimed at implementing the Council &apos;s decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be about the situation in the European Parliament to a large extent .
In the current turbulent global context , at a time of economic and financial crisis , the EU must step up its strategic autonomy in order to maintain its values , pursue its interests and protect its citizens by devising a common vision of fundamental challenges and threats , and by providing the necessary resources and capabilities to provide a suitable response and thus contribute to the preservation of international peace and global security .
The time is right for relations between the two parties and the results of the current global agreement are good .
The common register will result in greater transparency in the EU institutions and I hope that it will increase the legitimacy of the Union &apos;s citizens .
I propose that you look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
the report by Corien Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the surveillance and coordination of budgetary positions - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
However , if we are to deal with this problem successfully , we must support our actions in this area with strong and decisive political measures .
My last point , Mrs Ronzulz , is that of warning .
I would like to see a clear deadline for these exclusions and a firm benchmark on these exclusions , however structured , perhaps the Commission could look at proposals that it intends to put forward to meet India &apos;s demands .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I really heard you say that you were sitting in the eye of the Italian Prime Minister , except for the fact that you are doing the job of tens of thousands of people thanks to entrepreneurial activities .
Whether this is timely or not is now , it must , of course , be examined by Parliament itself .
This report is therefore intended to highlight the importance of an unknown programme , but also to call for changes to the administrative and financial provisions that are too burdensome and the low success rate , which is still far too closed at a time when small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are playing an important role in ensuring that research results are reflected in products and services ; better cooperation between the various players and the funding of national research in a period when it is still being carried out .
What is really important is that the ECB has not been independent in the Greek crisis ; it has chosen its side .
It will not make our industry uncompetitive .
He has demanded a worldwide ban on so-called &apos; downloading scanners &apos; .
Statistics figures show that around 4.3 million people die from circular diseases in Europe every year and more than 1.7 million die from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective health measure to protect European citizens from infectious diseases , but it is also important that health services also reach developing countries in order to contribute to increasing life expectancy and combating poverty .
And , therefore , it should be said openly that the abuse of the banks by the new rules , which were introduced within the euro area with the aim of increasing their incomes to the detriment of our citizens , is a flagrant lie .
In this economic situation , and here in the European Parliament , it is imperative that we ensure that spending is controlled .
I therefore believe that increased protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is crucial for European competitiveness .
It has played a very important role , as it has followed all the negotiations before the Supreme State Security Court and has carried out regular assessments of the conditions of detention in Syria .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters and we need greater cooperation and coordination between the various Community instruments .
At that time , it appeared that all the new Member States are respecting the principles of the Union , the prohibition of discrimination , the protection of linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
It is not only financial credit that has been reduced , but also social credit .
The new measures would allow European citizens and businesses to benefit from the enforcement of their rights , notably with regard to qualifications , social rights and the right to reside .
The issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a one-off issue .
In its conclusion , the Council is urging the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to preparing , if necessary , an EU legislative proposal for the area of biological waste which has been broken by 2010 .
It is a fact that men have the right to participate fully in the events of a few days after the birth of a child .
These intentions deserve recognition , not criticism , although that is not the point here .
It is a fact that the EU must build a complete dependence on Russian energy sources .
( RO ) Madam President , today Canada is the European Union &apos;s 11th largest trading partner ; in 2010 , trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounted for a total of 1.6 % of EU foreign trade .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the rapporteur who introduces this in the Rules of Procedure was not myself but Marylène Renault .
The country &apos;s own fishing sector is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are four reports in this debate today , and I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the cooperation of the European Commission .
With regard to the summit , I fully agree that this is an important occasion .
This regulation simplifies the rules on cabotage , which - and I am particularly reminding of Mr Grosch &apos;s remark - must be applied coherently and not bureaucratic throughout the EU , without touching on cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that he would like to welcome China &apos;s representatives to study the documents of his incoming government in exile , so that they can be convinced that he has not instigated violence .
This is their answer to the question that has brought their development and integration into the world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Recently , we have heard a lot of demagogic statements every day , without any technical basis , in the media and here in the European Parliament .
Since respect for human rights is one of the main aspects of a binding agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the autonomous trade preferences proposed to this country must be made conditional on respect for human rights .
That is why I voted in favour of the directive on energy efficiency in buildings , because we expect this to have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it has a direct impact on the construction of buildings in which they live and work .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position on the principles on which the European Union has been built , including , albeit temporary , derogations from four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not agree that this is an acceptable reason for Parliament to demand a bigger budget .
It is time to finally put an end to this unilateral privilege that America enjoys .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would be pleased if , now that this directive is ready , it would give greater attention to the regulation on social security , which is the foundation of all this and which clearly defines who is supported and where it is well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common objective and work with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way to keep the Arctic for future generations .
I think this was very necessary and it provides a good example of the success that Parliament has achieved in shaping the budget by using resources which , as I say , have not been used in other areas .
We are now looking at the assumptions .
For this to happen , we must make every possible effort to keep the limits on the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In sensitive sectors , such as clothing , leather and furniture manufacturing , companies which have chosen to protect European knowledge and European jobs , it is essential to create the conditions for consumers to have the opportunity to make choices .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of decades , the international community has not managed to put a stop to this extremely destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument , promoting and strengthening relations with third countries , offering tangible benefits .
Moreover , it is not just about you .
In such cases , the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to express its opinion .
With this draft document , however , we have gone beyond this limit , but we have made an enterprise because of the needs to do with patient care .
The Committee on Budgets is aware of the importance and the urgency of the proposals .
All patients have the right to receive quality care and care in their native language , close to residential areas , where their families can easily achieve .
When we speak in this Chamber , we should use the phrase that everyone accepted , and we adopted FYROM as a candidate country , as a &apos; FYROM &apos; and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
That is feasible and it would produce better results .
The recent developments in the European economy , not least in Greece , have shown the urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
In order to go beyond it , their donor , Stuart Wheeler , said that membership costs GBP 120 billion per year , which is approximately 36 times the real figure .
The two-fold approach to Belarus - the &apos; unker and carrot &apos; , as I believe Mr Tannock said - will hopefully be successful .
We could very much talk about a number of other issues - energy , nuclear non-proliferation , which we can only imagine , but I believe that the important thing is that the three reports tabled today contain the fundamental agreement that we worked on recently .
Secondly , you said that the Commission would do well to look at the potential of Eurobonds - at last !
Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information ( debate )
This is not the credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Enterprise and SMEs
According to the regulation , tyres must be labelled or used by suppliers of tyres in order to inform users about fuel consumption , rolling resistance , nutrition performance and the value of external rolling fuel .
We fully respect the right of Member States to decide for themselves whether or not to implement the Lisbon Treaty .
In an attempt to achieve bolder and even more ambitious results , I also believe that in the last stage of COP 16 negotiations , the European Union must give its principal negotiator a certain amount of flexibility so that it can respond to the developments that will develop in the negotiations .
It is therefore essential for the measures to be balanced and transparent , because winning entrepreneurship &apos;s confidence is a prerequisite for success in this project .
There is also the problem of the disastrous impact of extensive urbanisation on the environment , particularly on coastal areas and on Spanish islands , but also on other areas , such as Madrid .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia monitor the situation very closely , in close cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
These procedures must cover the necessary maintenance and supervision of after the closure ; the processing , storage and pollution of waste ; the environmental rehabilitation of installations ; support for supplying the energy accommodation of modified power stations , particularly environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I believe in this .
I come from a country where I come to vaccine every time , I see a engine club on the back of a painter with a smoke .
For example , there was a debate on the selling of land to developing countries and countries with no landscape ; this is , in itself , a very interesting topic , and I think we will be able to find common ground in this area .
However , without an all-European network , we will not achieve the European Union &apos;s key objectives .
In Europe , tobacco is produced on 17 of the 27 Member States , and in every case , governments are also giving their support to this .
One of the three languages - English , French or German - will be used to guarantee automatic legal protection throughout the EU .
This is a very controversial topic in Ireland and it brings the bin to those who advocate voting in favour of the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency has done everything in its power to reach a consensus , but in the end , it has decided that this issue should be decided by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that in some cases , we have different opinions .
That is how the Commission is doing its job .
This may , in turn , be a one-off problem linked to the relocation of the agency &apos;s long-term office .
The proposed amendments will also allow the less developed Member States , such as Romania , to have the right to make use of the fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many in all the parliamentary groups praising the Belgian Presidency , which deserves to be completely praised .
The importance of these subjects may not be stressed in these circumstances .
We will work together to bring the Doha Round to a positive conclusion in 2010 , as this is extremely important in our efforts to promote recovery from unfavourable economic times and combat protectionism .
Ladies and gentlemen , today is a somewhat special day for me , because after 10 years of good and faithful service this was my last sitting here in Brussels , in Brussels .
From an effective point of view , I also consider it interesting to propose that these delegations also cover certain consular functions , such as the handling of Schengen visas .
It seems that we have spent a lot of time discussing each other on a daily basis , rather than doing this with others and , ultimately , treating us thoroughly .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s draft should be better prepared and that Parliament should leave more time to make a decision .
Perhaps there are plans to move forward from what we are currently tabling .
Without the European Union and its protective shield , all Member States would be in a much more serious situation .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the significant progress that India has made on primary education , poverty reduction and access to drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso said in his hands , with the Treaty of Lisbon , that the Commission is a spokesperson for the European Union on environmental issues .
There can be free expression of opinion , there may even be disagreements , even Eurosceptics will be accepted , but the outcome can only be one .
Lukashenko , who is a clever political player , is able to take advantage of his programme , has benefited from all political and economic benefits and , at the same time , continues to behave with contempt for democracy and human rights .
The European Union and Russia hoped , on the other hand , that this same joint declaration would allow us to negotiate and conclude small-scale border agreements between Russia and the European Union &apos;s Member States , which might have an interest in neighbouring country .
This is crucial for the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , you personally talked about the gaps that need to be eliminated in many Member States in order to implement our legislation .
As a free citizen , we must respect these people .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything in our power to ensure that we can not only prevent environmental and health damage , but also reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot help but remind you that there is still international circles in place against Omar al-Bashir , which are not taken into account by the authorities of the country .
The letter also reaffirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to inform Parliament in a detailed report on the first year &apos;s operation of the project and the preparatory work on this has already begun .
Mr President , I expect you to respond to all this with a warning .
As far as the regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the draft is basically a good one when it comes to banning and increasing the replacement of pesticides which seriously harm human health .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to establish fishing opportunities for European Union vessels , as well as special financial contributions in exchange for the right to entry and sectoral support , based on the additional stocks available .
We in the European Union must give all the help we can to the new Tunisian unit government and to all EU citizens , including the British , who have spent their freedom in Tunisia and have been unable to leave the country .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation , as I believe that it is only right and proper that we should transfer Taiwan to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , it is often the case that these traditional means of communication fail because of commercial interests , or because their management is part of a certain political sphere , and indirectly obliges its employees to exercise self censorship .
We cannot live together in the European Union as long as this situation persists , so we consider it very important for the Commission , the authorities of the European Union and all of us to come up with similar proposals that put an end to this state of affairs .
That is one thing , and as I am committed to it , I will also make sure that all legislation is carried out on the basis of a series of social , environmental and economic criteria .
That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are talking about Belarus here in the European Parliament , but talk is not enough .
Mr President , I support this motion and I am speaking in favour of it .
Next , I am pleased that East Jerusalem is mentioned as the capital of the future Palestinian state or as Jerusalem of the two states .
The third lesson is that the European Union must equip itself .
However , there are also large differences between the individual regions within a Member State .
Prevention and elimination of violence against women are key strategic objectives which are important for achieving the progress that our civilisation wants to make .
I look forward to hearing your answers .
The preliminary results of the referendum held in ten southern states were published on 30 January and the results show that the overwhelming majority ( 9.5 % ) is in favour of secession .
Personally , I feel that Europe needs a unified energy policy , in order to avoid being too dependent on energy sources in one area .
The Food and Veterinary Office has found huge deficiencies in the monitoring system in Brazil and has encountered numerous shipments to the European Union which have not had the necessary certificates .
All the committees are now calling for each other .
Therefore , the most important question is : what and how can we build on the Swedish Presidency &apos;s results ?
The crisis draws attention to the need to strengthen the role of the European Union .
The central part of this proposal is the assertion that there should be mutual dialogue , that is to say , that they should be listened to and respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore Polish cauts and towns in regions in which the majority of the population is a member of the Polish minority .
As these steps are interlinked , it is essential and consistent with the magnitude of the efforts made in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights to achieve these ambitious final results as quickly as possible , in line with citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of this report because it improves significantly the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour .
The aim of the report is to achieve higher risk screening , to simplify bureaucratic supervision systems and to build greater confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I agree with the remarks made by Mr Daul .
The resolution adopted today highlights the fact that the joint register ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operators , while respecting their different and specific nature .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to put a question to the President of the Commission , who has taken up the events of the past weeks in the Mediterranean region , when many people have reached the European coasts , but many have lost out of business .
That is not the case , however , and the sad expression of this is the situation on the island of Lampedusa .
Israel is a bomb and it is a ghetto .
It is important to hear people &apos;s views , but it is also important that we learn from experience .
in writing . - The CAP and global food security are important issues .
I would like to thank you for this constructive and forward-looking debate .
It must be based on respect for human rights , democracy and the rule of law , for our commitments and for the values on which the European Union is founded .
The EU produces 3 % of its GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this respect , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled an amendment calling for the total , as soon as possible abolition of all forms of export subsidies , not only for Europe , of course , but also , as the Commissioner knows .
Most contributors stressed the need to change the CAP so that it focuses on the competitiveness of European agriculture , its capacity to respond to climate change , food security , quality standards and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , extremely important for the European Union to increase individual support for cities , because this is the biggest opportunity for the economy and finance , as cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will not be formally submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control for the next weekend .
In order to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions of 25 % to 40 % by scientists by 2020 , in order to stop the loss of biodiversity , we need very serious financial resources .
Only the joint application of the governments of these countries to music and cornerstone of the accession process can encourage them to concentrate on bringing down work and reforms that can once and for all bring stability and prosperity to the Western Balkans .
I myself would like to focus on two reports , given their importance .
In order to ensure the legal certainty of all parties involved , there must be equal rights for all persons accused of crime throughout Europe , and they must be informed on these rights .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy fall within national competence and we therefore voted against the report on this subject .
For the benefit of Mr Weber , I am speaking about Article D.
I was also pleased to note that the motion also gave a positive assessment of the continued efforts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what has happened in Greece for a few hours does not turn into a mess , and I also hope that , on the contrary , this can be the start of a single effort to shape European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have kept in contact with those who have been in Tunisia and with the Egyptian people , our delegations , to whom I pay tribute for what they have had to do in recent weeks and to be in direct contact with the government and the services .
I am really convinced that this financial instrument will be of increasing importance in the light of the financial crisis , as it will help businesses to be able to return to growth more effectively and will be able to play a role as a pilot project in the future in creating a major energy fund .
These controls were insufficient .
Then we will be able to provide a significant European contribution , but this barrel cannot be bound by bottlenecks .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman following the draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , which relates to excessive delays in responding by the Commission to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
Compared with the existing legislation , the greatest result achieved by the directive is that patients will be able to choose their health providers and have information on the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I repeat that it is necessary to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly and to review the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund in order to meet the needs arising from this tragedy .
After consulting consumer organisations and business world representatives , I believe that we must insist on greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I have already said that everyone who raises questions is a bad boy in this debate .
This means that Parliament has a right and a duty to follow the negotiations - in this case , trade negotiations - and to intervene politically , using the parliamentary instruments at its disposal , such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , in order to be better informed about the progress of the negotiations .
It does not recognise citizens &apos; investment in cohesion and in intergenerational solidarity .
However , the real reform is about admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights problems in the European Union today .
It is necessary to provide adequate financial resources for these purposes , which will enable the EU to seize opportunities and to take advantage of new sources of global competitiveness .
When the public authorities are in trouble , it is usually late in paying and often bankrupt businesses in many countries of Europe .
The G20 also made the elimination of tax havens one of its key objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
Of course , the dollar remains a plea of global transactions and still offers a secure investment facility , but the huge debt stock that the United States has accumulated , which has made the rest of the world realise that they are financing their way of life , is increasingly discouraging the magnitude of the doubt as to whether the world &apos;s number one economic powers will be able to fulfil their obligations .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and measures to fight against those who want to destroy this society .
It says that it is not in the interests of Iceland , as long as it was a rich country , to join the European Union .
This is not a new request , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent way of promoting sustainable development and involving all actors in order to ensure positive reception by the local population .
At the same time , this is a problem which extends the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions as long as the fighting continues in Afghanistan .
We must combat fragmentation , so I urge Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund in place in the regulations and not to divide into pieces as Parliament sometimes proposes .
Of course , it is inevitable that , in a compromise , all our wishes are not met .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for their constructive approach throughout the entire budget procedure , which also reflects very good cooperation .
The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been more advisable to stress that the negotiations were not held indefinitely and would thus open up a free route to more realistic alternatives , such as preferential association .
This is therefore the first and most important US problem that Washington must resolve .
Let me also add that we need to reform European universities by making our universities much more independent and European , more open to students and researchers , and by creating a dynamic development in the knowledge society .
They can retain the quota they buy in their national reserves and later on , if they so wish , divide it .
I therefore call once again for the International Day for the Ethermal Day for the Elimination of Totalitarianism , which , like Pilecki , has lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , to be remembered .
Allow me to say a brief word about the measures that we have taken .
If , in the next parliamentary term , this will be the majority opinion in the European Union , it would destroy the building of peace with a great deal of effort after the wars in the Balkans .
I very much hope that this will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I would like to warn , or I would like to see how EMAS is competing with the ISO , but because I believe that the system is good and can help to meet our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important and I think it will be good .
We can no longer tolerate currency dumping and its associated social consequences .
This aspect is essential for ensuring an effective Neighbourhood Policy .
We can lay the foundations for a coherent European policy on this issue by respecting the best practices of the Member States and by establishing basic standards , such as non-discrimination , fair and fair treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation .
I know that during public consultation on the Green Paper on agricultural product quality , those interested in promoting compulsory labelling of origin .
I am fully aware of the complexity of the problem , Mr Kelly .
Although most countries are facing economic and financial problems , particular attention needs to be paid to tackling the adverse effects of climate change .
I would ask for your support for this .
At the same time , however , we must accept that the report will give rise to a serious debate in Parliament on the reform of the system of own resources .
The overall eligibility of these measures has therefore increased .
President of the Commission . - The Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to give its opinion on the monitoring process .
For example , in the case of France and Spain , fraud rates are seen as &apos; dubious low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are looking for solutions , they are interested in whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to establish a network of statistics sharing in the Member States and a platform for coordinating the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view expressed by many in this House that the stronger European solidarity , the better relations between Europe and Russia .
Syria still has a long way to go with regard to freedom of expression and of assembly .
Much remains to be done to ensure that women have equal access to the labour market .
At the same time , I would repeat that the proposal must be reworked in such a way that it takes into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments are proposed in this regard :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy producers is untenable , Olle Schmidt and Cecilia Wikström .
I support this report because I would like to emphasise , in particular , a cause of concern that is mentioned , namely , that consumers do not have adequate and comprehensive information about the health implications , composition and origin of each species of fish .
After all , history is full of examples showing that Western countries have done more harm than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and does not , for many reasons , manage the issue of crime prevention .
This Palestinian agreement is a crucial political event and , contrary to what has just been said , Hamas has now , for the first time , agreed with the PFF and the Palestinian Authority operates as its negotiating partners .
Countries are debating and negotiating the way in which the seabed is distributed .
This latter is particularly important , given the problems of the energy infrastructure , which ...
In other words , it is precisely the institution that is doing the job of defendants to protect us from criminals , albeit indirectly by providing professional training to police offenders .
However , the fact that Fidel Castro gave power to his blood , Raoverty , has neither brought democratic reforms nor brought about the release of political prisoners .
The energy efficiency classification must also be indicated in all advertising , which includes information on energy consumption or the price of the product .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are all familiar with the Washington Consensus : yes , they have won it .
In this way , we can also respond to the real situation , which Frontex already faces .
I would like to conclude by thanking , once again , not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees concerned for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this issue and I very much appreciate the support of the Presidency for our efforts to find a viable way forward .
Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the private sector &apos;s corporate structure is particularly relevant to ensuring a balance between EU law , the market and the special needs of the European people .
This conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days .
Falsified medicinal products will only decrease and medicines will only be safe if we take these measures .
We must also learn lessons from the Opel case : it is not too late to present a coordinated European strategy for the automotive sector .
We have implemented these measures because , like you , President Obama and myself reject a false election between security and ideals .
Unfortunately , the euro package proposes making wage cuts permanent .
Recently , a new investigation was launched at Manchester Airport , and there is already a legal council that the use of this machine on minors could damage the provisions of child safety and protection through the nature of the image that has been created .
In addition , this money is not going directly to the artists .
In the field of civil aviation , the system should be supported and the use of EGNOS to manoeuvre .
The directive on vessel surveillance and investigation organisations and the Directive on the activities of maritime authorities ( recast ) - Regulation on shipping and ship inspection organisations ( recast version ) - The port State control ( recast version ) - Community monitoring and information system for vessel traffic - Rapporteur &apos;s liability for civil liability in the maritime transport sector - and maritime transport operators &apos; maritime transport operators - .
in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting in favour of the report establishing a new microfinance facility which will help to start or develop micro-enterprises for people at risk of unemployment .
I believe that it is important that we have made progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I strongly agree with , and I believe that this report will help us to have a better legal framework for urban issues and to introduce tools , such as municipal operational programmes , which can achieve a new standard in cohesion policy .
It has become clear to me during the trialogue negotiations that the improvements I tabled on behalf of Parliament are essential for the creation of a fair and efficient energy market .
At this time of economic crisis , it is extremely important that self-employed workers are given support and encouragement .
In short , their mobilisation does not require approval from Brussels .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , for us and for Europe , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for Europeans , it is clear that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , an element of change that is capable of uniting us and , at the same time , that is what concerns us today .
I voted in favour of this report because the food aid programme , which we are considering extending , is a key tool for helping those who are suffering greatly from the current economic crisis , even if aid meets their basic needs .
Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least one officially supported export credit agency , and these collectively constitute the largest source of official financing for private sector projects in the world .
We therefore do not support this report .
From our point of view , we have helped to overthrow the common government .
Mr Conseil français du &apos;s image with the creation of musulman in 2003 , Minister of the Interior , introduced Islam into the institutions of France .
On this issue , I have already asked for the opinion of the European Commission and for consideration to be given to the possibility of setting up specific programmes to achieve equal opportunities for women in the field of science .
This is a struggle that we will continue to fight to ensure that citizens &apos; rights are protected and that end users have unlimited access to services .
The great politicians and minds in Europe understood very well that only a common approach to economic problems can be the power that unites Europe .
The borders between freedom and security do not end at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , from the summer of this year , the Commission will take a leading role in coordinating the strategy , for example , in the development of major areas , such as the education of citizens &apos; knowledge , career orientation and the promotion of employment .
The costs will be borne by the country of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of what we could do for a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to open dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is particularly important for the stability of the region .
Therefore , we can accept that every 25 years a reactor accident is taking place .
In my opinion , the eligibility of housing from cofinanced expenditure by the ERDF should lead us in the medium and long term to consider other possible improvements , whether in terms of funding or in terms of allocating funds to certain strategic priorities .
Today , it is time to talk again about violations of religious rights in these two countries , this time in relation to the rights of Christians .
Climate change : one of the biggest threats facing the planet .
They have , of course , placed a great deal of emphasis on human rights , as I expected , the importance of human rights being clearly given a place in our dynamic relations and our work .
I must also say that , at present , the European Union does not have the competence to regulate air transport at all .
However , Europe is not a manoeuvre , nor is it a cure for the economic crisis .
I can thus confirm to our rapporteur the Commission &apos;s pledge on comitology and non-mandatory provisions .
I do not think that the friendly words that we have heard here today , even what the Commission has said , can change the facts that the European Union is not present in Libya and is currently unable to stop the crisis in cities or the activities of Gaddafi &apos;s ground troops .
For this reason , I firmly believe that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , it will bring enormous benefits to EU citizens , as it will be possible for them to make decisions that are much more informed about their own consumption .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I share the hope that , at the European Council meeting , an agreement will be reached on measures to reassure the markets , stabilise the euro area , as we are , whether we are part of it or not , in principle , that is in all our interests .
In particular , pre-accession aid funding has proved to be sensitive .
We must therefore give it our gratitude and be pleased .
We therefore call on all parties to put an end to war and violence , and we also urge the EU to do this .
The world outside of Europe faces the energy challenge with absolute insight .
Indicators that measure the energy efficiency of buildings will be obliged to indicate property and wage sales advertisements in the media .
It is essential to encourage the EU &apos;s efforts to increase investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , the creation of alternative , unconventional forms of energy and the improvement of infrastructure capacities for facilitating access to new energy sources at local level .
A well-developed infrastructure is the foundation for the efficient functioning of the internal market , which will ultimately lead to an increase in internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we must consider setting up a rapid response instrument within the ENP , so that we can respond immediately and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as was the case recently in the southern neighbourhood .
I am convinced that a person in this Parliament supports Serbia while at the same time deploring the EULEX mission is simply absurd .
The problem is , therefore , that only those who understand the language of the speaker can listen to you .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in order to be able to do our work well , we need to find consistency with those who gave us their votes , and I would like to pay tribute to the Swedish Presidency for drawing attention to issues that relate to our fellow citizens , our voters - the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime .
There are Members of the European Parliament who argue that the EU budget can compensate national budgets at a time of austerity , but this is not right ; the EU budget must reflect rather the plight of the Member States .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty does not authorise the Council to interfere with the national constitutions of the Member States .
That is not normality .
Provare cynical , but pupils do not always come to light , and tourists do not always arrive for a limited period of time .
Is it because of the global financial crisis that has turned into an economic crisis , or are we facing our mistakes , our carelessness and our inaction ?
The second &apos; but &apos; is related to the role that the Belgian Presidency has played in the period following the Treaty of Lisbon .
The primary objective of these regimes was to keep this large state on an ground , with a large number of peoples coming from each other .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians are already talking about the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with negative consequences .
This is the case with Japan in many areas , but I recognise , for example , the right of Japan to defend rice spaces and rice producers and to pay higher prices than global market prices and say &apos; no &apos; to mass imports , which would destroy the parasel sector - just as I acknowledge the right of our own economies to protect certain sectors .
( ES ) Mr President , I will be talking about two concepts , namely conciliation and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people are Internet users .
I am therefore ready to work on this new strategy to strengthen our social priority , and I said this to you even when we discussed the broader political lines for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will go straight to the subject and ask what measures - and I am using multiple numbers here - the Commission intends to take to address these shortcomings in the short term .
That is exactly what has been lacking and what has not been sufficiently clear to our citizens .
That is not of interest to the citizens , and rightly not .
( The sitting was closed at 09 : 10 )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal by approving by a large majority the report drafted by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank together with the shadow rapporteur , Susta .
At the same time , Romania supported the policy of &apos; open doors &apos; , especially in terms of strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I believe that , in addition , everything must be done to counter the consequences of the disaster and to re-establish living conditions .
It is also clear that I am referring not only to accidents at work that often occur but also to dangerous substances used in the working process .
The Council began a detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision establishing a European Refugee Fund in September 2009 .
At this moment , it is important that we take particular account of the isolated and outermost regions , which , with constant obstacles , are currently facing their infrastructure and the destruction of their personal , commercial and agricultural goods , and are often unable to resume their normal activities immediately , especially in regions that are almost entirely dependent on tourism , as the media coverage of potential visitors .
Since the events of 11 September 2001 , we have not seen such lengthy disruption and financial losses in industry and , despite the current financial difficulties , I urge the Member States to stand by plans to support the aviation sector because this sector is not able to cope with further losses .
At the same time , we have to acknowledge that we have to take more risk .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congolese is dreadful .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small language and perhaps a report .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You might want something to do - you might want it very strongly - but you have to see reality .
Consumer organisations are in all Member States in favour of binding measures for the judicial enforcement of collective redress , coupling with other options , such as the mechanism for alternative dispute resolution ( fund dissolution , ADR ) .
The problem is not with the Turks in Cyprus , as many people are saying .
I would like to ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin without having to travel long , demanding to the consumer .
That is what we have to do .
I am really interested , ladies and gentlemen , in where the human rights activists have disappeared , who , like us , are happy with the West being secular and pluralist , but who shamefully translated into their eyes on the Middle East , which , step by step , will become the exclusive territory of a single religion .
This is under way and we are in discussion with the authorities of the countries concerned .
Mr President , the bankers who are squandering our money , Mr Schulz , are just as irresponsible are politicians bearing the deficit and debt on the younger generations now .
For this reason , I would like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs of each political group .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to deliver .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument of democracy and human rights was a good thing , but it has , in fact , been very cooperative .
We must try to ensure that the recommended programmes provide as much support as possible to the reforms carried out by these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that each Member State maintains its national contact point , which provides patients with all the necessary information , i.e. about the availability of healthcare , procedures and the required documentation .
Previously , all events in the Soviet Union were taken as an ideological investigation and today we are already discussing trade on the terms of full individual freedom .
Regardless of whether or not the pension fund is considered as a public fund , the report is about a very specific matter , namely that Parliament has first established that it does not demand legal action to compensate for the deficit of its own budget and that , on the other hand , the losses will not be offset .
Surely their face has been the most expensive since the face of St Heléna , which has launched thousands of boats .
Support to distort competition will undermine the future of the European car industry and will have a negative impact on employment and technological progress .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , we should bear in mind a few things in the forthcoming debate .
We have already heard from several of my fellow Members that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with the reverse voting mechanism .
I think it is very important that we remember what is actually at stake .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To express our solidarity with the campaign to eliminate this barbaric ritualem , I propose that we all set out today a rose-and-mirror , our opposition to these practices , be a sign of protest .
There is a lack of democratic control because , while national governments hide behind the Commission and Trojka in the most fundamental measures , the Commission relies on these matters to national governments .
New Multiannual Financial Framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After the Commission &apos;s threat of prosecuting Sweden before the European Court of Justice , we have now begun to authorise the December BDE .
For us who represent rural constituencies and for those in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , it is clear to those in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the situation in which many livestock farmers find themselves is simply untenable .
The contributors deserve transparent information , which is both public and easy to access .
I think we should support the Chinese people in creating a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms in the vote , because I believe that we must be demanding and ambitious in improving budgetary discipline in Europe , thus protecting our future .
It is also important that the organiser of this initiative ( social or non-governmental organisations ) - although not necessarily having to table a legislative proposal - clearly and clearly sets out the purpose and purpose of the initiative .
In Latvia , there is a city , Daugughan pilots , where more than 90 % of the population is Russian-speaking .
I would like to use this opportunity to welcome the apology made by Prime Minister Jan Fischer and the renewed motion by the government of the Czech Republic to take action from 31 December 2009 to ensure that such violations do not happen again .
I welcomed this report , as GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers worldwide .
The effects of globalisation are currently being shaken fully by the financial and economic crisis , and our moderate response to this is the adjustment of the EGF &apos;s financing criteria .
This resolution takes note of the declaration of Kosovo &apos;s independence on 17 February 2008 , which was recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to cooperate in the common approach , bearing in mind the planned accession of Kosovo to the EU .
Compared with the other two institutions , Parliament still considers it a pioneering issue when it comes to transparency , so this is not , for me , a major issue , because we are more open than any national parliament as regards access to documents and transparency in the activities of members of the European Parliament .
The Italian Minister for Reform , Umberto Bossi , was a domestic political step .
We should take news from my country , the Institute for Human Rights in Aturtias , much more seriously .
I am voting in favour of the Casini report .
I find it highly regrettable to adopt the resolution on the ban on pigmeat and cattle ruin .
That is why I decided to abstain on this text and to follow the ongoing investigation very closely .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data are not entirely appropriate for identifying measures to punish Member States where the highest levels of irregularities and fraud are the highest .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the 5th European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16 : 25 p.m. )
More importantly , the most effective way to improve the energy efficiency of buildings is to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors not included in the emissions trading scheme by 20 % .
As regards the second question , I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware that the handling of antibiotics requires a multidisciplinary approach .
Yesterday &apos;s trialogue gives us a great deal of hope .
It is estimated that , in the case of a 27 % annual growth rate , this figure could reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis for this proposal needs to be revised , so that the text does not take the form of a Council decision , but of a regulation .
Many people are asking me what ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because EU financial support will help people who are victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and to flee the recession .
Since the Internet is the most important tool for creating better opportunities , development and knowledge for citizens in the field of culture , especially by broadcasting audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in both the radio spectrum and software development and innovation .
Above all , there are also concerns about the cultural and geographical differences in Turkey and Europe , as well as the problems with which the accession of a country with which more than 80 million inhabitants live in neighbouring countries , and these factors confirm my firm belief that it would not be appropriate for Turkey to join Europe , a Europe of which , above all , is based on Christian spirit .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests in the Chamber )
This means that we are working against the environment and consumer safety , as equipment that is obsolete , high-energy and potentially hazardous will be put back on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate with great expectations .
I wanted to record my thanks to the mayor of Baling , Mr Dr Reitemann , and the local council for allowing memory to be kept to be respected before the lives of these young people .
Thirdly , my great request to Mrs Kroes is that if we want to be proud of this great steering project in the future , it will speed up digitisation in the Member States .
Anyone who has already experienced and seen the effects of the environmental disaster caused by the failure of the major technology in mining and the toxic cyanide contamination spill in order to ensure similar consequences for the timber of the River Tisa in Hungary and the Danube bulldoze in Bulgaria will never happen in the European Union .
That is the responsibility of all of us : the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and property : the fundamental freedom of movement , as you said , is right to cross the separatist borders .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when it recommends rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we have had the courage to convene the summit to invite the social partners to work with them on this issue in the long term ( in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague ) and to try to reach conclusions that will be good for the June Council .
In fact , the European Parliament established a good basis at first reading for the correct application of the rules of cross-border healthcare in the Member States , so that patients , in justified cases , and without burdening the rules set out and the courts , will also be able to take advantage of the patient or hospital care they need in another Member State .
That is also what the Barnier report proposed , but we have not reached an agreement so far .
There is no time to waste .
By distorting the reality , another attempt by the European Parliament to interfere in Venezuela by another grouping attempt to distort the reality .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a contentious document containing the opinion of the various types of users on this subject , and I will come back to the outcome of this public consultation shortly .
Thank you for your participation .
I would add that if a person is detained , then the European Convention on Human Rights also provides for this .
