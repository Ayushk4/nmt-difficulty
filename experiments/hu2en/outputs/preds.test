It is absolutely clear.
Today, after the events in Georgia, and when Russia recognised the independence of the Abkhazian and South Osetian crops, Russia's readiness to create a common security zone with the European Union seems increasingly distant, and the positions of the parties on the issue of Kosovo and the common neighbourhood vary much more than ever.
We have set up a common European Union standard in the area of minority rights, and that would certainly be necessary.
However, surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness divergences must, in particular, be ensured for euro area Member States, since there is a greater risk of economic and financial transfer in euro area Member States; less market discipline; no exchange rate risk; and adjustment is more difficult and costly for the whole euro area.

For it to be a real success, we must all - Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the European Central Bank - join forces together to find a way forward.

Members of the European Parliament have said'no' to the flexible response and'no' to the unacceptable pressure that France is exerting on the top number of democratic bodies on the continent of Europe!

The new logic of organising the economy, based on green'New Deal', i.e. environmentally tech innovation and supporting international capital markets, is an essential building block for an increasing number of economic recovery programmes, including in the EU.
The bilateral agreements that some Member States have concluded on the implementation of certain projects, such as' Nord Stream', have not only caused distrust in environmental matters, but also in the context of the principles of solidarity and therefore require transparency in this area.
I think that is a good and important thing.
We are all aware that a fundamental change of direction is required in the current policy, which is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy.
However, what is important now is for the Commission and the Member States to negotiate hard in Copenhagen.
My second point concerns the future of multilateralism, a concept which has often been declared in this House.

So when Mr Lambsdorff indicated that the whole package had only one concept and that reverse majority voting, I do not think that is the case.
It has had to rise to major challenges: for example, the transition from the Treaty of Nice to the legal system of the Treaty of Lisbon and the preparation of the multiannual work programme for the next five years for the area of freedom, security and justice.
I believe that we have a currency that is really solid and also on an historic scale.
The real functioning of the rule of law is the basis of everything that we are going to do in the country, and this also applies, of course, to the legal system and extremely important political and constitutional reform.
The European Parliament and the European Union must address the problems of operational needs and the harmonisation of expenditure within a framework.
We know that.
This measure does not deal with the proper evaluation of products before their market and does not mention in any way the risks of GMOs placing on the market.
You are right to say that, first of all, we must prevent pharmaceuticals from gaining a pharmaceutical chain and that is the crucial point I would like to make.
It is up to the Member States to decide whether or not drug beneficiaries should be prosecuted, and the EU does not want to depart the judiciary.

I agree with the rapporteur when he states that, in order to achieve the aims of this directive, it is essential to ensure that the directives on unfair commercial practices and misleading and comparative advertising are properly transposed, implemented and enforced, in particular, because of the different methods of application and enforcement in the Member States, the complexity of certain legal concepts contained in the directives, unfair commercial practices and the very quality of application of the directive and the directive.

As bluetongue has a very serious impact on livestock farms, all measures promoting good practice in vaccination must be taken so that farmers do not lose animals, as it causes serious damage and can destroy an economy.

Mr President, one of the changes that the Prime Minister spoke about this morning is the Citizens' Initiative.
President-in-Office of the Council. - At the conference in Pozna≈Ñ in December 2008, an agreement was reached on the 2009 work programme, which clearly identified the steps to be taken for the Copenhagen climate conference to be held in December 2009.
The final version of the draft agenda for this sitting drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.

In my country, Estonia, we have not yet used this fund and, when I asked why it was not, I was told that the conditions were too stringent and that the limit that was 1000 people up to now could not be met.
I believe that together, we will be able to set up the principles governing and facilitating future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism.
Mr President, it is very arrogant to see the increasing incidence of vicious, violent attacks on Christians and their communities.
We are putting forward proposals on the strength of the Stability and Growth Pact and on the detailed examination of developments in debt; improving economic governance in the euro area by the Euro Group; establishing a robust and credible mechanism for preventing and settling excessive deficits in the euro area, which could also include the creation of a European monetary fund.
Another problem is the administrative cost involved with subcontracting undertakings.
We do not want there to be a'look forward' and a new Delaware in the European Union where companies can circumvent this type of legislation.
Firstly, the EU budget for 2011 has specific priorities, which must be strengthened in the light of the economic problems that have arisen throughout Europe as a result of the structural crisis of recent years.
We need to be in a situation which allows us to safeguard farmers' incomes and to develop market mechanisms in order to prevent and ward price price price price volatility similar to the current one.
We need more employment, we need a better gender balance and we need more education.
This proposal complements the existing Community legal framework in which non-discrimination on grounds of religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation applies only to employment, employment and vocational education.
(The President cut off and ordered the speaker)
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has caused a huge disaster: radioactive contamination has also affected people who were close to the plant and who suffered injuries.
We need to evaluate and fully understand what is in our hands, what the effects are perhaps lacking and where overlaps are, so that we can propose new and more considered measures.
We have all been the cause, and that is our joint responsibility, so everybody would play their part in resolving the crisis.
However, this comprehensive approach has already been mentioned earlier.
This is the most important third stage in 2010 and, within this framework, there will be high-level meetings and negotiations with government ministers on a number of important issues that the Commissioner and the Minister have already mentioned, such as the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation in the world.
I also think that the number of errors and misjudgments is relatively low - albeit too many.
(CS) This inevitable proposal that we are debating today for an amendment to the Late Payments Directive is definitely better than the original proposal.
(Applause)

Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes

We have adopted this resolution with the clear aim of expressing that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are doing their utmost to support the people of Haiti in rebuilding the infrastructure, reforming communities and facilitating the fate of survivors.

Written statements (Rule 149)
Many EU Member States are jointly responsible for Guant√°namo, for example, because of the fact that flight permits have been granted to illegal shipments.
According to this programme, trade policy will continue to be a very important tool for meeting the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and for promoting economic growth, job creation and the happiness of all European citizens.

Unfortunately, then, you realise that, behind many of the measures, there is a clear will to hide behind our institutions to still discover irresponsibility, which is something that does not clearly contribute legislation.
We would also like to add a few major political aspects to this because, as has already been said, we are talking here about a compartmentality that, if not in a limited form, has introduced quotas for the opposition, but is also conducted by a cross-party policy.
There is a problem with the appointment of the additional 18 MEPs, as some Member States have not planned a procedure for this, but we have chosen that representation is the most important issue that this directive should govern us and that this Parliament should have a balanced representation as soon as possible.
As has already been said here, rational land use, economies and social progress in harmonious relationships with nature and enhanced cohesion within the European Union are all fundamental factors for preventing disasters.

We can talk about 2020, but there are also major problems today: the euro area and Greece.
Information and communication technology (ICT) represents an important sector, mainly because of the weight of the European economy: it employs 7% of the workforce - the European workforce - and 6% of GDP, such as the European economy and a large proportion of the European productive and labour force.
I believe that a lot of initiatives will be submitted to the Commission requesting'more Europe', and the Commission will definitely react with enthusiasm.
Since we are not shouldering responsibility and standing firm, we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier: we must be aware that, by 2020 - and we set this on the digital agenda - all Europeans must be given the opportunity to do things through the opportunities of the spectrum.
Organisations of this kind build their power to respond to people's everyday needs and then consolidate their powers using terror.

The protocol allows the Union to secure EUR 682 500 per year in support of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, of which EUR 227 500 is channelled towards support for S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe's fisheries policy - I think this is a good measure.
We will monitor the future implementation.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament's efforts in this area more seriously, although it is rather sad and worrying that the Council representative is no longer here.
After all, if we, as Europeans, play an active role in this matter, then it is very important that we continue to play this active role.

This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential, even if it concerns only 1% of national health budgets, because, apart from the figures, we should focus on the strength of the symbol, which is that all European citizens have legally given the right to receive treatment abroad and to provide reimbursement for the treatment they receive and receive adequate information.
However, as a form of primary prevention, I call - as a fundamental factor in improving health - for the implementation of measures to promote healthy living.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that we need binding regulations at EU level in this area, as there are different legislation in the Member States, and Member States often have only limited powers to enforce the provisions of international law on violence against women.

Due to the adoption of Amendment 43, Article 54 cannot become the object, because in Amendment 54 there are other issues to which Amendment 43 does not cover.

Mr President, unfortunately, in addition to the big figures - the United States, China, India and Brazil - there was not a European giant presence in the Copenhagen negotiations.

rapporteur. - Madam President, I was somewhat unexpected about this situation, as I did not see today the entire time change, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address this House on one of the important issues relating to the industry of financial services, that is, insurance and maintenance, which we have dealt with in the Solvency II report and the way in which we have finally been able to put on the table to the European Parliament in order to be very solid in the interests of the regulation.

(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following point: it is very surprising that, while Albania's growth indicators have been steadily rising, where growth has been more than 2% in 2010 and is expected to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is not improving, but is getting worse.
Human trafficking is still a serious problem within the European Union.

The Serbian authorities must do their utmost to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy work properly in the country and that there is a constant reduction in corruption in Serbia and a severe punishment for people who have returned to their positions of office.
In conclusion, the Europe that we are fighting for - a Europe of justice, social development, economic and social cohesion, cooperation between sovereign states on an equal footing - is a long way from the line proposed by the new Commission.
It is important, from the point of view of democracy and legitimacy, for us to know to our citizens what the EU is doing.
We Germans would not be worthy of our national unity if we were not to see it as a contribution to European unity, following the historic events that I have just described.

Unfortunately, the important amendments from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have been rejected and, as a result, the initiatives cannot be signed by EU residents who are non-citizens, blocking the equal participation of residents of this Member State, regardless of nationality, nor by guaranteeing that signatures are the same as identification number of signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent committee of local and international legal experts, which would carry out investigations and prosecutions on the basis of acts of violence following the objectionable elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and the world that we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan.

It could also effectively serve to improve regional policies by establishing guidance for public and private organisations and creating a system of training and mobility for the practical application of multi-level governance policies.
I hope that our Spanish and Italian fellow Members will take part in it, but we cannot postpone it any longer because the whole world is dealing with the innovation market.

It is therefore extremely important to adopt measures which will strengthen the guarantees guaranteeing transparency and independence of impact assessments, as this would increase the facility's role in the legislative process and ensure the quality and adequacy of the activities of EU institutions.
My second point is that the strategy should also strengthen the Union's internal cohesion and convergence.
However, I would add that the Commission has not gone in this direction, as its proposal, through the regulation adopted by Parliament, focuses on the reform of the current system of private agencies and on the very stringent consolidation of the transparency requirement in their rating work in order to avoid conflicts of interests and fairness.

We must cooperate with the major consumer countries, such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan, establish a global alert system and record illegal logging and the use of the Internet and the appropriate UN bodies, using the most up-to-date satellite technologies.

I, too, wanted to ask a question about the gender balance in the Commission, so may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the appointment of Cathy Ashton.

This system is based on real policies and guidelines, and now, Mr Michel, is also at the forefront, as well as on liberal rhetoric, and these have led to the current situation that is marked by: support for the agri-industrial model in line with the interests of the big industrialists in the food sector and, consequently, the deterioration of agriculture standards worldwide; phenomena that have lasted as many as possible in the agricultural sector as 70% of small farms as possible.
This is because farmers receive less money than production costs and the CAP must enable us to solve this problem.
I urge the Commission once again to continue to exert pressure in its relations with the government in order to comply with the promise until it is included in the Congolese code.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand Parliament's great interest in the measures taken in the European Union and outside it to address the challenges faced by some Member States in relation to their budgets.
We sympathise with the aspirations of nations that want a better life, rights and a better future for themselves.
You can even count on the support of Irish Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).

The day when we are successfully freed from poverty, the ghost of communism will disappear forever.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the revision of horizontal cooperation rules - B7-0565/2010).
That is why they fought together, whether in a blue light or in an orange way.
I believe that this procedure and the strengthening of EU food security will give greater clarity to Member States and third countries which export meat preparations to the EU.
In view of this, compliance with the Mercosur Convention appears to be bold, especially as the Swedish Food and Technological Institute has shown that the coal footprint of Brazilian beef could be between 35 and 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
For this reason, the following text must be inserted by the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1 (b) of the amending regulation:'The same reference rate must be applied in the annual revision of the value of the charges covered by Article 4a, 4b and 63 (if not the euro'.
The Irish Government has today called for European solidarity, and rightly so, it has received solidarity.
Look at Ireland, a country that has been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union has been protected from an even greater crisis.
Mr Klaus is holding up from German demands for seudo-building and I think, given the statements made by the German politicians on this issue, that his fear is entirely justified.
an increase in funding from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund and more financial support for technical activities linked to project development and implementation;
If we do not create something to remind the Member States that economically irrational policies have serious consequences, we will not achieve nowhere.
We must further expand and advertising activities for tackling climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always on such complex issues, my background has helped me greatly: Bernadte Vergnaud, Cristian Bu≈üoi and Heide R√ºhle.
Indeed, freedom of the press and of the media in Russia is a major problem.
Similarly, the Member States will also decide whether or not to sign up to the Council of Europe's two main documents, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Minorities and Regional Languages.
For this reason, it is a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange views on issues of interest to all of us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, so that people in work can be protected and given a certain amount of support, so that they do not lose their jobs and then can be retrained and trained in one or two years' time, so that they can find new jobs or keep their current jobs.
Madam President, the intention of our questions is to highlight the benefits that our citizens can expect from this package of measures and what we can offer them in this package.
I voted in favour of this report because it adds some substantial improvements to the text of the European Commission, especially as regards the data protection of private individuals.
In addition, we have carried out a review of the unused funds for 2009, with a total of EUR 1.9 billion available for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in the category II category.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for this clear message.
We can see something there, too, and we can also see the ambition to apply a holistic approach, which was not as we thought, but which is at least moving in the right direction.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which, at times, was a little tougher than the pleasing, as well as the Council, where we tried to find sensible solutions at late midnight and during several trialogues, because they also adopted the reasonable compromise we reached an hour ago.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with the organisation Eurocontrol after the meeting of the Committee on Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010, established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination.
At the same time, it should be remembered that the problem, in this case illegal logging, is, in itself, rarely based on the conditions for illegal trade in timber.
I come from a region in Portugal, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very significant, has gone to regions which are socially sufficiently vulnerable and in which it would be essential to maintain the quota system beyond 2015.

In some cases, they are really so good that they should be considered.
(SV) Mr President, although Iceland is a small nation with a population of around 3000 inhabitants, it is a great nation.
Mr President, MEPs must play a significant role in investigating health claims decisions.
We therefore say'yes' to the Nabucco project, but equally resolute'yes' to our decision to support our government's efforts to ensure that diversification of supplies guarantees the well-being of our people.
Political parties can be banned; there is corruption in the legal system; there is a violation of human rights; freedom of expression and freedom of association do not exist in the way that Britain or other European states do.
It is also quite clear that we need a different energy mix composed of energy sources from energy sources based on the widest possible basis, because this will stabilise the energy situation and, by extension, will ensure that individual nations and Europe are also able to diversify.
However, I have considerable doubts when Parliament refers to international law in its condemnation of certain reckless practices, while the legal basis for this is far from clear.
By voting in favour of the motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic uprisings they have begun.
It also calls on Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies, such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty, and to report back on a regular basis on their activities to address this issue.
If the Hungarian Parliament now adopts a piece of legislation and decides that this legislation can only be amended by a two-thirds majority later, it is clear that it will not be easy to amend this legislation after the next elections.

We voted in plenary today on the proposal for harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
We are facing another major problem with a new feeling of mutual confidence.
This year, we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million for the EEAS, but the actual costs will only be found after the first year of operation when all reports containing expenditure on EEAS activities come before the European Parliament.
My question relates to Pakistan, whose chronic instability, as we all know, is one of the factors in the entire region and Afghanistan's crisis.
Of course, we must not forget the natural biodiversity differences that exist between men and women.
We must also remember these elements in relation to the proposal to earmarking the revenue generated by infrastructure and external costs.
(HU) I welcome the proposal in this directive that patients' rights, the end of the unexpected waiting lists and the problem of professionals who do not exist in their own country.

Last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency with a shadow rapporteur during the committee meeting.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran as I, too, am concerned about the human rights situation there, particularly with regard to freedom of association, freedom of expression and of information, and with sympathy for the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.
In particular, it will be very important for funds to be launched rapidly.
One thing is to create such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens in order to allow them to make full use of the opportunities it offers.
Apart from increasing the competitiveness of Canadian and European markets, the agreement also makes them safer, as regulators and enforcement authorities are cooperating more and more intensively in all areas of certification, control and enforcement, in order to guarantee the greatest safety for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a meaningful debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
In addition, it is a private aspect that not only increases the image that Europe represents for the world, but also promotes European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the proposal we are discussing today is to amend the legislation approved in 2004, which has improved and harmonised the safety rules for the protection of EU citizens, passports and travel documents against fraudulent use, while simultaneously introducing elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, a temporary institutional framework must be established for the purpose of the decision enforcement mechanism.
To make a positive point, we have recently concluded some very good agreements, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that the approach to current constructive cooperation with the European Union is much more effective than repeated attempts to write history.
It seems strange that, to this day, the European Commission has not found any good arguments or time to influence the Latvian Government in order to put an end to linguistic discrimination.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to switch all forms of aid to the Pakistani Government to the urgent elimination of the disastrous discrimination against religious minorities in the country.
This will be an effective tool for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
That is also acceptable and legitimate, and we fought for ourselves.
It is clear, rather than ever, that financial institutions need a ceasefire and reassess their approach.
Our common objective is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we have also been able to achieve this in committee.
The main objective of encouraging trade is to increase the competitiveness of 48 states at home and at international level.
Even if we accept the rationale of internalising external costs as a starting point, it is ultimately untenable that, in order to reduce traffic congestion, heavy goods vehicles are penalised only, and not the general cars, just as the good old'polluter pays' principle is clearly discriminated against.
I was very encouraged by understanding and support in plenary.
Furthermore, if we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The primary objective of the governments of the European Union and of the Member States, whether on the right or in the centre-left, is to ensure the continuous profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers throughout the European Union.

However, the recast, codification, has a very important aspect, which relates to the whole transformation of the TEN-T networks in the next decade.
(LT) Mr President, the European Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial to the Ukrainian people, but let us not forget that it is also important for the citizens of the European Union, because Ukraine is an important partner, especially in the realisation of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which covers Eastern Europe.
Therefore, the Commission must speak out strongly.
We cannot interfere in an issue where the US Government has exclusive competence.
Forest management managers earn very little - if they are paid at all - in order to ensure these hidden functions, which many people are taking on a natural basis.
It should also be said that the list of outstanding problems is growing rather than falling.
With regard to Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would like to ask that the Council and the Commission, represented by Baroness Ashton in a person, act urgently on three issues.
There are large dealers whose presence on the market of certain Member States is very strong, but there are many small dealers that are more pleased with our current proposal than the regulation in force since 2002, because they see that certain aspects that have not been in the intention of the legislator in 2002 have not served their interests but rather made it difficult for them to compete with the major dealers.
It must build a'EU regional policy partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which was launched by the Committee on Development when adopting the report of April 2007.
During the years, the context and ambitions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), especially after the historic enlargement of 2004, have changed profoundly.

I strongly support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's draft has been amended in accordance with the report that we are now voting on, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

All forms of medical assistance fall within the scope of the treaty that created the European Union, irrespective of their distinctive characteristics.
I would like to draw the House's attention to something that is very important: in the recent study by the European Kariological Society, it was reiterated that this method was greatly restricted by very few women taking part in clinical studies.
It is not the idea that investment agreements should be used to achieve social objectives, but at the same time that investment agreements should not prevent us from achieving our social and environmental objectives.
Greater emphasis must be placed on the recovery of organic waste, especially in this largely agricultural region, the data must be monitored and the establishment of a system for exchanging best practices.
There is a totally incomprehensible piece of legislation which states that Orthodox priests, bishops and Patriarcos must be Turkish citizens.
One of the most important points in Parliament's position is that it focuses attention on the fragmentation of measures, which may result in incompatibility, not only in the codes of legislation, but especially in their implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured that the European Union will accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least, the issue of the digital Single Market has finally been included among the EU's priorities.
This would be a major step towards transparency, public and clarity in European processes.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because it is certainly worth discussing this issue.
Does the European Union have to offer this economic development model to Europeans?
OK, I will not allow the speakers to go over time, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important for us.
We want an appropriate strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, which will finally improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region after implementation.
This is a real achievement, given that, apart from deepening the legal basis, the directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and provides a whole range of new opportunities for access to better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors is unable to provide acceptable evidence of the legitimate and regular use of the EU budget and, as a contractor to the European Commission in 2002, I was extremely concerned that taxpayers' money was not properly monitored.
For me, this is a huge challenge and also a great honour.
If we are honest, then we have to acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and that our per capita emissions are still multiplied, for example, to similar Chinese or Indian data.
I am sure that we will then have a constructive dialogue.
We regret that, like Europol, attempts to preserve fundamental freedoms have been undergone in the face of haste.
I agree with the Commission's proposal to introduce a simpler use method for the European Social Fund's reserves, to ensure that it can respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties facing Europe.
Frankly, I would have preferred to have voted against the Commission in view of the unseen Commissioners, but I trust the nominated candidates, such as the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - Mr Kirkhope, but there are actually 26 other Member States outside the European Union, so you will understand that although we are very sensitive to the concerns that you mentioned, I have other legitimate concerns.
I believe that we should be careful to maintain the neutrality of EU humanitarian aid even if this is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
It also gives new points, as Parliament has already said, to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, for example, to evaluate the investigation carried out by all parties and to report to Parliament, reminding us that the EU and the Member States are demanding full control of the investigations and to express concern over the non-governmental measures that have been taken, including those under pressure from the Goldstone report and beyond it.
I also hope that the resolution will help to prevent the disappearance of fish species.
I hope that you will not provoke my questions, as I would just like to help you consider it.
I am always keen to be available and present to Parliament our results - and I hope I have the opportunity to do so - but we also need to prove what we have found.
This result strengthens the Union's negotiating position in international trade negotiations, especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations on the World Trade Organisation.
If Europe speaks with one voice, the United States of America will also embrace this objective.
I am therefore in favour of prices for tobacco growers in Europe, at least as long as people in Europe are going to smoke.
When we look at the initiatives of the various Member States, it is becoming clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) that is independent of European structural policy.
The number of new infections is still far beyond the scope of treatment and in 2009, two thirds of those who need treatment were not yet given, which means that 10 million people did not have the necessary effective treatment.
Indeed, if we respect human dignity, we see minorities in absolutely no negative light.
I welcome the Commission's proposals on simplifying this fund.
All EU institutions must ensure in the future that the cost framework is created so that individuals and businesses can overcome difficult economic times and also plan for recovery.
The quickest way to pull up, which is much more effective and practical than any top-down measure, is to support citizens' initiatives, cultural organisations and regional institutions.
For anyone who is convinced that the Treaty will strengthen the European Union, to this day, fight against the Treaty, I say: those fighting the Treaty are actually our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents will be strengthened.

The TEN-T meeting will shortly be held, where the Commission will stand up for the development of the network of alternative means of transport.

This morning, Mr Madlener was the first to take the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community.

Indeed, I would remind this House that, according to recent referendums, more than 20 million people are still unemployed in the European Union - and this figure is likely to be 25 million now - which means that more asylum seekers will actually be subjected to collective suicide.
Sanctions must be applied by the Commission, not by the finance ministers.
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support.

I have shown particular interest in the issue of children's rights in the context of foreign affairs.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, for ten years now, the European Union has been trying to equip itself with legislation in the field of economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a useful tool for eliminating national administrative and technical barriers to the placing of construction products on the market in the European Union and for continuing to create a single market for the sector.
I believe that, if we really want to meet our foreign policy objectives set out in the treaties, we still have a long way to go before we can send back illegally staying migrants to Libya.

The recent elected new UK government has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific agricultural measures for the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand with positive results for us, both in terms of environmental protection and in creating new jobs.
There are countries that do not make full use of the ESF allocated to them and 30% or 40% remain.
However, this beggars me with curiosity - even if the Commissioner said he had to publish information and publish them, and he has a duty to publish them - why this was not known, for example.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal to have an effective information campaign that would draw attention to the points of single contact.
in writing. - (DE) It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and to make it compulsory to implement economic policy objectives.

I hope - and I hope - that your votes will form the basis of the agreement.
Firstly, I regret the fact that the Commissioner's colleague, Mr McCreevy, is not here - I think he might have started again on the horse race!
You may not know about it, but there are many animal attempts to justify this type of claim, for example.
One thing, Commissioner, is a little dubious for me, and that is that of the CARS 21 and the sector's significant influence on the process that we are embarking on here.
We do not agree with that.
In 2010, the amount of EU assistance earmarked for supporting democracy and good governance in Moldova for the period 2007-2013 amounts to more than EUR 50 million.
Of course, we cannot understand how it is that an illegal worker is located and someone who accepts the cost of his or her residence and survival will ultimately be punished.

Finally, High Representative, you will visit the Middle East.
What is even more serious is that the US Congress was annoying by adopting the American Service-Members Act after the establishment of the International Criminal Court in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly outline that the report contains amendments which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following the resolution adopted during the plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal to authorise the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption, including in the case of prior anti-microtreatment.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my profound regret at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, as well as my concern for the four more Cuban prisoners and opposition activists who began hunger strike in protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme for freedom, security and justice (2010-2014).
Do our motto not waste one cent!
The Union and, in particular, the countries around the sea, have always been at the forefront of humanitarian aid for the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity with the people living in such problematic conditions is essential.
Often, employees themselves are isolated, and accession to trade unions is very difficult in this situation.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, as it currently stands, Mrs Guillaume's report, even if some amendments have helped to improve, in fact encourages people to misuse this procedure and to prevent the relevant services, thus depriving those who really need their case to be examined quickly.
It is our responsibility to do our best and I would like to thank Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their excellent work, which has benefited all of us.
We have indeed taken a huge programme throughout which there were some important, important reports.

The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, with regard to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of the individual proposals, I should like to ask whether a preliminary study can be carried out in this area, based, among other things, on the specific features of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the area, so that there are criteria that each country has to take into account and be fulfilled in planning from the outset.
We also need to take a special look at the situation of Roma women, who suffer particularly from the problems of poverty, the difficulties of accessing housing, discrimination and violence; and we also need to look at the problem of Roma young people, because in this case, the lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult to find a job in the current economic crisis.
I was pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aims to extend its powers in the housing sector in order to help marginalised communities in Member States.
It is a reminder to all politicians that, in order to achieve effective freedom of the press, public bodies must play a role: they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and promote its development.
Mr President, I believe that the European Union has become too large, that it brings together too many cultures, and I simply do not trust this system, which I think will be even worse.
It is a little early to announce the results of the analysis and, as the Member will be aware, all steps in the process require unanimous decision by the Council.
It is important to note that the prospect of EU integration for the Balkan countries is the strongest incentive for implementing the necessary reforms and contributing to regional stability.
At this time when advertising has an even greater role to play, it is essential to lay down criteria allowing consumers and patients to be fully informed and secure in terms of the impact of medicines.
Neil Armitt's words would be a small step for European funds, but a huge leap for the European economy.
Thirdly, the security gaps that several of you have repeatedly stated will simply not exist if we do not vote on the interim agreement.
Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and electronic commerce in recent years has increased the supply of online games and more and more cross-border issues that continue to be unresolved.
Anyone who makes the decisions in this area must have equal access to suitable information on the country of origin of the asylum seeker and the organs authorised to hear appeals, as do asylum seekers.
So, after so many years, I can assess how important it was to build the only multi-ethnic parliament in the world, elected by universal suffrage.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence, and that EUR 200 billion must be spent better than we have done in the past.
Together, we have achieved a change.
We will also work on services of general interest in this legislation.
I can therefore propose, for example, that we present Mr Almunia, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who was quite critical of some countries during his term of office and then raised the Greek problem.
In this regard, reforms in Turkey are very much needed.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, such as Portugal and Spain, and we must therefore also now grant this assistance to Lithuania.

This fund also plays a significant role in the education of workers, professional training for life, improving job opportunities and involving workers in the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes

This has happened now and I supported the proposal in the vote.
Only one answer can be given to this: growth.
