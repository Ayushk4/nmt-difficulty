Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.

President of the Commission. - Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis.
The conclusions in the report being debated in the European Parliament on Wednesday highlight the fact that agricultural products from third countries suffer far more damage to the environment than internal production, which tightens up stricter rules for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, thereby helping to combat climate change.
It is difficult to accept, in fact, that the countries receiving these funds cannot use them.
Dates for next sittings: see Minutes
Maritime institutions in Member States need to cooperate more closely to harmonise their training programmes, and offer opportunities for trained work experience and exchanges with European maritime companies.
The next item is the Commission statement on the following of storm Xynthia in Europe.
We can see that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers.
We need to strengthen Frontex more decisively, and the EU must remind the Member States of their responsibility.
I would like to mention one more point which has been raised so far only by Commissioner Almunia.
The areas where the effects of climate change are particularly felt are the following: water supply, agriculture, energy, forestry and biodiversity and, last but not least, public health.
Furthermore, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my saddened at the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a member of the magistrate following last week's terrorist attacks.
The other thing you are doing, Mr Piebalgs.
However, it is encouraging that, as a result of the protests by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education against and concerns about the degradation of education and training policies, at a time when unemployment is increasing and many Member States of the European Union are experiencing, the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments, which I voted in favour of, and these amendments increase the resources originally provided for in Article 1502, for, for example, 202.
There was a minority government with a completely different party political composition, and no one found this a coup d'état.
The fact that we, as an international society, looked at the situation undecided in Abyei's referendum is, in fact, very irresponsible and it is a recipe for renewed war.
The case of Romanian handballer Marian Cozma, who was brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community, shows once again that crime knows no borders and that denial of the problems of this community is counterproductive.
There must be a sound European food policy.
The Treaty of Lisbon should introduce a new political model in Europe, and this applies both to the need to mobilise all Member States jointly in order to achieve the best possible result, and to work on joint strategies and operations which must make Europe's political union, the founding fathers dry.
That is what we are submitting to you.
We all and Hungary have always been in favour of the single market from the outset.
The unavoidable climate change is forcing society and the European Union's economy to adapt to the new reality.
The individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and assist in finding socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions.
It has been a wonderful character of three years, and, as is usually the case with very short character, I am pleased to see that it is coming to an end.
It is essential for the constant vigilance and support for NATO to be maintained, especially in the current situation in Afghanistan.
It is time, of course, for something to happen, and we need to get things moving in the right direction.
Common aspects such as reduced VAT rates, derogations from the system, the desirability of a maximum rate and, last but not least, the taxation of supplies within the EU.
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands: we have convinced the highest youth unemployment and our car industry, partly because the European Union has partly funded jobs in Slovakia which have disappeared essential jobs at the Ryton plant.
It is crucial that these young and unexperienced institutions are not intimidated in such a way that they will weaken or undermine important financial sector reform rules.
All of this has taken a long time enough.
We must also provide the opportunity to set up a network of research centres, which can use specialised infrastructure together and exchange useful information and data.
Qimonda meets the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - Mr President, I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office because the situation in third countries, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, is continuously deteriorating.
Mr Severin rightly pointed out the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs a strong US and a strong Europe.
Therefore, I would like to ask the Council what consequences this flow of refugees will have, in other words, what percentage they can be included in the resettlement programme.
I am convinced that the Canadian authorities will do everything possible in the near future to withdraw this visa requirement.
Finally, the case was not discovered by food control companies or the European Food Safety Agency, but by the company itself.
Belarus (debate)
That is why we need to focus our plans on military capability, emphasising'soft power power and prevention', on a new agenda that came to the fore in Munich, because President Obama's policy has been going on for a new era of disarmament negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be able to present my report this evening on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which was approved some time ago by the Committee on Budgets.
In September, the representatives of the French MoDem party in the European Parliament did not vote in favour of the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission, since his previous performance did not give rise to a re-election.
By reorganising our agricultural policy, we can ensure that we pay attention to good animal welfare, and that animals live in conditions that are suited to their species and are strong and healthy, based on the principle that prevention is better than cure.
When the scope of application is extended, we fear that this directive will be the same fate as the previous attempt, when we wanted to dictate origin marking, will be a'made in'.
(SL) Mr President, I agree with the proposal made by other Members that politicians, Member States and the European Union should put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts to achieve economic recovery.
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, both with a deficit deficit of more than 10%, will have to make important adjustments to make their public finances sustainable.
We should not interfere with everything, otherwise the Prime Minister, Mr Leterme, will have to address the new media law in Hungary, and I do not believe that he is responsible.
There is definitely also a lack of freedom of expression in China.
- Report: Cavada
Besides insulting the wine growers who want a quality policy, particularly in the Provence region, it is unacceptable for an by-product to be liberalised from mixing end products and for the misleading reference to rosé colour to be permitted.
Much more remains to be done, however.
This is what is going to happen: a loss of jobs all over Europe and a decline in our food producer capacity.
Let us also remember that, despite these institutional matters, this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is, of course, very much at the heart of the need to tackle climate change and the financial crisis, as well as the concerns in Europe about the need for a policy to create jobs, many important issues that need to be addressed.
However, I would like to stress that we are all well aware that some of the texts needed for this police and judicial cooperation must be given a new basis, which will allow Parliament to exercise its role as colegislator.
I also very much appreciate the fact that the rapporteurs have not joined the whole ethical dimension, an issue which, of course, remains entirely within the responsibility of the Member States.
That is good, because young people decide the future of Europe; on the other hand, we cannot overlook those who have already made their contribution to building Europe.
This means that we are preparing an Economic Recovery Plan that allocates 3.5 billion to the oligarchy of energy revenues and does not yet give a euro to the partners we need for the green change.
Fisheries quotas and conservation management are essential in order to prevent complete overfishing of inland waterways and oceans.
We would have preferred to have given Parliament more resources through efficiency measures and redistribution instead of increasing the total budget.
In addition, with this package, we can show how European institutions can work in such an important area in a responsible, effective and constructive way.
I think that an anti-social approach, as proposed by the Commission in its recast proposal, in other words, the first-instance procedures, will result in us being able to achieve serious economies of scale in the medium term.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is a good report and we managed to reach an agreement at first reading on the Animal by-products Regulation.
We do not want to spend our European jobs on countries that apply less stringent environmental requirements than we do.
All the contributions were useful.
(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating.
They will have to work hard to reach an agreement between the 27 Member States, to express European unity and the will to overcome the crisis and to preserve the essence of European integration.
Madam President, I speak as the Vice-President of the European Parliament for democracy and human rights, and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report.
Tourism is, without doubt, one of the sectors of the economy with the greatest potential for development.
At the time, the money was earmarked for two kinds of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which is carbon capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS) and wind spring in the North Sea.
If it were proposed that money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be allocated to redundant workers in the United Kingdom, we would vote in favour of that allocation, and we would be criticised if we did not do so.
When it comes to the Court's activities, we know that, although the ICC does work in full, it is still in its infancy.
This concerns our neighbours and includes our closest neighbours, such as Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as neighbouring countries, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Like the other Commissioners, I am fully committed to ensuring that the gender dimension is integrated into all policy plans that we present.
These projects will also help eliminate differences in interconnections between systems in the European Union and will allow the best use to be made of the European Union's own energy sources.
This approach is also political, and I think that Europe needs more political, first and foremost, and this is certainly one of Parliament's responsibilities.
Then there is the FIFA's inability to introduce targeted technology, even though other sports have already done so.
After all, we have the opportunity to organise all sorts of training or sessions, with real help in making use of European rural development funds.
Others use the absence of such a policy as an excuse for and justification their bilateral agreements with suppliers, which often fail to meet the requirements of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity.
I am also pleased that Parliament and the Commission have also succeeded in concluding the driving force when planning legislation.
In particular, many Member States have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations under the Pact.
These programmes are designed to enable the EU to respond to the major social challenges facing all Member States, which cannot only tackle (ageing population and health, energy, water and food supply, sustainable development, the fight against climate change, etc.), and to develop the knowledge that our businesses need to innovate and enhance their competitiveness.
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow, I think that this budget is inconsistent on a number of points, and I would like to mention two things that I think are important.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his excellent work.
We will look more closely at the governance issues of the global economy, especially in the areas of financial regulation and timely follow-up to the G20 summit in Pittsburgh.
However, I would like to comment on this in more detail.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist these workers in their reintegration into the labour market.
The underlying problem is that Europeans are no longer prepared to accept the consequences resulting from accession in the area of freedom of establishment.
That is an inconceivable and difficult role.
This is at the top of our priority.
Nevertheless, the European Union's support is essential to ensure the independence of this country.
The Israeli Government is persisting in its colonisations per forced march after it committed war crimes at the start of this year.
Given the results of the evaluations and the visits carried out by teams of experts, it has become clear that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to join the Schengen area.
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has the same five fishing vessels.
increasing the budget for military purposes and developing military capacity, which will contribute to a new arms race;
I would also like to mention the contradiction that exists between the Pakistani Government's commitment to religious freedom and its important role in the organisation of Islamic countries in supporting the Combamation of Defence and Religious Agenda in the United Nations.
I am saying this this this this this afternoon because I think it is really right.
(NL) Mr President, I believe that the compromise that has now been reached by the Council is a good one, because both equal rights and equal treatment are guaranteed.
Under these circumstances, the rapid and coordinated intervention of European governments and institutions must be an absolute necessity, such as the introduction of programmes that allow old cars to be equipped with a proportional reduction in the purchase price of a new, financial aid, et etc.
In my opinion, the proposed legal basis is the right one, but it does not seem to be really compatible with the more than important entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which consolidates the functions and powers that are now divided between the two pillars.
Madam President,'success or failure, that is the question'.
The policy is doomed to failure if the people working in the fishing industry, from those at sea who belong to the traders who sell the fish to the consumer, do not comply with the rules.
This expensive, ineffective prayer club of a Parliament, which is an implicit illusion of a responsible democracy, a shameful deception of the voters who sent us here.
This is a pity, because it is precisely on this issue that we should be united.
We have ended by saying that liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy all our European industries because, in a sense, we cannot shirk that, because the climate issue must be given priority.
A debt burden - and we are now seeing the painful evidence of this - is on the way to economic growth, not only in our European countries, but also in the United States.
In addition, this report helps to better understand and deal with the various air agreements as efficiently as possible, while also specifying the criteria that we must take into account and what aspects we must take into account.
I am going to vote in favour of the telecoms package, but with some hesitation, because I think that the fundamental principle of the liberalisation of the telecom sector that it was in this directive.
(PT) Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office, we are experiencing a crisis as never before.
Its impact will be bigger and its costs will be lower if we are able to coordinate our efforts.
The European Commission is preparing a readmission agreement for and directives to facilitate the granting of European visas to Belarusians.
Let me give a specific example.
Let us look at raising children and schools, for example.
We also do not yet know whether the standards we want to promote in the field of legal trade in timber will apply and operate in a global manner, as already mentioned by some speakers.
The creation of a special committee on the financial, economic and social crisis is a necessity, and it must be entrusted with the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to support sustainable and qualitative growth.
I voted in favour of the rules on vaccination against the bluetongue virus, allowing the use of more effective vaccines and reducing red tape for farmers.
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for strong, integrated policy areas.
With my vote, I wanted to express my deep disappointment at the outcome of the conference, which did not meet citizens' expectations in the strongest possible terms.
Too late payment frequently causes problems both in the internal market and in international trade.
Of course, we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour, which is not questionable by anyone, but we must not let the citizens pull out of the carpet because they are the only ones who can ensure that we can successfully emerge from this crisis.
In the United States, there is an alarm system for this.
One of these cases concerns someone from my own constituency, Andrew Symeou.
We must jointly defend our rights, freedoms and democracy.
Reduced: they asked Europeans to do so when they chose this Parliament, and we must give them that if we want to give them the green vote in five years' time.
The parts of the text that are responsible for the European Council have been discussed and adopted by the Council itself.
During the past 10 years, private consumption per capita has increased by more than 80%.
I believe that it is useful at the moment to focus on the effective thinking of the right methods for implementing existing legislation.
The conclusions of the summit are very vague in this respect.
To this end, the proposal envisages the introduction of uniform eco-exececorial and conservate-ofuel cartels in order to avoid problems with the recognition and translation of other Member States' registered offices and a standard form for notifying documents on the territory of another Member State.
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because they take account of important policies and individual opinions.
The Commission can support Member States in their cooperation at European level through financial programmes.
For example, in the decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003, the Council created the possibility of intergovernmental cooperation for Member States on the prosecution of these crimes, which, fortunately, in some states - we all remember, are still the case of General Pinocde - in law.
Thank you very much.
My vote should not be seen as support for the EU's' subsidy rousel'.
We are increasingly making purchases at distance, and the Internet has changed our habits completely, which is also the result of our increasingly ridiculous lives.
With regard to the provision of information, we are constantly providing information once we receive it.
Finally, I would like to say that training for young generation is the best investment, an investment in lifelong learning.
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere.
These issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final text of the agreement with the Council, and we welcome them.
(Applause from the centre-left)
In this case, it concerned thousands of people, often with small children, who did not have the necessary financial resources.
The procedure for submitting petitions to the Commission under the future provisions of the future treaty is completely different from the procedure for submitting petitions to Parliament.
Human rights must be respected by all the parties in the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area.
We all need to take responsibility.
We have heard that UNESCO has, in any case, protest with the Chinese authorities regarding the impact of the development plans on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar.
in writing. - Mr Schwab has tabled a report aimed at increasing the safety of motor vehicles by introducing stricter safety regulations for car manufacturers.
I therefore voted against this report.
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard, but we have shown that we are capable of acting and we have increased our resilience.
When we talk to outside the House about Parliament's position, for example, with human rights organisations that may be affected by some consequences, and if we cannot reach an agreement (which I do not hope) that individual projects cannot be implemented, then I think there is support and understanding for Parliament's position.
The sessions of this Thursday afternoon are taking an increasingly surrealistic form in this Chamber, both through the leather we see and the issues that we find out and the way they are handled.
In my view, it is still completely unclear whether Moldova will manage to elect a President, and if this is not the case, then the country will inevitably be heading for new elections next year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic and Monetary Union started on 1 January 1999 and 11 EU Member States when the single currency started.
(EL) Madam President, I, too, am in favour of this compromise because it calls into question the shortcomings of democracy that women have been experiencing for years and day in particular when they help their self-employed husband in trade, craftspeople in small and medium-sized enterprises and free professions, without acknowledging their work.
Our political choices are, of course, different and sometimes counterproductive.
I would like to mention that climate justice, because it concerns the relationship between developing and developed countries, the will to make a credible proposal for financing mitigation and adaptation measures and also our willingness to take the lead.
So I would also like to know what the Commission's position is on this issue.
I would like to remind everyone of State aid for the banks that have benefited from the aid, but have not acted in a social way.
I have not only three children, but also a small child, who is only drinking milk.
We are ready to put together technical assistance programmes that are in line with the difficult austerity measures that the Greek Government must apply.
We therefore await the Commission's text.
As you have indicated, we need to constantly update our statistics, and Eurostat is dealing with them.
Sometimes I wonder whether we have learnt enough from the consequences of our actions if we do not choose European solutions to European problems and try to find something more specific, despite having to deal with them collectively.
The e-mails also show that scientists who are sceptical about the hypothesis processes of intercollegial review have been released in order to prevent research errors being made publicly known.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate.
Perhaps the Internet has expose this very dark section of society that we still do not know about.
We know our flaters' surpluses, and in the field of controls, the institutions must know full well that risks are greater in some companies and must therefore be subject to stricter controls.
When working on the revision of the RoHS Directive, our priority was to increase the safety standards for electrical and electronic equipment sold in the European Union.
Particular attention is paid to prevention in schools because young people are young people living in school, the social group that is most at risk of becoming addicted to drugs.
Europe has been successfully expanded, so that, at the end of the Cold War, the reunification of the continent has taken place, and now Europe is being called upon to maintain the achievements achieved and to continue its integration, pending better times.
There are many Members who want answers this evening to be given to them and we want Question Time to be engaged in an orderly manner.
However, the parties concerned knew that it could not be different, that the problems in the dairy sector had to be solved, and hopefully we are now on the way towards finding a solution to some of the problems that some of the sector was facing.
Secondly, while the ECR Group fully acknowledges the need for provisions on pregnancy and parenthood, the ECR has chosen to abstain on such references in the report, as we oppose all forms of family policy at EU level, and this is a matter that the national authorities are talking about.
Last but not least, I think that the next discussions on this issue should concern EUBAM Rafah, how to reinvigorate and possibly expand this mission.
So the Commission is looking into the situation and, if necessary, the Commission will act, but I believe that we cannot stand beyond the Community legal framework and that the Commission will certainly abide by Community legislation.
We all want a European diplomatic service that is not just the sum of the 27 Member States' diplomatic services, so the Financial Regulation and the regulation on the Staff Regulations, which we are discussing today and tomorrow, are vital.
in writing. - Given the persistent differences between men and women with regard to the employment rate, salaries and access to positions of responsibility, I call on all Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC while, at the same time, ensuring that all provisions of the directive are fully and effectively transposed into national law.
I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
I really want the Commissioner to reassure me that no further progress will be made in the coming weeks if the fugitives are not issued.
We will raise this issue in the short term when we discuss the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport.
Today, Wednesday 20 October, the European Parliament adopted the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis.
Attempts are already being made about tax increases in the near future to keep public finances in order.
The time has come to demand the freedom of religion for Christians and supporters of other religions.
In the EU, 31.5% of women work in part-time (30 hours or less per week) compared to 8.3% of men.
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commission and the Minister and I have the impression that the air is in the process of doing so, but there are still many wounds to be wounded.
At that time, only a few of us were able to foreseen the scale of the approaching economic crisis.
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction by making it clear that it is on the side of consumers.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs very much for this sound report.
This policy has become a key element of the economic recovery package, providing added value and supports efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth, while at the same time expressing European solidarity.
Unfortunately, however, we do not yet know where - and or indeed - the Treaty will apply, but clearly we must apply the Treaty that is now in force without hesitation.
However, in my opinion, this situation clearly shows that the agricultural sector is in the process, at least in my region, if farmers have to be out of the queue for years, during the winter months, in an attempt to authorise modest sums and EU aid.
Southern European Member States have done so too late.
This must be achieved through well-considered, sustainable and comprehensive growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.
On behalf of our citizens, we will express our will in a democratic vote, so tomorrow is an important day.
It should be said that housing is an absolute necessity for all, especially in the modern welfare state.
I believe that the definition of political priorities must ensure that these priorities are considered, transparent and democratic.
The aim of this project is to transfer ERTMS.
(HU) In recent months, fears have appeared again in the province of Vojvodina in Northern Serbia, where various nationalities, particularly Hungarians, live.
What we are voting on today is the result of a compromise that is difficult on some points, and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and other rapporteurs have achieved what is real and achievable on our behalf, and I personally deplore giving up the minimum age of 16 to sign an initiative.
We agree with the elements in the proposal aimed at ensuring equal treatment for Parliament and the Commission with regard to access to meetings and information, regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament, cooperation in citizens' initiatives, the impact assessment of legislation and the use of'freed law', not with regard to the implementation of European criminal law, and with regard to the strengthening of the European directives.
You all know that without access to the radio spectrum, there can be no broadcasting, and it is EU policy to ensure that all operators on the market have access to the radio spectrum without discrimination.
This approach must provide a comprehensive and comprehensive framework for the Commission's action to promote equality between men and women in the areas mentioned by the honourable Member, from employment to the other areas where equality must be guaranteed and guaranteed.
We would like to see the other political and economic heavyweight put on the table as well, which has not been the case so far for several of them.
in writing. - (CS) Dementia and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease are not only a serious medical problem, but also a very serious problem of ethical and social importance, which will apply to the population of Europe as a result of the ageing population.
I would also like to say that you have stressed very carefully that we should not confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with that of the European Union.
rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs who have worked on the details of this issue: Mr Szájer, Mr Duff, Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl.
We have, with the full support of all the European institutions: Minsk, please accept it, because you and the Belarusian people can gain a lot from it.
We need to monitor closely what is happening, because the President said that EUR 38 billion can be saved each year for European companies.
Now, even after the sentence made against Liu Xiaobo, we have seen a homoparty being banned by the police, which is clearly in danger of resulting in a political ice era for dissidents, human rights activists and homosexuals in China.
(SL) Commissioner, your report on Ukraine today was very clear.
However, we must bear in mind that this will only be possible if the parliaments are involved - the majority of the legal texts can only be adjusted by the parliaments - and that this process and the proposals relating to the transatlantic legislators' dialogue and the Joint Parliamentary Committee are particularly important.
Someone spoke of helicopters.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased to see you here and to listen to you.
That is what I would like to say about this agreement.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to women who help their spouses to work as self-employed.
Anyone who has been in Gaza after the conflict has witnessed the suffering of the people there.
(ES) Madam President, the relationship with the United States is the most important strategic association that the European Union has.
Frankly, it is our ambition to reach a political agreement at the June European Council.
However, we all know that Europe cannot do better and better with less money.
At the same time, the high number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting gives me the hope that the actions of such large numbers of allies will ultimately be successful.
Mr President, I would like to express my support for the proposal not to present a resolution because I have heard a passage in Mr Schulz's words, which I think is very important: if this debate is about'Europe' and not just about Italy, it makes no sense to vote on a resolution entitled'Freedom of information in Italy'.
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report.
Parliament's recommendation proposes adopting the regulation as proposed by the Council and not delaying the adoption further, because the new regulation will simplify the implementation of procedures and ensure equal treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the EU in the field of social security.
This is a rather shocking figure, and it is a figure I mentioned in a report I drafted during the previous mandate of this Parliament.
However, an EU policy for the Arctic is perhaps not as bizarre as the appointment of the highest unqualified Baroness Ashton, the Sarah Palin Left of former students, as High Representative.
One of these achievements is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea, which is, in fact, the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union, and it must become the measure for our future bilateral trade agreements.
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative amendment calling for the budget to be frozen at 2013 levels because I strongly believe that a reduction is needed and that their position is a weak starting point for the negotiations.
I believe that, with regard to the car industry, we have attached too little to the development of completely new types of vehicles, such as hydrogen vehicles, by battered cars and by fuel cells.
Then our roads are separate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic education in the European Union.
The European Union is willing, as a partner for Thailand, to assist the country as much as possible during this complex process.
Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow the creation of jobs and prosperity, is of real benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fish processing and canning industry, it was essential to carry out an impact assessment of the derogation as soon as possible and, where necessary, to facilitate its suspension.
The Commission and the Council are currently doing this in a very commendable manner in order to ensure that gas supplies are reopened as soon as possible; of course, the threat with legal procedures does not help.
The Member States must immediately examine the extreme human rights violations of Roma women, punish the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and compensated.
(LT) Mr President, it is indeed a complex case.
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with the national supervisory authorities, but also - and no one has mentioned this - of the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with committees of Europe, budgetary committees and budgetary committees.
Bearing in mind that the European External Action Service is implementing its rules for access to information and documents, I propose that you make this service a modern organisation available to citizens and that foreign policy does not regard it as something that is exclusively the preserve of a number of secrecy diplomats.
All Member States are reforming their economic policies with the aim of restoring the poor economic tide as soon as possible and of generating some economic growth.
Let me also tell you about the Japanese people.
Mr Barroso answered that this was an internal matter.
Therefore, we belong to that group of people who believe that we should not weaken Schengen, but preserve and strengthen it.
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity come directly from the Christian tradition.
It serves the interests of large companies, but it also distorts public transport and is so responsible for breaking the network and security.
On the other hand, we must not avoid discussing Turkey's future membership of the EU.
This risk must be dealt with effectively and, as the tragic event in Japan demonstrated, as an urgent issue.
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure better protection for workers at risk of injuries caused by sharp or pessimistic medical instruments.
In short, I have already finished this report this evening, but for me, the work is far from complete or is not ready for the European institutions.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and underline that, from the outset, my group was rather reluctant to accept SIS II, because of the many data protection implications.
We need to create the right conditions.
In 2009, the Ombudsman received a total of 3 098 complaints, against 3 406 complaints in 2008, which represents a 9% drop.
The ECJ also made it clear in its October ruling that workers should not be forced to actually take retire when reaching the retirement age.

(DE) Madam President, I voted in favour of the report because it clearly improves the current situation.
I voted in favour of this.
This report aims to increase the risk tolerance, simplifying bureaucratic control mechanisms and creating greater confidence in the scientific community and business community.
Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Daul said.
The resolution adopted today stresses the need to establish a common register as much as possible the involvement of the various groups of actors, while respecting their differences and specific characteristics.
As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to ask the President of the Commission about the images that we have received in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people, fleeing the situation in Africa, have arrived in Europe or, at times, not.
However, this is not happening now, and the sad example of this is the situation in Lampedusa.
Israel is bombing and decimating a ghetto.
We must listen to our ears, but it is also important to learn from experience.
in writing. - The link between the CAP and global food security is an important issue.
Thank you for this constructive and forward-looking debate.
It must be a partnership based on respect for each other, for our common commitments and also for the values that the European Union stands for in relation to human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
She represents 3% of EU GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion.
In this context, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled an amendment calling on us, as the Commissioner knows very well, to move quickly towards the complete abolition of all forms of export aid.
Most of the contributions highlight the need to amend the CAP and focus on the competitiveness of European agriculture, the ability to respond to climate change, food security and other environmental objectives.
We also believe that the negotiations on the Agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which will take place next May.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Of course, increasing the specific EU funding for cities is extremely important, because cities have major economic and financial opportunities and, in particular, there has been a severe crisis.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Auditors' report is, in fact, only presented officially next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control.

I will focus my attention on two reports, given their importance.

For the sake of Mr Weber, I refer to Rule.
I also welcome the positive words in the resolution on the continued efforts of FYROM to stabilise the region.
I hope that what Greece died today, a few hours ago, is not going to be infectious, and I hope that this will mark the beginning of a united effort to shape European identity through solidarity and partnership.
We were in touch with the people of Tunisia and Egypt from hours to hour, with our delegations, which I would like to pay tribute to the way in which they have gone over the last few weeks, and we also had direct contact with the government and services.
I am therefore convinced that this financial instrument will be of even greater value in the context of the financial crisis, because it will help businesses better recover and will be able to use it as a pilot project for creating a royalter energy fund in the future.
These inspections were insufficient.
However, we must prevent money from disappearing into soil rubbish.
I voted in favour of the European Ombudsman's particular report to the European Parliament, drafted on the basis of the draft recommendation submitted to the European Commission on complaint 676/2008/RT to the European Commission, which involved a serious delay in the European Commission's response to the Ombudsman's services.
The most important progress compared to the existing legislation with this directive is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and will be able to obtain information about the quality and safety of the care they receive.
Once again, the Commission must ensure the flexible application of the Solidarity Fund and revise the regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund and adapt it to the needs of the tragedy.
I understand that, after consulting consumer rights organisations and business representatives, we need to ensure even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union.
I said that whoever asked questions is the villain in this debate.
In other words, the European Parliament has the power and the duty to follow all the negotiations - in this case on trade - and to intervene politically with the parliamentary means at our disposal, such as hearings, resolutions and oral questions, so that we can keep up on how the negotiations are conducted.
There is no recognition of the role that citizens play in social cohesion or solidarity between generations.
However, real reform lies in the area of admissibility.
This is currently one of the most serious human rights problems within the European Union.
To this end, appropriate financial resources must be made available so that all opportunities can be exploited and new global competitive opportunities can be exploited by the European Union.
In many countries in Europe, public authorities are well known that, when they are in a difficult situation, they are usually paying, and very often the cause of companies going bankrupt.
The decommissioning of these tax havens was also one of the main objectives of the G20 Summit.
Unfortunately, the Polish political class is failing in this area.
Of course, the dollar is still conspicuous with international transactions and continues to be a safe investment, but the huge debt that the United States has created to finance their way of life by the rest of the world is increasingly questioning the capacity of the largest economic power to fulfil its obligations.
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and measures to combat and defeat those who want to destroy it.
It is significant that Iceland, when it was still a rich country, was not interested in membership of the European Union.
This, Mr Vice-President, is not said for the first time.
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development, involving everyone and achieving a very large level of local acceptance.
However, it is a problem that the fight against international terrorism will continue to export to neighbouring countries and regions as long as the fight continues in Afghanistan.
We must combat fragmentation and, therefore, Commissioner Andor, an urgent request to keep the European Social Fund together in the regulations in full and not split it up, as is being suggested in this House.
Of course, it is in the nature of the matter that we are not getting everything we want in a compromise, but what I think is important for us and what I would like to stress is that a greener CAP is in progress - I mean not only in terms of sustainable energy policy but also in terms of a sustainable agricultural policy.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, and the three rapporteurs, Mr Surján, Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug, for their constructive attitude throughout the budget procedure, which also shows the very good cooperation we had during that work.
The S & D Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia.
It would have been better to stress that the negotiations know an open end, opening the way for more realistic alternatives such as a privileged partnership.
This is therefore, first and foremost, an American problem that must be resolved by Washington.
I believe that we must also reform to make European universities more independent and Europeanised and accessible to students and researchers and to develop dynamic development in the knowledge economy.
The quotas purchased can be retained in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if the Member States so wish.
Therefore, I would like to call again on you to establish 25 May, the day of its execution, as International Day of the heroes of the Fight against Totalitarianism, because there are many unknown people like Pilecki who died in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms: we must keep the memory of them alive.
Let me quickly outline what we have done.
If this were to be the majority in the European Union in the next parliamentary term, we will destroy the construction of peace in Europe, which we funded with considerable sums following the war in the Balkans.
I hope that this will encourage people to take part in EMAS, not because it concerns me here, and because I want EMAS to be opposed to ISO, but because I believe that this is a good system and that it can help us to meet the sustainability criteria.
(DE) (The speaker answered a blue card question from Cristian Dan Preda in accordance with Rule 149 (8))
As several speakers have said, tomorrow's vote is very important, and I do not expect problems.
Monetary dumping and its social consequences cannot continue to be accepted.
This aspect is very important for an effective Neighbourhood Policy.
By identifying the best practices created by the experience of the Member States and by establishing fundamental standards such as non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation, we are laying the foundations for a coherent European policy in this area.
I know that during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products, stakeholders in the sheep meat sector argued for mandatory remarking of origin.
I am aware of the complexity of this issue, Mr Kelly.
Even at a time when most countries are experiencing a series of economic and financial problems, particular attention must be paid to the failure to address the negative effects of climate change.
I ask for your support for this amendment.
However, we must acknowledge that this report seriously accelerates parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system.
Therefore, the general scope of these measures has been expanded.

Syria still has a long way to go when it comes to freedom of expression and association.

I supported this report because I consider one of the threats mentioned in it to be particularly important, namely, the lack of reliable and wide-ranging information for consumers about the nutritional value, composition and origin of the various fish species.
The past is full of examples of intervention by Western countries that have done more harm than good.
As rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is ineffective for various reasons and is not suitable for combating crime prevention, firstly, that it was unable to achieve the objectives it was set up.
This Palestinian agreement is a very important political event and, unlike what has just been said here, for the first time, Hamas has agreed that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority act as its negotiating partners.
Countries are fighting and negotiating the distribution of seabed.
This sector is particularly important, especially given our knowledge of the energy infrastructure problems...
In other words, it is precisely the institution that has been set up to protect us against criminals (indirectly, by training to police people) that is now in the cloud.

The number of falsified medicinal products will only be reduced and their use will only be made safer if such measures are taken.

It is important that we have made progress in this direction with the Vlasák report, which I fully support, and I believe that this report will allow us to shape the legal framework of urban policy and introduce instruments such as municipal implementation plans as implementing plans for new quality cohesion policy.
It became clear to me during the trialogue negotiations that the improvements I made on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and effective energy markets.
In the current economic crisis, it is vitally important to support and encourage self-employed women and men.
This means, therefore, that the money does not need to be requested to Brussels.
Mr President, it is clear to all of us in Europe, including the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, that energy is an instrument of foreign policy, that energy is a factor that can bring about change, create conflict and unite us, and that is precisely what we are talking about here today.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report because the food programme that is intended to extend is an essential instrument for providing assistance to disadvantaged people, who are suffering a great deal during the current economic crisis, even if it comes to meeting basic needs.
in writing. - (LT) Most industrialised countries, including all EU Member States and most emerging countries, have at least one officially supported export credit agency (ECA - ECA), and these are the world's main source of public financing for projects in the private sector.

Opening of the sitting
I hope that from this summer onwards, the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the strategy in terms of evolution in key areas such as the promotion of citizens' education, vocational orientation and employment.
The costs will be borne by the home country.
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to create a more sustainable transport system.
The decision to enter into dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is of particular importance to stability in the region.
We can therefore assume that there is an accident involving a nuclear reactor every 25 years.
I believe that this increase in the eligibility of housing cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund should be an incentive to consider other possible developments in the medium and long term, which may be in the area of eligibility or reserving funds for certain strategic priorities.
Today is the time to discuss again the violation of religious rights in both countries, this time against Christians.
Climate change is one of the biggest dangers to our planet.
As expected, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on human rights, and it was made clear how important it is to ensure that human rights are included in all dynamic relations and work.
I would also like to say that, up to now, the European Union has no jurisdiction whatsoever in regulating air traffic.
However, Europe is not a gift or an economic crisis.
I can therefore inform the rapporteur that the Commission has already taken steps on comitology and the necessary provisions.
I think that all the warm words spoken here this afternoon about Libya, including by the Commission, cannot hide the fact that the European Union is absent in Libya; it is not possible to stop even the crisis in the cities and Mr Gaddafi's fundamental assassinations at the moment.
I am therefore convinced that, if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations, it will be a very beautiful gift for the citizens of the EU, because they will have much more options of choice.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I share the hope that agreement will be reached in the European Council on measures to calm the markets and to restabilise the euro area because, whether we are members, we should all have an interest in that.
The pre-accession aid shows that it is particularly sensitive to fraud.
That is a reason for great gratitude and pleasure.
We call for an end to the war and violence of all parties, and we urge the European Union to contribute to this.
The world outside Europe does not take half measures to combat the energy crisis.
The energy performance indicator of buildings must be mentioned in advertisements for sale or rental.
Greater efforts must be focused on increasing EU investment, especially to diversify cross-border structures, promote alternative, non-traditional energy at local level and improve infrastructure capacity to facilitate the connection with new energy sources.
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market, leading to an increase in internal demand and economic activity.
Secondly, we need to consider developing a rapid response instrument within the ENP to respond quickly and flexibly to political changes in the partner countries, as happened recently in the southern neighbourhood.
I think it is completely absurd that someone here in Parliament reject the EULEX mission that Serbia even supports.
The problem is that only those Members who control the withholding language will listen to what is said.
We have lost a lot of money.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated the fact that during the Swedish Presidency, issues were highlighted which interest our fellow citizens, our voters, who are interested in the environment and climate change, the financial crisis, the protection of jobs and the fight against crime, as we need to be on the same footing as those who voted on us.
At a time of austerity, the EU budget cannot, as advocated by some Members, be used to complement the national budget; on the contrary, the EU budget must reflect the difficulties that the Member States themselves are experiencing.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Treaty has not given the Council any power to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States.
This is not a business as usual.
Numerous of you will tell me only cynically, but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always come for a short visit.
Will the global financial crisis, which has resulted in an economic crisis, look at the situation, or do we need to look for the reason for our mistakes, negligence and lack of action?
My second'but' has to do with the role that the Belgian Presidency played in the post-Lisbon era.
The main objective of these governments was, and is to hold, the territory of this vast state, which is inhabited by very different peoples.
(PL) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe, we are still struggling with its negative consequences.
That is the case with Japan in most areas, but I would like to allow - to cite an example - Japanese people to protect their rice market and their rice producers and to pay them a higher price than they are on the world market, and I think that Japan has the right to reject imports, because this would have catastrophic consequences for farmers.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to talk about two concepts: coordination and flexibility.
For example, only 15% of elderly people use the Internet.
I am therefore determined to work in accordance with this new strategy in order to strengthen the social priority, as I said to you when we discussed the broader political guidelines for the next mandate.
Therefore, Commissioner, I am going to ask you without controversy what measures - I am consciously taking here - the Commission intends to take in the short term in order to remedy these shortcomings.
So far, it has not been clear whether it has not been sufficiently visible to citizens.
It takes no interest whatsoever to citizens.
- (The sitting was closed at 0.10 p.m.)
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal and adopt Mrs Muscardini's report with an overwhelming majority, and I thank her and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Susta.

I am referring not only to accidents of work, but also to hazardous substances in the workplace.
The Council started a close investigation into the proposal to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in September 2009.
At the moment, it is important for us to pay particular attention to the insular and peripheral regions which, in addition to the obstacles they are already facing, are now facing with the destruction of infrastructure and personal, commercial and agricultural assets and, in many cases, unable to continue their activities immediately, especially for regions that are almost exclusively dependent on tourism, as the media can deter these potential disasters.
Since 9/11, we have not experienced such disruption from industry, with such huge financial losses, and despite the financial difficulties that all Member States are facing, I would urge them to support plans to support an industry that simply cannot afford further losses.
At the same time, we must admit that we are also exposed to more risks.
Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution because there is a terrible situation in the Congo.
(ES) Mr President, I have a minor linguistic remark, perhaps also semantic.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
We can want, but we can see the reality.
Consumer organisations prefer binding measures for a judicial system for collective redress in all Member States, together with other options, such as the extension of AV dispute resolution mechanisms to collective progress.
Not Turkish Cypriots are the problem, as some claim.
I would like to ask the Commission what it is going to do to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their country of origin without first having to make a long, stressful trip to the land of consumption.
That is what we have to do.
I ask myself seriously, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened to human rights defenders who, like us, are pleased that the West is secular and pluralistic, and who are shamefully averting their eyes from a Middle East that is increasingly reserved with just one religion.
This is already happening and we are in discussions with the authorities of these countries.
(NL) Mr President, bankers who are burdened with our money are contemptible, but, Mr Schulz, politicians who are currently making deficits and debt unrestricted and are sending the bill to younger generations are equally irresponsible.
I would like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies, as well as the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various political groups for their contribution.
We believe that the Member States must now bridge the gap.
Mr President, cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for democracy and human rights was very good.
We must strive to ensure that the programme's choice is in keeping with the reforms in those countries in order to move closer to the European Union.
It is also essential for Member States to establish national contact points to provide patients with the necessary information, including on available health services, procedures and necessary documents.
It was all that happened in the Soviet Union that we had ideological pressure, but today it is primarily about trade against the backdrop of absolute human freedom.
Quite apart from the question of whether there is private or public funds, this report specifically concerns Parliament's commitment to ensuring that there is no legal right to supplement deficit and that, secondly, that we do not actually complement deficits.
This has to be the most expensive bail-out since Helena's Troje was rescued when a thousand ships were deployed.
Support which distorts competition undermines the future of the European car industry and has negative consequences for employment and technical development.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in relation to this debate, I think that we should not lose sight of certain aspects.
You have already heard several fellow Members say that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with reverse voting procedure.
(FR) I believe that it is very important for us to return to the issues at stake in this regard.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 (8))
In order to unite us in a campaign to stop this barbaric ritual, I invite you all to spare up a rozenship today, as a symbol of our opposition to this practice.
It is shocked that democratic control is being stepped up, since national governments are hiding behind the Commission and the Trojka and, in turn, referring to national governments.
Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate)
Following threats from the Commission concerning judicial proceedings at the European Court of Justice, Sweden has now begun to authorise deca-BDE.
It is clear to those of us who come from rural constitutions, and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that the position that many farmers currently find themselves in is simply unsustainable.
Companies deserve transparent information, easily understood and easily available.
I believe that it could be our job to help the Chinese people achieve a harmonious society.
During the vote, I supported these two mechanisms because I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to increase budgetary stability in Europe, thereby ensuring our future.
It is also important for the organiser of the initiative, a social organisation or NGOs, to clearly and clearly decide what the issue and purpose of the initiative is, even though it must not submit a legislative proposal that is necessary.
There is a town in Latvia, Daugavpils, where more than 90% of people speak Russian.
In this respect, I welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer's apologies, as well as the Czech Government's recent decision on the need for the public health Ministry to take a number of measures by 31 December 2009 to ensure that such human rights violations no longer take place.
I welcome the report because GDP is an indicator of economic activity that has become a permanent reference point used by policy makers throughout the world.
Now the effects of globalisation have been completely overshadowed by the global financial and economic crisis, and our considered response is to adjust the eligibility criteria.

Compared with the other two institutions, Parliament still has a leading role in terms of transparency, and therefore I would not like to make it my top priority, because both in terms of access to documents and the transparency of meetings and activities of MEPs are more open than any national parliament.
It was a manifestation of the domestic policy of the Italian Minister for Reform, Umberto Bossi.
The alarming reports of the Observatory on Human Rights of Asturias - my region - and many other organisations should be taken seriously.
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini's report.
I deeply regret the adoption of the resolution to reject thrombin in pig and beef.
I have therefore decided to abstain and will be following the ongoing investigation closely.

Ladies and gentlemen, on the day of day before the victims of terrorism, I would like to make a statement.

With regard to the second question, I can assure honourable Members that the Commission is aware that the management of AMR requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Yesterday's trialogue created a great deal of confidence that agreement can finally be reached.
Future forecasts based on an annual growth of around 27% in the forthcoming period indicate that the volume is EUR 11 billion by 2015.
Nevertheless, I believe that the legal basis of the proposal must be adapted so that, rather than a Council decision, it has the form of a regulation.
There are many people who ask me what the rebate of ACTA is for, and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).
I voted in favour of this report because this EU financial aid will help people who have been victims of globalisation to find employment and return to the labour market and help them to escape from the recession.
Given that the Internet is the most important instrument for improving the conditions, development and knowledge of citizens, especially by sending audiovisual content, I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the field of radio spectrum and the creation of development and software.
Take into account the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe and the problems that would arise as a result of the admission of a directly neighbouring country to the Union, with more than 80 million people, all of whom I firmly believe that Turkish membership is inappropriate in a Europe that has as a common denominator in Christianity in particular.
Thank you, Mr President.
(Protests from the floor)
This is detrimental to the environment and consumer safety, because old, potentially hazardous equipment with a high level of energy consumption is placed on the market once again.
Thank you for your attention and look forward to this debate.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the mayor of Balcond, Dr Reitemann and the local council, which have enabled these young men to be brought to the fore.
Thirdly, I would like to urge Mrs Kroes to speed up the digitisation in the Member States of the European Union so that we can be proud of this large-scale and prestigious project in the future.
Anyone who experienced and attacked the results of the technological disaster in Baia Mare, as well as the subsequent disappearance of waste containing toxic cyanide in various water, with severe consequences for the fauna of the Tiszazaria in Hungary and the Danube in Bulgaria, is prepared to do everything possible to ensure that this never happens again in the European Union.
This is the responsibility of everyone, of the Member States, of the Commission, of the Council and of Parliament.
Climate change costs developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year in the future.
Secondly, there is the right of refugees to return to their homes and property: the fundamental right of free movement, as you said, to cross the divorce lines.
I therefore agree with ECON when she proposes rejecting the Commission's proposal.
The most important thing is that we have had the courage to convene this summit, to invite the social partners to prepare us with them for a long time before the Employment Summit, three rounds of discussion will take place in Stockholm, Madrid and Prague, and to try to reach conclusions that will be appropriate for the Council meeting.
Indeed, at first reading, the European Parliament already provided a good basis for the proper application of the rules for cross-border healthcare in the Member States, so that patients can be given access to the political clinical or hospital care they need in justified cases and under the rules laid down and without punishing the courts in another Member State.
That was what was proposed in the Barnier report, but so far we have not reached a conclusion.
But, of course, we are also talking about an entire process, which is the beginning of the action plan.
Once again, such a grotesque distortion of reality is being faced once again with a blatant attempt by the European Parliament to interfere with Venezuela.
At the end of 2009, the Commission published a discussion to collect new data and the views of the various categories of users on this issue, and we will soon come back to the results of this public consultation.
Thank you for your participation.
This is also stipulated in the European Convention on Human Rights in case someone is held in detention.
I hope that this amendment will receive majority support tomorrow.
The Commission communication on Copenhagen forms the basis for further developing the European Union's views on these important elements, enabling us to maintain our leading position and help to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion in Copenhagen.
Secondly, at this stage, the Commission does not have a clear response to many of the questions and issues raised by honourable Members, such as geographical coverage, deposits or existence of Objective 2 regions, the appropriate financial basis, transitional arrangements or the status of individual groups or regions.
Secondly, the promotion of fundamental rights is a priority in the Stockholm Programme, which outlines the strategic guidelines for developing an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen this time to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to help around 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering the consequences of the economic crisis and because extraordinary times require exceptional measures.
Impact assessments must be able to ensure that the Commission does not intervene when its actions appear to be useless, unnecessary or costly.
The Arab League Plan, the Saudi Arabia peace plan, speaks of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist - an ambitious and courageous plan!
The EU must ensure that the poorest countries receive more effective aid and, if appropriate, debt cancellation.
The Czech Presidency has also seen the significance of this dossier and I think that we have achieved a good result, including for all people who want to be free in Europe.
Just imagine how transferring that aid through spending from the European Union will result in savings.
