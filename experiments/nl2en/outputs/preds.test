The Serbian authorities must do everything they can to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy in the country are properly observed and ensure that corruption is continuously reduced in Serbia and that officials responsible for criminal abuse of office are punished.
On the contrary, the programme contains important plans which may exacerbate these serious problems: in order to be brief, the Europe that we are fighting for - the Europe of justice and social progress, economic and social cohesion, cooperation between sovereign Member States with equal rights and peace initiatives - cannot be achieved by the political guidelines that the Commission intends to follow.
It is important from the point of view of both democracy and legitimacy to make it clear to citizens what the EU is doing.

Unfortunately, important amendments have also been rejected by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, resulting in the failure of EU citizens who are not nationals of a Member State to sign initiatives that exclude the equal participation of all residents, irrespective of their origin, as well as the guarantee that the signature of the signatories' signature will not be compared with their identity card numbers.
I call for the creation of an independent committee composed of local and international legal experts to lead the investigation and prosecution of the violent events following the poor elections in December 2007.

It is therefore crucial to adopt measures to ensure more transparent and independent impact assessments, as this will contribute to the best possible use of this instrument's role in decision making and ensure the quality and suitability of the activities of European institutions.
My second comment is that the strategy should also strengthen the European Union's internal cohesion and convergence.

Bearing in mind that it seems to be a little long way from the Mercosur agreement, all the more so when you are luggage that the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology has pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef is sometimes up to 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
As agreed with the Council at the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, i.e. Article 1 (b) of the amended regulation, should be added to the following text:'The same reference rate will be applied to the value of Articles 4, 4 and 6 (3), if these rates have been pushed into the currency'), then the euro will be subject to an annual review.
Today, the Irish Government has requested European solidarity and rightly received it.
We only need to look at Ireland, which has been hit very hard by the economic crisis, and membership of the monetary union has required Ireland to cope with an even greater crisis of scale.
He is afraid of Sudeten German land claims and, if I hear German politicians speak of this issue, I think his fear is completely justified.
increasing the support of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, which can also provide greater financial support for technical activities related to the preparation and implementation of projects;
We will not achieve anything without the introduction of an instrument that will help countries to be hit by harsh consequences when conducting irrational economic policies.
We need to strengthen and promote our further activities to deal with climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always with complex issues of this kind, I could not have imagined without the great support and cooperation of my own team of shadow rapporteurs - Bernadette Vergnaud, Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle.
Freedom of the press and of the media is a huge problem in Russia.
It is also up to each Member State to decide whether or not they ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minority Languages and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, two important instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.
This is a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to discuss issues that concern us.
Thirdly, the whole issue of sustainability, where people who have been protected and who have been given support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to be completely transformed or retraining in one year or two to find new jobs; preserve existing jobs.
(NL) Mr President, our questions were aimed at raising awareness, including European citizens, of the benefits and profits that such a package should be expected and what we are offering, and that is not what you can give here in two minutes or in five or six minutes.
I voted in favour of this report because it also makes a number of substantial improvements to the European Commission's text, especially in the area of the protection of personal data.
In addition, we revised the unused funds from 2009, making a total of 1.9 billion energy and a further 420 million broadband Internet available in Corategory II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and your very clear message.
We can also see something from this, including the attempt to have a holistic approach, which has not been as successful as we had proposed it, but nevertheless is on the right path.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission - which was, at times, a little poison - and the Council, with which we attempted to find meaningful solutions at night and during many trialogue meetings, because they also adopted the reasonable compromise that we found an hour ago.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated measures, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, has set up a European Aviation Coordination Centre after the Council meeting of Ministers on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that it is rarely the actual problem, in this case illegal logging, that the conditions for trade in illegal timber create.
Moreover, I come from a country, Portugal, and from a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector occupies and is deeply rooted in socially vulnerable regions where it is vital that the quota system is maintained after 2015.
People are not the product of a culture; cultures are the product of people.
In some cases, they are indeed so good that we should consider them.
(SV) Mr President, with around 300 000 inhabitants, Iceland is a small country in terms of population, but it is a wonderful country.
Mr President, Members of the European Parliament play an important role in verifying health claims.
That is why we are talking about Nabucco as a full yes, but at the same time we are strongly decided to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure the diversification of energy supply as a guarantee of the well-being of our people.
Political parties can be banned, there is corruption in the legal system, human rights violations and freedom of expression and association do not exist in the same way as in countries like Britain or most other European states.
It is, of course, also clear that we need an energy mix made up of different energy sources that is as broad as possible, because it stabilises the energy situation that brings about the diversity of each nation and also of Europe's law.
However, I have doubts when this Parliament is concerned with international law in condemning some appalling practices when the legal basis for this is far from clear.
By giving my support to this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I express my complete solidarity with the Tunisian people and the historic, democratic revolution that has brought the people to bear.
It also calls on Member States to take appropriate measures and to adopt an effective policy, such as national action plans or targeted social measures, to reduce energy poverty and to report on their actions in this area in a regular way.
After all, if you now pass a law through Parliament in Hungary and say that, from now on, it can only be changed by a two-thirds majority, you know that, after the next elections, it is not easy to change it.
General tariff preferences (debate)
During today's plenary session, we voted on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
When we are talking about a new common trust, we still face another major problem.
We allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS this year, but we will only be able to assess the actual costs after the first year of activity if a report on expenditure relating to the activities of the EEAS will be submitted to the European Parliament.
My question to Pakistan is that, as we all know, the chronic instability of this country is a crisis factor for the whole region and also Afghanistan.
Of course, we must not overlook the natural biological differences between women and men.
These factors must not be forgotten, including in the case of earmarking of infrastructure charges referred to in the proposal.
(HU) Mr President, I welcome the fact that this directive clearly establishes patients' rights, stops the endless waiting lists and proposes a solution in cases where there is no professional aid in their own country.
Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I would like to respond directly to the issues and questions that have been raised.
In committee, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being an emergency President last week.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran, because I am concerned about the constant violations of human rights in the country, particularly with regard to freedom of association, expression and information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran.
Especially important will be fast-start financing.
It is one thing to do with such a mechanism, but it is another thing else to make it accessible and comprehensible to European citizens and thus enable them to make maximum use of it.
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive, it will also make them safer, since regulatory and enforcement authorities will cooperate more closely in the areas of certification, inspections and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest possible level of security for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know whether, as the European Parliament, we can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
The private aspect of this will not only strengthen the image that Europe gives to the world, but will also promote European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that we are discussing is intended to amend the regulation adopted in 2004, which was designed to improve and harmonise the standards on the security features of passports and travel documents issued by the Member States in order to better protect them against fraudulent use.
Secondly, a kind of temporary institutional framework must be set up for the mechanism for implementing decisions.
Having said that, it is a good thing that some of the agreements that we have concluded in recent times are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important for us, as Parliament, to remind the Commission once again of the social clause already enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Serbia, which acknowledges that the current constructive cooperation with the European Union is a lot and much more effective than it is trying to redefine history.
Sadly, until today, the European Commission has not yet found the necessary grounds or time to encourage Latvian government to put an end to this discrimination on the grounds of language.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to link all forms of assistance to Pakistan's government with the urgent lifting of the deadly discrimination against religious minorities.
This will be an effective means of preventing illegal migration, organised crime and human trafficking.
This is nothing wrong; we fought for this freedom.
It is clearly more necessary than ever for financial institutions to remain silent and reassess their approach.
Our common objective - which we have also achieved in committee - is to minimise by-catches and discards from fish to discards.
The main objective of trade aid is to increase the internal and international competitiveness of these 48 countries.
Even though you agree that the rationality of internalising external costs is a sound starting point, it is still unsustainable to make large lorries and not passenger cars pay for congestion, just as the old slogan'polluter pays' is clearly applied in a discriminatory manner.
I am encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary session.
When we look at the starting point, there are a number of issues that concern us.
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of the Member States - whether these centre-right or centre-left governments - is to ensure that the monopolies remain profitable and shift the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers' shoulders and grassroots classes throughout the European Union.
To this end, more efforts must be made to spread good practices and to convince local decision makers of the potential of information and communication technologies.
Mr President, we could not hear the interpretation of the previous speaker.
However, there is a very important aspect of this recast, this codification, which relates to the reprogramming of the TEN-T networks over the next 10 years.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the citizens of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also extremely important for the citizens of the European Union, because Ukraine is an important partner of us, especially as regards the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
That is why the Commission must make a strong voice.
We cannot interfere in an issue that only the government of the United States has competence.
Those responsible for managing the forests receive little or no money for this silence and, of course, for many of us who have been clearly considered tasks.
Unfortunately, it should also be noted that the list of unresolved problems has become more than shorter.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the valuable report by Mr Salafranca on an EU strategy for Latin America, I would like to urge the Council and the Commission to take action on three points today by Baroness Ashton.
There are large dealers, who have a strong market position in some Member States, but also many smaller ones, who are more satisfied with the rules that we are proposing than with which we have been in force since 2002, because they saw that certain aspects, which were not as intended by the legislator in 2002, have not been in their interest, have made it more difficult to cope with big dealers' competition.
It must set up the'regional EU political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', for which the Committee on Development promoted with its April 2007 report.
Throughout those years and especially after the historic expansion of 2004, the context and ambitions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy have changed radically.
Spain is blocking the Presidency of the European Union just as the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force.
In this sense, it is important for the first European radio spectrum policy programme to be consistent with the objectives already set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the Digital Agenda and for the programme to be part of the core actions of the Single Market Act.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) I would like to strongly support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's draft was amended in accordance with the report that is now being voted on, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
That is why it is important for us to reach an agreement at first reading.
Precisely these people need our help most, so they cannot be excluded on the basis of their residence place.
The various forms of medical assistance may vary from one another; they are all covered by the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
However, I would like to remind this House that a recent study by the European Social Assembly or Cardiology proves once again that this method has serious restrictions on women's participation in these tests.
The idea is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but to prevent us from achieving social objectives.
I also want more emphasis to be placed on the reuse of organic waste, especially in this predominantly agricultural region, the verification of data and the implementation of a system of exchanges of best practice.
The law which says that orthodox priests, bishops and patriarchand Turkish citizens must be completely incomprehensible.
The most relevant aspect of this Parliament's position is the fact that it draws attention to the lack of consistency between the existing measures and the contradictions that this may entail within the legislation, but especially in implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has secured the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
In any case, the digital common market has been pushed through to the European priorities.
This would be an important step towards transparency, openness and clarity in the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), because it makes absolutely sense to discuss this.
Is this the economic development model that Europe offers?
As a rule, I take the floor as someone goes over, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was very high for all of us.
We need a realistic strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, a strategy which, once implemented, will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region.
This is certainly a great achievement, because this directive, leaving aside the legal basis, recognises the indisputable rights of patients and provides them with a series of new options for choosing better treatment.
Year after year, the European Court of Auditors was unable to reassure us that EU money was spent in a legitimate and regular manner, and I was really concerned about the lack of control of taxpayers' money when I was, in 2002, the main auditors of the European Commission.
For me, this represents both an enormous challenge and a great honour.
If we are honest, we must recognise that we are historically responsible for climate change and that our emissions per capita are still the multiple number of those of China or India, for example.
I am sure that a constructive dialogue will now follow.
Therefore, as with Europol, we regret the fact that the desire to guarantee fundamental freedoms has been rushed to haste.
I agree with the Commission's proposal aimed at introducing an additional and simpler method for spending the ESF in order to be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social issues that Europe is currently facing.
To say the truth, I should have voted against the proposed composition of the Commission, but alongside the weak candidates, there were also some good candidates, including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but there are 26 other Member States in the European Union except Britain, and we have an open ear to your concerns, but you will understand that I must also take the legitimate concerns of others seriously.
I think that we should carefully monitor the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian response in this respect, even though this is sometimes difficult in crisis regions.
The resolution also recalls the need for the full control of the investigations in the name of the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States and, finally, the resolution shows concern about the pressure on NGOs involved in drafting the Goldstone report and its subsequent investigations, including the reference to the restrictive measures imposed on them.
I also hope that this decision will help to preserve extinction of fish species.
I hope that you will not see my questions as a provocation, but as a help in your considerations.
I am always prepared - and hopefully also able to report to you on our results - but we must, of course, verify what we are discovering first.
This result will strengthen the European Union's negotiating position in international trade negotiations, especially in the World Trade Organisation Doha negotiations currently under way.
If Europe speaks with one voice, the United States will also stand by this objective.
Therefore, I support the fixed prices for European tobacco producers, at least as long as Europe is in decline.
When we look at Member States' efforts in this area, it is clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
For this reason, I would like an independent European Social Fund that separate European structural policy.
The number of new infections continues to rise faster than the increase in treatment capacity, with 2% of people suffering from the treatment they needed, meaning that 10 million affected did not have access to the necessary effective treatment.
In fact, when human dignity is valued, we do not see minorities as negative at all.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify that fund.
In future, all EU institutions should ensure that our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses to overcome difficult economic times and to plan for recovery.
The fastest way to achieve this cure process, much more efficient and more effective than a top-down approach, is to support citizens' initiatives, cultural organisations and regional institutions in their activities.
Anyone who is still opposed to this treaty today because he wrongly believes that this is a treaty that makes the European Union stronger must know that, in fact, they are actually making those who oppose this treaty stronger, so in fact, our so-called partners, or rather our opponents, actually make it stronger.
The European Union has been generous of global capitalism, and this sort of clarification will help us all.
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will continue to develop a network for other modes of transport.
You will remember that it was a bicycle fight, because it was even brought before the Court of Justice, and the Commission - and I have to pay tribute to this - was clear, clearer at the time than the Council, and we fully supported the Commission.
Mr Madlener was the first to speak this morning.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, it is clear what line the governments of the European nuclear states, the Commission and the ECB are taking.
Moreover, I would like to remind you that, according to recent groupings in the European Union, we still have more than 20 million unemployed people, already 25 million people have been unemployed, so that even more asylum seekers are actually a kind of collective suicide.
The Commission must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
For its economic recovery, Sri Lanka depends on direct foreign investment and EU economic aid.
We fully support the Vaccine Initiative's objective, but we cannot support the decommitment that refers to Parliament's vote on abortion, among other things, and that is against a previous explanation of vote that we have allowed into the minutes of Parliament.
This document is the result of a compromise based on comprehensive negotiations, which will improve passenger rights without imposing additional burdens on carriers.
It is really high time that the'E' was launched in the EMU by creating a genuine, effective economic union as the last step towards the integration of European economic policy.
The subject of children's rights in the context of external relations is of particular interest to me.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has been working on legislative instruments on economic immigration for over 10 years.
The Stihler report is a useful instrument for eliminating the national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products into the EU and is useful for the further development of the internal market in construction products.
If we really want to meet the objectives that we have set for our foreign policy in the treaties, I think we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants who are staying illegally in the EU back to Libya.
I therefore voted in favour of the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships, and I believe that everyone should strive for innovation because, as I said, this is very important for the future.
We have a new elected government in the United Kingdom that has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Luís Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 establishing specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
We cannot allow efforts to be undermined so far in the name of the economic crisis, which is why we cannot combine with policies on the economic crisis and environmental policy, thereby achieving good results both for the environment and for employment.
There are countries that do not use their ESF resources and just 30%, 40% unspent.
The Commission has said that it had and published information, which was also obliged, but I think the question is why this was de facto unknown.
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I fully support the proposal to launch an effective information campaign to increase the visibility of the points of single contact.
It is a little strange, however, if the Spanish Presidency calls on the economic crisis to be combated and for the implementation of economic objectives to be binding.
Today, I supported the introduction of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection because I believe that the blockade in the Council under the language arrangements is not justified.
I repeat: the Treaty clearly states that a state must not be forced to take on debt.
I would like to remind you of the European Parliament and the Council's joint agreement to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
I would like to assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues, including the highest level, and that we will continue to remind the People's Republic of China of its international human rights obligations.
I hope - and I am very confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement.
First of all, I regret the absence of Mr McCreevy's colleague, Mr McCreevy, and the horrors' interest rate has certainly begun.
For example - you probably do not know this - extensive animal testing must be carried out to verify such statements.
What worries me somewhat, Commissioner, is the major impact of the CCARS 21 group and the industry's influence on the process that is now under way.
We do not agree.
The European aid earmarked for 2007-2010 for democratic development and good governance in the Republic of Moldova amounts to more than EUR 50 million.
What is incomprehensible to us, however, is that an illegal worker is accepted and ultimately punished for those who allow him to provide for a living and subsistence cost.
I believe that a measuring system that takes into account various student parameters will result in policy decisions which will better meet the general needs of society and the economy.
At the same time, I would like to point out that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on the lifting of restrictions on all freedoms and the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights defenders.
Finally, Madam High Representative, you are going to the Middle East.
Indeed, one month after the launch of the International Criminal Court in July 2002, the US Congress was questioned by the adoption of the so-called American Department of Protection Act.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a short explanation, to point out that the amendments adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were included in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, following the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 19 June 2008, rejecting the European Commission's proposal to authorise the marketing of poultry meat after the consumption of human beings.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my condolences to the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, as well as my deep concern for the other four Cuban prisoners and one opposition activist who has gone into hunger strike.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should be that no cents must be wasted.
The Union, especially the Mediterranean countries, has always had a leading role in providing humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, because it is essential that we show our solidarity with people living in such difficult conditions.
Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for the communication they have made today.
However, Mrs Guillaume's report, which may have been improved by a number of amendments, is one big invitation to abuse the procedure; the services involved will be detained and those who really need it will be deprived of the possibility of a quick investigation of their dossier.
It is now time to take responsibility and do everything in our power, so I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their excellent work on which we can all benefit.
We have really worked out a huge programme with a number of major and important reports.
These social dumping is a major threat to workers because it is undermining their rights.
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Congo.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to refer to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of any proposal and questions or the area concerned cannot be assessed in advance, not only in view of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, but also the specific characteristics of the region, so that criteria can be set which will allow each country to plan from the outset.
We also need to look more closely at the problems of Roma women, who are particularly suffering from poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and then the situation of the Roma young people, who are even more difficult to access the labour market due to their lack of qualifications, at this time of economic crisis.
I am pleased to vote in favour of the proposed amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as it aims to extend the scope of the fund with interventions in the housing sector for marginalised communities in all Member States.
It is also a reminder to all policy makers of their area of competence, that there is a task for public authorities in the area of effective freedom of the press: they must be prepared to protect freedom of expression and encourage their development.
Mr President, I think that the European Union has become too large, has far too many cultures, and I trust this system just not for a metre, and it will get worse.
It is a little too early for us to know the result of that analysis and, as the Member knows, any process requires unanimity in the Council.
It should also be noted that the prospect of future EU membership is the strongest incentive for the Balkans to carry out the necessary reforms, and this perspective also plays an important role in the region's stability.
At a time when advertising plays an increasingly important role, it is essential that we define the criteria with which consumers and patients can be fully aware of and sure what effects these medicines have.
To speak in the words of Neil Armstrong, it is a small step for European funds, but an enormous leap forward for the European economy.
Thirdly, it is always being said that there will be security holes if we do not approve the interim agreement, which is simply not true.
In addition, the rapid emergence of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has led to an increase in the supply of online games and to the emergence of cross-border issues which remain unresolved.
All decision makers should have equal access to professional information on the country of origin of asylum seekers and the competent professional authorities on this issue, as should the asylum seekers themselves.
Therefore, after all these years, I am well aware of the huge step that has been made towards creating the only multinational parliament in the world that has been elected on the basis of universal electoral law.
The 27 EU Member States spend EUR 200 billion annually on defence, a sum that must be spent better than it was in the past.
Together, we have been able to make a difference.
In addition, during this parliamentary term, we are going to control services of general interest.
I would therefore like to propose, for example, that we call on Mr Almunia, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, as he was rather critical of certain countries during his term of office before the Greek issue.
In this respect, major reforms are needed in Turkey.
In the past, the EGF was used by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, and this time it is necessary to grant this aid to Lithuania.
Mr of spent fuel and radioactive waste (debate)
I will mention only the most recent cases, such as the destruction of the Catheal of the city of Vinh Long, which was replaced by a public park, and the use of returbulldozers and bulldozers to remove the status of the Philippine Maria from the Catholic land in Hanoi.
Moreover, this fund plays an important role in the training of workers, lifelong learning, improving employment opportunities and integrating workers into the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
I am therefore voting in favour of rejecting the Commission's proposal.
That is what I supported during the vote.
There is only one answer to this: growth.
