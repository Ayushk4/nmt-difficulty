Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a turning point for the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report under discussion in the European Parliament on Wednesday clearly show that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much worse impact on the environment than internal production , which is subject to stricter rules on reductions in carbon dioxide emissions , thereby contributing to climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that those countries to which these funds are allocated are unable to use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The national maritime authorities must cooperate more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes and also offer opportunities for paid labour transmission and exchange of experience in European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we have noted is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
Frontex is needed support , and the EU should also force the authorities in the Member States to do their bit .
I would like to mention another aspect that no one has yet spoken about , except Commissioner Almunia .
The areas associated with the risk of climate change are primarily the following : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , and , last but not least , the health of citizens :
Let me also express my disappointment at the death of nine Turkish soldiers and Jandarmerma , both my personal and the Commission , as a result of the terrorist attack last week .
Mr Piebalgs , I congratulate you on everything you do .
However , it is gratifying that , given the objections and the concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on the limitation of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and causing problems in several Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments that I supported and increased the initially intended appropriations ( for example under heading 150202 of the Lifelong Learning Training Programme ) .
Then there was a minority government with completely different political sentiments , but no one considered that a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , the international community , were calmly looking at the fact that the issue of Abyei remains unresolved in a referendum is , in fact , extremely irresponsible and could give rise to a new outbreak of war in the future .
The case of Marian Cozma , a Romanian soldier who was brutally murdered by two representatives of the Roma community in Hungary , shows once again that crime does not know the border and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive .
You must ensure the right EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon must represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to concentrate the resources of the Member States in order to achieve optimal results and also in work on common strategies and operations that will also transform Europe into a political union , on which its founders dreamed many years ago .
That is our demand .
All of us , as well as Hungary , are supporters of the single market from the outset .
turbulent climate change is forcing the public and the European Union &apos;s economy to accept a new reality .
Some countries will continue to promote internal stability and help find socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
This was excellent cooperation over three years and , as is usually the case with short linkages , I am pleased that it has come to an end .
The need for NATO to be constantly vigilant and to receive support , especially in Afghanistan , is now vital .
However , something needs to happen , and we will have to move this process forward .
In this context , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , exemption from the system , the possibility of a maximum rate and , last but not least , the imposition of a tax on internal supplies in the EU will have to be addressed .
Let me say a few things about the West Midlands : we have the largest youth unemployment and our car industry was completely destroyed , partly because the funding of the European Union &apos;s jobs in Slovakia deprived important jobs for the Ryton plant .
It is important to ensure that these blind institutions are not imposed weak or damaging framework for reforming the financial sector .
At last , there is a great deal .
We must foster the establishment of a network of research centres that could share specialised infrastructures and ensure the exchange of useful information and data .
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of setting up a European asylum support office because the situation in third countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , is constantly deteriorating .
Mr Severin described this strategic reciprocity very well , namely , that Europe needs a strong United States , but the US needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what proportion of this flow of refugees can be included in this resettlement programme in proportion to that .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do everything in their power to abolish the visa requirement with these countries .
After all , what happened did not discover the food inspector or the EU &apos;s food safety agency , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we should use our vision of military capabilities , by placing the emphasis on soft power and prevention , to get to the new agenda , on the agenda that had already existed in the past , but it was really clear in Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policy allows us to move to a new era of disarmament negotiations .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present a report this evening on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon ; this report was drafted long ago in the Committee on Budgets .
On September , the members of the French Democratic MoDem Party ( Mom ) did not vote for the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , because his performance was not so brilliant to recommend that he be elected for a second time .
By reforming agricultural policy in such a way as to respect the principle that prevention is better than cure , we can guarantee that appropriate animal welfare is at the centre of the focus , that the conditions of rearing animals are in line with their species and that animals are strong and healthy .
Now we are afraid that , by extending the scope of this directive , it is exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; Made in &apos; marking of origin - will be stopped by the Council again .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in calling on politicians , Member States and the European Union to make an effort to ensure that the economy is recovered with priority for small and medium-sized enterprises .
In countries such as the United Kingdom and the US , with deficits of more than 10 % , significant adjustments will have to be made to restore the sustainability of public finances in these countries .
We should make a distinction between different issues or Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , but I do not think that this would be his duty .
There is obviously no freedom of expression in China either .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from the accusations of wine-making , which follow quality policy , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise by-products produced from the mixing of finished products and to allow misleading reference to rosé wine .
However , there is still a huge amount of work to be done .
It will be the case that there will be a reduction in jobs in Europe &apos;s rural areas and in the production capacity of food products .
Let us remember that , despite these institutional questions , the Swedish Presidency is , of course , influencing the need to focus on climate change , the financial crisis and Europe &apos;s concern over the need to develop policies for job creation - these are more important issues to address .
However , I would like to stress that we are well aware that many of the documents needed by police and judicial cooperation will have to be given a new basis enabling Parliament to fulfil its duty as colegislator .
I would also like to commend the rapporteurs for not having raised the ethical issue , which will therefore remain a matter for the Member States .
This is a good thing because , ultimately , it is young people who will determine the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must remember those people who have already made a significant contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we are building an Economic Recovery Plan in which we are selling three and a half billion energy girls to the oligarchy of energy giants and no single euro to partners whose assistance we need to move to green energy .
Fishing quotas and the management of stocks are vital to preventing the total overspending of fisheries resources in inland waters and in the oceans .
We would have liked Parliament &apos;s resources to have been increased , not by increasing the general budget , but by making appropriations transfers and measures to improve efficiency .
Moreover , this package could show how the European institutions can cooperate responsibly , effectively and constructively in such an important area .
I believe that focusing on the first &apos; front &apos; services - which the Commission is proposing for the recast of the directive - in other words , improving the first instance procedures will allow us to achieve economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and we have succeeded at first reading in agreeing on rules on animal by-products .
We do not want European work to be carried out on foreign services in countries where the level of environmental requirements is not the same as us .
The entire contribution was useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
The Presidency must work hard to achieve understanding among the 27 Member States , demonstrate Europe &apos;s unity and readiness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration .
Madam President , as Vice-Chair of the European Parliament for democracy and human rights , I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is , without doubt , one of the sectors of the economy with the highest development potential .
At the time , money was earmarked for only two types of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere , i.e. carbon capture and storage ( OUU ) projects and wind growers in the North Sea .
If the money from the EGF were proposed for redundancies in Britain , we would vote in favour of it and we would be criticised if it did not .
As far as the Court is concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational , but is still in its initial phase .
This is the case for our neighbours , and it covers our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Mollavia , as well as further neighbours like Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Like my colleagues in the Commission , I am committed to integrating the gender equality aspect into all the policies that we will develop .
These projects will help to eliminate the disparities in connections between systems within the European Union and enable the European Union to make further optimistic use of its energy sources .
Moreover , this is a results-based approach to the action plan , and I think that Europe needs , above all , more action plans , and it is certainly one of our responsibilities as Parliament as well .
There is also the case with the failure of FIFA to implement the gateway technology , although this has already been done in other forms of sport .
After all , we are able to organise various training and seminars in which we can provide real assistance for accessing EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas .
There are also Members who use such a lack of policy as a pretext to justify their bilateral dealings with suppliers - transactions which often fail to comply with the requirements of transparency and fair competition , let alone European solidarity .
Furthermore , I am pleased by the fact that we have also succeeded in building a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative planning .
In particular , it should be noted that many Member States have made significant efforts to meet the requirements of the Pact .
The aim is to allow the EU to create solutions to the major societal challenges posed by the Member States &apos; package , which cannot be solved separately ( demographic ageing and health , energy , water and food supply , sustainable development , the fight against climate change , etc . ) , and to develop knowledge that enables our businesses to develop innovations better and improve their competitiveness .
Although we will support this resolution tomorrow , I think there are some contradictions in this budget , and I would like to emphasise two , in my opinion , key points of this .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will look at the issues relating to global economic governance , particularly the Financial Regulation and timely measures relating to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to explore this in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market .
The fundamental issue is the desire of Europeans not to accept any more the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would , in any case , arise as a result of accession .
It is a disgraceful , complex role .
This is our list of priorities at the very beginning .
However , EU aid is essential to ensuring the country &apos;s independence .
The Israeli Government , with increased pressure , continues to colonise , and this is happening after the war crimes at the beginning of this year .
The evaluations and follow-up teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Closure of the sitting
Portugal still has 5 trucks of fishing boats , just as before .
increasing the budget in these areas and creating new military capacity that will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would also like to highlight the contradiction between the promises made by the government of Pakistan in the area of religious freedom and its leading role in the Organisation of Islamic States by approving the &apos; UN Religious Elimination &apos; agenda .
I have emphasised this this this afternoon because it is a fair opinion of mine .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is acceptable , as it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , swift and coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions to introduce programmes for the scrapping of old cars is absolutely necessary , given the constant reduction in sales prices , financial assistance and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is the right one , but it seems to be not too consistent with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which is now going to be a combination of the two pillars &apos; shared roles and powers .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , that is the question &apos; .
If fishermen working on fisheries , from fishermen to traders who sell fish to consumers , then it is doomed to fail .
The cultivation of this Parliament &apos;s expensive , futile empty islands , which are disguised as a complex illusion of democracy , the absurd deceit of voters who have sent us here .
It was a pity that we should be united on this issue .
We no longer say that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe if , to a certain extent , we do not care about it , because the climate issue must be a priority .
The burden of debt - painful evidence we are witnessing - is hampering economic growth , not only in European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this report will make it possible to clarify the various air agreements and to process them in the simplest possible way , and it establishes which criteria we must focus on and which aspects must be monitored .
I will vote in favour of the telecommunications package , but I will do so somewhat unwillingly , because I believe that at the highest level there has been a great deal of dedication on the basic principle of the liberalisation of the telecommunications market , which was to be achieved by this directive .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are going through an unprecedented crisis .
They will have more influence and lower costs for taxpayers if we are able to coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is developing guidance in which Belarusians will be granted easier EU visas and an readmission agreement .
Let me give a concrete example .
Let us look , for example , at bringing up children and schools .
Neither is it known so far whether these standards in the area of legal trade in timber will enter into force and will work globally - some speakers have already mentioned this problem .
It is essential to establish the Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis as an institution to analyse and assess the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States in order to support sustainable and high quality growth .
in writing . - I voted for the modification of the rules on vaccination against bluetongue to allow for more effective vaccines to be used to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on farmers .
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for a strong and integrated EU policy .
Bearing in mind , I wanted to express my deepest disappointment at the results of the meeting , which was well below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payments often cause difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need policies based on budgetary responsibility and discipline , no one disputes this , but we should not insist that all efforts be made by the citizens , because they are the only way they can we get out of this crisis much stronger .
An early warning system has been introduced for this in the United States .
One such case is the constituent of my constituency , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must all stand up for our rights , our freedom and our democracy .
Rather the process : this is what Europeans asked for when they elected this Parliament , and that is what we must do for them if , in five years &apos; time , we want them to take part in the elections in greater numbers .
The parts of the text that fall within the remit of the European Council were discussed and agreed on by the European Council itself .
Private final consumption increased by more than 80 % over the last ten years .
At this point , I believe that it would be useful to work effectively to find the right methods for implementing the legislation in force .
The conclusions of the summit are very weak in this regard .
This proposal therefore proposes uniform acts that allow for implementation or precautionary measures to avoid the problems of identification and translation of instruments coming from other Member States and the standard form of notification of documents related to these claims on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget as they take into account the main political areas and individual opinions .
The Commission can support European cooperation between Member States through financial programmes .
For example , with the decisions of the Council of 13 June and 8 May 2002 , Member States were given the power to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level to bring these crimes to justice , which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinočeta - in some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy gravy train &apos; either .
Our purchases are becoming increasingly remote and the Internet has now changed our habits completely , partly because our lives are becoming increasingly turbulent .
As far as the information is concerned , we are continually providing information when we receive it .
In conclusion , I would like to say that the best contribution is investment in education for the young generation , and by that I mean lifelong learning .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that , in the final agreement with the Council , these issues have been satisfactorily resolved .
( Applause from the centre left )
Thousands of people are involved in this , often with small children and without adequate means .
Procedures are completely different if the question is submitted to the Commission under the next treaty , or if the question is submitted to Parliament under the petitions procedure .
Human rights must be respected by all parties to the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has asked questions about our ability to maintain stability in the euro area .
We must all assume our responsibilities .
We understand that UNESCO has , in any case , made representations to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of reconstruction on Kashgar &apos;s traditional heritage and culture .
in writing . - MEP , Mr Schwab , has proposed a report aimed at improving the safety of vehicles by introducing enhanced safety requirements for vehicle manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
We were severely affected by the economic and financial crisis , but we have shown that we are capable of taking action and have become more resistant .
If we are talking about Parliament &apos;s position on external organisations , such as human rights organisations that may be affected , and if we fail to reach an agreement , although I hope that this will not happen , and if some projects cannot be implemented , I think that Parliament &apos;s position will then gain support and understanding .
These Thursday afternoon sittings in this Parliament are becoming increasingly surreal , both in terms of the gap and in terms of the type of issues to be examined and in which we consider them .
I believe that it is still not entirely clear whether Moldova will be able to elect its President , and if this does not happen , there will obviously be new elections next year .
in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 1 January 1999 , the Economic and Monetary Union was established , and 11 Member States of the European Union introduced the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to express my support and welcome the present compromise , because it raises the democratic deficit that women in particular have had to face for years , helping self-employed men in trade , craftspeople in small and medium-sized enterprises and in the liberal professions , and their work has not been recognised for years .
Of course , our political choices are clearly different and sometimes contradict each other .
I would call it climate justice because it relates to relations between developing countries and to the desire to make a credible proposal for financing measures related to climate change adaptation and mitigation , and also to what example we are setting .
I would therefore also like to know the Commission &apos;s position on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid granted to the banks that benefited from aid , but did not take a proper social approach .
I have three children , but also a young child who is taking a milk to date .
We are ready to develop the technical assistance programmes that will direct the tough austerity measures that the Greek authorities will have to take .
We look forward to the Commission doing so .
As you mentioned , we need to constantly update statistical data , and Eurostat is attempting to do so .
Sometimes , I think we have not learned enough from the consequences of our action if we do not tackle European problems and try to find something specific , even though we have to deal with them all together .
Electronic letters also reveal the fact that scientists who are sceptical about this hypothesis are excluded from the process of revising the research carried out by other scientists in order to prevent research from opening up public scrutiny .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has highlighted this very dark section of society that we are still struggling with and struggling with .
We know what kind of thing we do with people , so the authorities need to be aware of the increased risk and tighter checks .
Our priority during the work on revising the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and for electronic equipment intended for sales in the European Union .
Preventive work is carried out mainly in schools , because this social group is the most vulnerable to drug addiction .
It has succeeded in extending its way to bring the continent together again at the end of the Cold War , and now it is called upon to preserve past achievements and to continue integration until a better time comes .
Many Members would like to have answers to their questions this evening and , if they are suffering , we would like to look at this in the order that is foreseen .
But we who were involved in this process know that there was no alternative and that there were problems with milk to resolve ; it is to be hoped that we are now coming close to resolving some of the problems in this sector .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity rules , we have chosen to abstain from such references in this report , because we oppose the kind of family policy dictated at European level ; this is an issue that must be decided upon by national governments .
Last but not least , I believe that the forthcoming negotiations on this subject should include the issue of EUBAM Rafa : how to restore the mission and how it could be extended .
Thus , the Commission is monitoring the situation and , if necessary , the Commission will act , but I believe that we should not go beyond Community legal structures , and the Commission will certainly remain within the framework of Community law .
Since we all want to see a genuine European diplomatic service and not a carpet for the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we will be discussing today and which we will vote on tomorrow , are particularly important .
in writing . - Given the difference between the employment rate of women and men , pay and access to senior positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national law .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try and get the Commissioner &apos;s assurance that there will now be no further action in the next few weeks unless these refugees are issued .
We will be addressing this shortly during the debate on the first revision of the railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The report by the special committee on the financial , economic and social crisis was adopted today , Wednesday 20 October .
There is already talk of higher taxes in the near future in order to keep public finances above water .
Now is the time for us to persevere in our demand to allow Christians and non-religious people to freely practise their religion .
Throughout the entire territory of the EU , 31.5 % of women work part-time jobs ( 30 hours or less a week ) compared with only 8.3 % of men who work in this way .
I share both the Commissioner and the Minister &apos;s cautious optimism and feel that the debits are clear , but there are still many clouds .
At that time , only the rare of us could have envisaged the scale of the forthcoming economic crisis .
Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction , which shows that it supports consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this comprehensive report .
This policy has become an important element in the European Economic Recovery Package , with added value and support the promotion of modernisation and sustainable growth , thereby showing European solidarity at the same time .
It is also unfortunate that we do not know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , and we must definitely make sure that it comes into force without further doubts .
However , I think that this situation clearly demonstrates the huge difficulties of the agricultural sector , particularly in my region , where farmers have to queue for days on winter months to try to secure the modest amounts of EU funding for themselves .
The Member States of southern Europe left it for time , which is too late .
To achieve this , smart , sustainable and inclusive growth must be ensured in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will be expressing our views in a democratic vote , so tomorrow will be very important .
It has to be said that providing a home is absolutely necessary for everyone , especially in today &apos;s prosperity countries .
In my opinion , setting the political priorities means that they should be thoroughly investigated , and they should be transparent and democratic .
This particular project concerns the introduction of a system of traffic management .
( HU ) In recent months , the feeling of concern in the north of Serbia has once again taken over the several nationalities there , mostly Hungarians .
The text we will vote on today is the result of the compromise - sometimes difficult compromise - and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and other rapporteurs on our behalf have achieved a practical and workable result .
in writing . - Whilst we agree with those parts of the proposal that are aimed at equal treatment between Parliament and the Council for access to meetings and information , regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on the question of the citizens &apos; initiative , the assessment of the impact of the law and the application of the recommendation ( not the repressive law ) , but we do not agree that the compulsory deadline for its approval and reinforcement of the directives for officials and the European Union is being praised for public office ?
You all know that broadcasting cannot be provided without access to the radio spectrum , and EU policy provides for all market players with no discrimination in access to the radio spectrum .
This will ensure the general and quite comprehensive action plan that will be drawn up by the Commission , with regard to the success of equality between men and women in the areas to which my fellow Member has just referred , from employment to other aspects where it is important to ensure and guarantee such equality .
We expect other political and economic heavy weight to put forward proposals that some of them have not yet done .
Dementia , especially Alzheimer &apos;s , is not only a serious medical problem , but also a highly sensitive ethical and social problem , which will become increasingly serious in the context of an ageing European population .
I would also like to say that you have placed particular emphasis on not confusing the various responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to confuse the responsibility that lies with the Member States , with what is the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs , who have been going into the details of this matter in detail : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have come up with our hand in full support of all the European institutions - in other words , accepting it - Minsk , Minsk , Minsk and the Belarusian people will gain a great deal of it .
We must monitor very closely what is happening , because the President pointed out that European companies would save us EUR 38 billion each year .
Now , after the ruling of Liu Xiaobo , we have even witnessed the ban by the police on the posting of homosexuals , which is clearly threatening the entry of the political fratric with Chinese dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today was very clear .
We must acknowledge here that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved , because only through the parliaments can the majority of regulations be adopted , and that this process and proposals for Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are extremely important .
Someone mentioned helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am very pleased to see you here and to hear your speech .
That is what I wanted to emphasise in the context of this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a strong message to women who help their spouses .
Anyone who has been in Gaza following the conflict can see the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , from a strategic point of view , the most important thing for the European Union is relations with the United States .
I have to say that our aim is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe is unable to do more and better if it has less funding at its disposal .
At the same time , the large number of participants in Copenhagen gives hope that the objective , which is shared by so many allies , will ultimately prove successful .
Mr President , I would like to support the motion for there to be no resolution , because I have heard Mr Schulz say something that I think is very important : if we really want this debate to be about &apos; Europe &apos; and not just Italy , then it makes no sense to vote on the resolution entitled &apos; freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report .
This Parliament &apos;s recommendation proposes that the regulation proposed by the Council be approved and that it should no longer be delayed , because the new regulation would simplify the administration of the processes and guarantee equal treatment of social security for third country residents residing legally in the EU .
This is an alarming small figure , and I have mentioned this in my report that I drafted during the previous term of office .
However , EU policy on the Arctic is not as strange as the appointment of Baroness Ashton , a former left-wing student Sarah Palin , as High Representative .
One such achievement is the free trade agreement concluded with South Korea on 6 October , which is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement that the European Union has ever signed , and which must continue to be a qualitative criterion when concluding future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote for the Conservative amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that it is necessary to reduce it , and their position is a weak starting point for negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I think that we have attached too little importance to developing new types of cars , to cars with hydrogen , to batteries or to fuel elements .
Let us go all the way .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me first thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand , the European Union is ready , as far as possible , to support the country in this difficult process .
In order to ensure that this derogation , which allows for the creation of jobs and welfare , really benefits the local population and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries , it was essential to make an assessment of the impact of this derogation as soon as possible and to allow it to be lifted if necessary .
That is what the Commission and the Council are doing very much now to ensure that gas supplies are restored as soon as possible ; threatening legal action is not , of course , very effective .
It is necessary that the Member States do not hesitate to investigate the extreme human rights violations against Roma women , the perpetrators of the penalty , and ensure that all the victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a fairly complicated issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies and also - we have not spoken about this - with the national parliaments , and particularly with the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee , the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
My recommendation to you is , please , now that , when the European External Action Service introduces rules on access to information and documents , do so as being a modern body that is available to citizens and that does not confine itself to foreign policy , as if it were merely a sphere of secret diplomacy .
All the countries are now amending their economic policy in order to overcome the adverse economic situation as soon as possible and start a slight economic growth .
I , too , would like to say something to you about the Japanese people .
That was what Mr Barroso replied on .
We are therefore among those who believe that this should not be weakened , but rather that it should be maintained and strengthened .
It is no secret that our European identity has been born out of direct Christian tradition .
If it is useful for the big corporations , it is changing public transport and responsible for deteriorating the network and for reducing its safety .
On the other hand , discussions on Turkey &apos;s membership of the EU cannot be sidelined in future .
This risk must be managed effectively , and it must be done urgently , as the tragic events in Japan remind us .
The main aim of the agreement is to ensure better protection for workers against the risk of being subjected to sharp or severe instruments used in medicine .
In short , I will probably conclude my report this evening , but neither I nor the European institutions have yet finished their work on this issue .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and stress that my political group very cautiously treated the approval of SIS II from the very beginning on many issues related to data protection .
The rules must be properly applied .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman has recorded a total of 3098 complaints which , compared to the 3406 complaints recorded in 2008 , amount to 9 % less .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities also clearly rejected forced retirement in its October ruling , reaching the retirement age .
EGNOS and GNSS can make a significant contribution to the objectives of safety and environmental protection , and to freer traffic flow in road transport if this system is applied to the collection of road tolls .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for almost one third of the budget , the situation is that this is the only area where the estimated error is higher than 5 % .
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the report that has been tabled , which has the support of the majority .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of resolving the crisis through a green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , is to allow large companies to make new profitable industries rather than protecting the environment and meet the needs of the grassroots classes .
I therefore share your concern that such important objectives of the Hungarian Presidency may distort the national debate or the peculiarities rather than the one that unites us .
I agree with the cost cover , in accordance with the conditions agreed in the past , in the case of basic and precisely defined cases where cross-border healthcare includes at least one nights of patient residence in a hospital and a specific specialised and costly medical facility , or there is a specific risk to the patient or to the population at all .
The most important way of managing our leadership would have been to pursue an even greater target of a 30 % reduction in emissions .
The abusive use of evil is particularly damaging to those who are making genuine efforts to minimise the environmental damage .
The previous visa scandals show , of course , how relaxed the access to the issuing of visas in some countries is .
Once again , the rural population , which is sorely needed , has been abandoned to its fate .
I know that you are able to withstand these challenges .
Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
Orbán did not convince the groups represented in the European Parliament of his own as a European politician seeking unanimity and compromise , but as a &apos; champion &apos; , which used the attacked populist and nationalistic tone , &apos; protects the Hungarian people from &apos; attacks &apos; .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I therefore welcome this report positively and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to make an atomic bomb .
I am totally opposed to the idea of prevention bombing and to NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for achieving European stability .
( IT ) Mr President , the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important part of the work that enables us to establish a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
In view of this , it is our duty to establish the conditions to ensure the sustainability and long-term development of the fisheries sector .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic region are harsh , but there is also no doubt that the area of new technology and progress will inevitably be opened up to the greater exploitation of natural resources , on which fisheries will play a key role .
Youth unemployment rates at the start of this year amounted to 20 % as a result of the economic crisis , while premature training for young people reached 17 % , mostly in rural areas .
Nowadays , there is a huge number of environmental labels , images and texts on the market that can confuse consumers , from forest images , containing hazardous substances , until demand for non-carbon buildings and even green cars .
in writing . - We did not support this proposal , as it would mean the plight of the undeveloped Third World to impose responsibility on European countries , not on these very countries .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for wasting the time for all of us and delaying lunch , but I do so only once in ten years , so perhaps you will allow me that .
This is a particularly fine job ; the essence of this work is to change things to the best , and she lacks sufficient experience .
We agreed to abolish these rules only last year and , although consumers have not experienced much difference , our producers have experienced it and are still feeling it .
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , because they are aimed solely at saving and restricting the social rights of citizens .
We must not allow the budget for the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) to be reduced , as this could mean that agriculture is probably less worthy of Europe .
However , the early closure of such a huge business involves huge and indirect costs according to economic calculations .
I therefore sincerely wish to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the compromise proposal that has been agreed .
Prime Minister of the Republic of Latvia , distinguished Valdi Zatler , is very pleased to all of us for the opportunity to welcome you today at your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then there was some drama .
If a third country through which illegal immigrants can enter into is a treaty and a readmission agreement is concluded that aims to strengthen the European Union &apos;s agreement with this third country , which is the general approach and philosophy of the European Pact , is thus strengthened .
We maintain that the report does not fully take into account our suggestion , but we welcome the fact that it has conclusions that are very close to our times .
Given that promoting a more competitive system in an open global trade environment is one of the responsibilities entrusted to President Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I will use the Commissioner &apos;s presence in plenary to ask him how he assesses his cooperation with my colleague responsible for agriculture by concluding the Doha Round .
The report proposes simplifying financial supervision and monitoring and strengthening the technical and scientific assessment through a comparative review of the peer review based on excellence .
The proposals put forward today should be considered , analysed and understood in such a context .
The legal and administrative obstacles ( legal subjectivity , financing rules and sometimes intellectual property ) should also be noted , which could prevent many important research stakeholders from participating .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will review Directive 2007 / 52 in accordance with the points it has just outlined .
That is also why I voted for the rules that highlight corporate social responsibility .
We see that work on the new point that we worked on together , namely the question of transparency , has progressed relatively slowly and has actually fallen , even if we look at any standards , because of the new regulations on access to documents , with the opportunity for those who led infringement proceedings or requested them to start to find out why they have been dropped or got them off .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Mr Tannock , I would like to say that this is not the first time that we have debated the terrible human rights situation in Burma here in this Parliament , which unfortunately has always been a teeth .
It is therefore a public task to act so that women and men can freely choose one of these two logic , for which both have cause to exist , from the perspective of perspective beyond the perspective of work .
Nowadays , it promotes consumption of products with reduced nutritional value , leaving thousands of livestock farmers who are unable to sell their produce in a country that produces 50 % of their demand in a precarious situation .
The full impact of the current situation on the development of our portfolio and our business cannot yet be seen clearly .
In the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is important today as always - and perhaps even more important than ever .
Fossil fuels create a centralised , hierarchical and inflexible distribution of energy .
In this regard , I agree with what has been said by my colleagues .
( HU ) Madam President , the EU Hungarian Presidency is at half a time , so it is worth reviewing what has been achieved so far .
I believe that the first revision of the railway package must identify the problems faced by Member States , which have received a reasoned opinion from the Commission , along with the method for resolving them .
Israel is unaware that such a disproportionate military response encourages other suicide bombers and Qasin to take the first opportunity .
The Burmese authorities continue to ignore the protests against Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s imprisonment , as well as the call for his release by many countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , ASEAN and a number of ASEAN Member States .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
Rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , we were told that the assurances provided by the EU budget reached almost EUR 20 billion for EIB operations at the end of 2009 , a large amount even for the European Union , so I think Parliament quite rightly expects clarification on the risks of this obligation .
Unfortunately , the Finland project has already been approved , but on behalf of Timo Soini and myself , I would like to ask where the information about the project that citizens of all the Baltic Sea countries need before they start construction work .
But this decision would not have entered into force without active participation by the Czech Republic .
I think it is important to have an information campaign on this issue .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to ensure that Kosovo &apos;s citizens &apos; identity card documents have been checked .
In this area , too , action has been taken and clear and precise rules have been introduced .
Does they agree with Mr Corbett &apos;s vision of a federal European United States or with the less close vision of a free trade Europe supported by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , for the quality of the report she is presenting today .
This is not impunity : impunity is when you allow a situation of this kind to continue for years , as you are doing - like you , who are doing nothing for years - to change this situation and consider ourselves to be unjustifiable .
Often , people with so many good points cannot be encountered .
I firmly believe that all in Slovenia will support such a stress test being conducted immediately in Krško .
It does not augur well that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit on Thursday .
We have seen that much has been done to meet the criteria , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet the requirements as soon as possible .
Under these circumstances , it seems cynical to allow the Moldovan Government to force its citizens to finance dubious European programmes and agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the new generation of air traffic management ( SESAR ) , without Moldova being a member of the European Union .
This would mean firing two birds with one stone , because this infrastructure would stimulate the European economy and provide jobs and , at the same time , minimise the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit , Khanty-Mansisk agreed that our common objective is to have a strategic agreement that will provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations in the foreseeable future and help develop the potential of our relations .
It is now clear that , with regard to the situation in the Mediterranean and Libya in particular , we are still not fulfilling the requirements ; we need a little more protracted reflection to realise that it will probably be necessary to take more robust action to understand what has happened and for the Mediterranean to act in a coordinated manner .
The significant EU funding for this project was provided provided provided that it is supported by the local population and that the funding is also provided by private Italian investments .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , a report was published on the EU accession process in the Balkan countries .
We therefore also abstained on the vote on the proposals by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on matters relating to TV1 in Portugal , although we know that the Portuguese Communist Party is criticising the Portuguese situation .
The Committee on Development proposed the introduction of a system of reporting , under which international companies should report on a country by country individually .
The main problem referred to in the report is prostitution and the trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to speak to you directly .
I approved the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , even if Mladić and Hadžić are detained , the judicial process will not be completed .
Likewise , I call on the Commission to support the fraught farmers &apos; demand for damages to be remunerated to the companies they are guilty , because these farmers were unaware of their cattle .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve the European Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find a solution , we must take the same approach in future .
But you know that our message includes structural reforms ; structural reforms to increase Europe &apos;s growth potential and the capacity to create European jobs are undoubtedly important .
Against the backdrop of the current financial crisis , this partnership can play a key role in opening up new opportunities for trade , scientific advances and the exchange of new technologies , enabling us to emerge from the crisis even more forcefully and consistently .
We cannot tolerate inaction any more .
in writing . - The approval of the Treaty of Lisbon and then the entry into force of the Treaty mean increasing Parliament &apos;s responsibilities , as well as the resulting administrative burden .
In this period of unprecedented crisis , with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that Europe &apos;s unemployed or poor workforce do not exceed 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like once again to emphasise the importance of the written declaration that I , together with four of my fellow Members , proposed in the fight against corruption , which was approved by the European Parliament with a single voice , with the aim of entrusting the Council and the Commission to produce legislation that would be truly effective in the fight against corruption .
Mr President , President of the President of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports your programme for Parliament and for Parliament &apos;s work over the next five years .
Let us allow it to implement these promises in the name of democracy .
We believe that only through such a dialogue will we be able to help these countries , in particular , by encouraging the participation of civil society .
As a socialist , I believe that the partisan war in Sri Lanka will not solve the problem ; the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
This is the right time to support simpler and cheaper measures for SMEs , which will , of course , enable the creation of more jobs and more growth .
In combating this phenomenon , it is very important to adopt common security measures in the European Union , including with regard to transformation .
As far as group claims are concerned , there is always a question of the US and its experience and extremes .
If the EU &apos;s extradition and legal assistance requests were to enter into force soon , this would be an incentive for cooperation in criminal law , as well as for the elimination of a grey sphere , resulting in the possibility of extraordinary rendition .
I have three proposals , and I would like to ask very clearly for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been asked many times to decide on whether sport is a public service or , on the contrary , it also has economic aspects stipulating that sport is a service of general economic interest .
I think that the protection of EU citizens is a top priority in this institution , and citizens must know that .
Only time will this prove to be a serious problem or will the directive &apos;s unquestionably positive impact prevail .
Modernising the logic of goods transport and promoting co-modality , namely the combination of different modes of transport into the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to contribute to the well-being of the Baltic Sea region .
The Member States must decide in a democratic process whether they want to ratify the existing International Labour Organisation Convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , a minimum monthly income in the various Member States fluctuated from EUR 123 in Bulgaria and EUR 157 to EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
It is also likely that the text adopted as a result will be unreprehensible .
The Copenhagen Summit was disappointing in many respects .
We call on international donors , national and non-governmental organisations to suspend their activities in certain areas if the draft legislation is adopted .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of the individual , and one that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you , Mr President .
Václav Havel has told us today that Europe is our homeland .
Thus , if I address the police in Hungarian in Slovakia , he should reply in Slovak , even if Hungarian is his mother tongue , and also despite the fact that I do not understand his reply .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like once again to look at one of the aspects of transatlantic cooperation in the area of police and justice with regard to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , that is , the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the US .
We saw a worrying increase in the use of various national remedies , both in individual Member States and in developing countries .
In the case of SWIFT , the Commission and the Council have not taken any serious account of this .
Finally , in political terms , it is important for us to have a Union with the ACP countries in the World Trade Organisation .
We need to do something else .
If we can help to bring together the abandoned bases and family , which yearn for children , we will have made a very important contribution .
Since it is important for the 2020 strategy to be a success , I would like to talk in particular about how important it is that the various EU institutions stop fighting against each other and that we develop serious cooperation on instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU strategy for humanitarian aid .
The terrible events in Gaza must also make us look at Gaza in a more strategic and long-term manner .
There is a need to develop other indicators that would help us to understand which factors affect the standard of living in the country .
According to medical professionals , treatment with the right medicines can be delayed by the need to introduce a person with this disease in an expensive care facility for a year .
The Entrepreneurship and Industry , Mr Tajani , have committed himself to finding out the losses in this sector .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package comprises four draft decisions intended to implement the Council decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is largely a vote on the reputation of the European Parliament .
In the turbulent global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union must increase its strategic autonomy to uphold its values , implement its interests and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by pooling its resources and opportunities to respond adequately , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
This is a good time in these two relations , and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This will be a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , and I hope that it will contribute to improving the legitimacy of the European project among the public .
I invite you to read the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for an active position .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance and coordination of budgetary positions and the surveillance and economic policy - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
However , if we want to be successful , we must also support this with strong and determined political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I warn you .
I would like to see them set out by setting a specific deadline or by setting out certain criteria , regardless of how they are structured , and maybe the Commission can consider what proposals they may make to meet India &apos;s requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I have heard the Italian Prime Minister being accused of completely displaying everything , without mentioning that tens of thousands of people are being assured to work thanks to his business .
Whether this is done in time or not is , of course , an issue that should be assessed by Parliament itself .
This report therefore emphasises the uncertain role of the programme in calling for changes to be made to overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations , as well as the weak successes , and as a result of which this programme is still too indispensable for small and medium-sized enterprises at a time when they play an important role in transforming research results into goods and services , and the Paul &apos;s call for better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders at a time when public funding is still being split up between the European Union .
In fact , in the Greek crisis , it is not independent ; it has chosen to side by side with .
This will not reduce the competitiveness of our industries .
He insisted on a global ban on so-called &apos; cluster body scanners &apos; .
The statistics show that every year , cardiovascular diseases cause around 4.3 million deaths in Europe , with more than 1.7 million people dying of cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective measure of protecting public health in order to protect European citizens from infectious diseases , but it is also important for healthcare to be reached by developing countries , contributing to an increase in life expectancy and to combating poverty .
We must therefore say loudly : if the banks use these new rules , introduced in the euro area to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens , that is clearly nonsense .
We in this economic situation , and even more so in the European Parliament , must definitely ensure that expenditure is under control .
I therefore believe that improving the protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential to Europe &apos;s competitiveness .
He played a very important role in observing all proceedings in the Supreme State Security Court and assessed detention conditions in Syria on a regular basis .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters , as well as better interoperability and coordination of the various Community instruments .
It seemed at the time that all the new Member States would respect the fundamental principles and non-discrimination of the EU , and would protect and respect the linguistic diversity of languages and the rights of national minorities .
Not only has there been a reduction in financial credit , but also a social credit .
These new measures will help European citizens and businesses to exercise their rights , especially as regards the recognition of qualifications or their social and residence rights .
The issue of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not something that is once given and forgotten .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue with its environmental impact assessment with a view to preparing , if necessary , the EU legislative proposal on biological waste by 2010 .
The fact is this : in the first days following the introduction of the child into the family , men are entitled to play a full part in parenting .
This is what the assessment deserves , not criticism , even though it is not central at the moment .
The reality is that we in the EU must reduce our inevitable dependence on Russia &apos;s energy .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 1th largest trading partner , and in 2010 , trade relations between the European Union and Canada represented 1.6 % of the EU &apos;s total external trade .
I would like to start by pointing out that Marylène Renault , not myself , was the rapporteur who introduced this procedure into our Rules of Procedure .
The fishing industry in this country remains completely undeveloped .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate , we are discussing four reports , which is why first of all I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the work they have done and the European Commission for their cooperation .
I agree that the summit is an important event .
This regulation will make the rules on cabotage applicable - and I refer here in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - uniformly and unbureaucratic across the EU without affecting existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama has said that he is calling on China to examine documents in the archives of his government in exile so that they can assure themselves that he has not incited violence .
This is their response to the question , which has prevented their development and integration into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
We face many demagogic statements every day , both in the media and here in the European Parliament , which have no professional basis whatsoever .
Since human rights are a key element in the EU-Pakistan binding agreement , the proposed trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted for the directive on the energy performance of buildings , as it will have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it will have a direct impact on the buildings in which they live and which they are using .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position , albeit temporary , resignation from the principles on which the European Union is founded , as well as four fundamental freedoms .
But we do not think it is acceptable for Parliament to use this to demand a budget increase .
At last , the time has come to put an end to this unilateral privileged situation being experienced by the US .
Mr Dalli and the Commission , now that we have this directive , I would be pleased if you paid more attention to the regulation on social security , which is the system on which the whole is founded , and which clearly states who is paid and where everything is well organised .
Let us always keep an eye on our common objective and work with the Arctic countries and the international community to find the best and most effective way for future generations to preserve and protect the Arctic .
I think that this was really necessary and is a good example of Parliament &apos;s success in drafting this budget by means of funds which , let us say , have not been used in other areas .
Let us now list the hypotheses .
For this to happen , we will have to do everything we can to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In sensitive sectors such as clothing , leather products and furniture companies that have decided to continue production in Europe while preserving European knowledge and European jobs , it is necessary to create the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has not managed to eradicate this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proven to be an effective foreign policy instrument that promotes the strengthening of relations with third countries , bringing concrete benefits .
Moreover , this is not just a matter for you .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to express its opinion .
However , with this draft document , we have raised the barrier and we have done so because it is necessary to take care of patients .
The Committee on Budgets is aware of the importance and urgency of these proposals .
I believe that all patients have the right to quality care and care provided in their mother tongue , close to their home and their family .
As far as this House is concerned , we must use the terms that are acceptable to everyone , and FYROM , a candidate country , has been approved as FYROM and not as a &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be achieved and it will lead to better results .
The latest changes in the European economy , not only those linked to Greece , have shown that there is an urgent and even urgent need to improve economic governance in Europe .
The donor of these funds , Stuart Wheeler , who said that this would cost GBP 120 billion a year , about 36 times more than in reality .
The double-hatted attitude to Belarus that has been mentioned , namely , the policy of threat and carrots , as Mr Tannock said , seems to be hopefully going to justify this .
We could talk about many other issues for hours : energy , non-proliferation and others , but I think it is important that in all three reports we have this important agreement on what we have recently done in recent times .
Secondly , he also said that the Commission should finally start examining the possibility of introducing Eurobonds .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the law for the protection of minors ( debate )
This is not the credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs )
According to this regulation , tyre suppliers must be used to provide information to users about fuel consumption and refrigeration , wet grip and external rolling noise .
We fully respect the right of each Member State to decide for ourselves whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In this attempt to achieve more courageous and ambitious results , I think that at the end of the COP 16 negotiations , the European Union should also give its main negotiator some flexibility in response to the developments arising from these negotiations .
It is therefore essential to have balanced and transparent measures , because obtaining the confidence of our business people is a prerequisite for the success of this project .
There is a problem with the adverse impact of the excessive urbanisation on the environment , particularly on coastal areas and on the Spanish islands , as well as on other areas , such as the Madrid .
It is important that the special representative of Central Asia , in cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission , is very carefully monitoring the situation .
Such processes should include necessary maintenance and monitoring after shutdown , waste treatment , storage and decontamination , environmental improvement and support for replacing the production capacity of shut-down power stations , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is what I believe .
I come from a country where , whenever I am on a supermarket , I see a man who flies behind a cross .
At this meeting , for example , the issue of selling fertile land to developing countries to countries that do not have arable land , is , in itself , worthy of discussion , which we could find a common solution .
However , there is a need for a trans-European network , because otherwise the European Union &apos;s main objectives will not be met .
In Europe , tobacco grows 17 of the 27 Member States and each of them provides subsidies .
One of the languages - English , French or German - will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout the entire EU .
This is a contentious issue for Ireland , and is one of the reasons for a negative vote on the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Presidency has done everything in its power to reach an agreement , but ultimately it decided that this issue should be decided by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny our opinions differ .
So that is what this Commission is doing .
However , perhaps this was a unique case for moving to the Agency &apos;s long-term house .
The proposed amendments will allow less developed Member States , including Romania , to use this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to listen to so many Members from all political parties in this House praise and rightly so .
I do not particularly need to emphasise the importance of these two issues in the current situation .
We will work together to bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion in 2010 , as this is very important for the recovery and for limiting protectionism .
Ladies and gentlemen , today is a special day for me because , after ten years of service , this was my last session as President here in Brussels .
From the point of view of effectiveness , I also feel an interesting proposal that these delegations will take on certain consular services , for example , to address issues relating to Schengen visas .
It is in the law that we have wasted a great deal of time debating each other rather than having a daily debate with others , and in the end we have received a thorough tyre .
I think that the Commission &apos;s draft needs to be better prepared , and this is why Parliament needs more time to take decisions .
Perhaps there are more ambitious plans than the current ones .
Without the protection of the European Union and its guaranteed protection , it would be much more difficult for all Member States .
As a social democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in overall primary education , poverty reduction and greater access to safe drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso said , with reference to the Treaty of Lisbon , that the Commission is speaking on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
There is a lack of views , they may even differ , even Eurosceptics give the floor , but the result must be one .
Lukashenko , as a skilful politician , has been able to implement his programme of campaign , has exploited all the political and economic advantages and , at the same time , continues to despicate democracy and human rights .
In contrast , in accordance with this same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia expressed the hope to negotiate and conclude local border agreements between Russia and the European Union &apos;s neighbours , which would be interested in signing these agreements .
This depends on the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself talked about the shortcomings that still need to be overcome in introducing legislation in several Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups must admit that people living in the south of Israel have the right to live and not to be bombed .
We must do everything we can to ensure the correct recycling of this waste , not only by being able to prevent environmental and health damage , but also by reducing the loss of raw materials .
I must remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still subject to an international arrest warrant , although the authorities in this country are ignoring this .
This letter has also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send to Parliament a detailed report on the project &apos;s operation in the first year , and preparatory work has already begun .
Mr President , I would have expected you to call to order in your response .
As far as the Directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal fundamentally makes sense as far as the prohibition of products that are harmful to human health and the gradual replacement of products with others are concerned .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to set out the fishing opportunities of European Union vessels on the basis of the surplus fish stocks available , and to provide for a separate financial contribution in exchange for access rights and sectoral support .
We , the EU , must provide all possible assistance both to the new Tunisian Government and to EU citizens , including British citizens , who are in a difficult situation when they are overcrowded by Tunisia on holiday .
Dear fellow Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and proper for the island of Taiwan to be moved to a positive list .
Unfortunately , even in a democratic society , these traditional means of communication often fail on account of commercial interests , or because their leadership belongs to a specific political environment and indirectly force workers to exercise self-censorship .
We cannot coexist in the European Union until such a situation continues , and that is why we believe it is very important that the Commission , the European Union &apos;s institutions and all of us continue to make proposals in the same way to put an end to this situation .
This is one thing , and since I am committed to assessing all legislation in a timely manner , I will also check whether a number of social , environmental and economic criteria have been met .
That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we in the European Parliament are talking about Belarus , but talking is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support and welcome this proposal .
I am pleased that East Jerusalem is regarded as a capital for the future of the Palestinian State , or that Jerusalem could be a shared capital of both countries .
The third lesson we can learn is that the European Union must be ready in the situation .
However , even between regions of one Member State , the important difference is important .
The prevention and eradication of violence against women must set essential strategic objectives for making progress on which our civilisation aspires .
I look forward to hearing your answers .
The rapporteur &apos;s preliminary results from 10 southern countries were announced on 30 January and demonstrated that the majority ( 9.5 % ) in favour of secession .
Personally , I think that Europe needs a common energy policy so that we can avoid over-dependence on the resources of one region .
Moreover , the PVB revealed shortcomings in Brazil &apos;s existing traceability system and found that many shipments that are on the way to the EU do not have the necessary certificates .
Now these committees will have the floor .
I therefore believe that the most important question now is how can we proceed with the Swedish Presidency ?
The role of the European Union must be strengthened as a result of this crisis .
The central element of this proposal is the insistence that this dialogue be reciprocal so that the opinions expressed are taken into account and respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore street and urban names to Polish areas where the majority of the population are Polish minorities .
Since all these measures are interlinked , necessary and compatible with the size of the objectives set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this important result in accordance with the expectations of the citizens as soon as possible .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of this report because it contains significant improvements to the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour .
The aim of this report is to raise the level of risk omission , to simplify bureaucratic supervision mechanisms and to increase confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I support the comments made by Mr Daul .
The resolution adopted today emphasises that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest participation of the various categories of operators , while respecting their differences and specific identities .
As spokesman for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has been busy by watching the events of recent weeks in the Mediterranean , from which many people fleeing the situation in Africa have managed to get to Europe , but many have failed to do so .
However , this is not the case , and the sad example of this is the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel bombed and mass destroys ghetto .
It is important to hear people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The CAP and global food security are important issues .
I would like to thank you for your constructive and far-sighted debate .
This partnership must be based on mutual respect , respect for shared obligations , and respect for the values expressed by the European Union in terms of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
The motor industry accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
Firstly , in this area , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled amendments calling for the total elimination , in the near future , of all types of export subsidies , and , as the Commission is well aware , this is not only about Europe , but also about the United States .
Most supporters stress the need to either focus or focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture , to respond to climate change , to food safety and quality requirements and to other environmental objectives .
We also believe that negotiations for an agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit , which is to take place in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , very important for the European Union to increase specific subsidies for cities , as they have the greatest potential in the economic and financial spheres , since they have been particularly hard hit by the urban crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Budgetary Control is not formally familiar with the Court &apos;s report by next week .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , as scientists recommend that we stop the destruction of biodiversity , we need major financial resources .
Only the threats and correction that characterise the main dynamics of the accession process can lead their governments to focus on work and making reforms that can once and for all consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans once and for all .
I will talk about two reports because they are very important .
In the interests of the legal certainty of all those involved , it is in the interests of the same rights across Europe for those who have been accused of various infringements , and it is necessary to introduce an obligation of information regarding these rights .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy are areas relating to national sovereignty , which is why we voted against all the reports on this issue .
I am referring , for Mr Weber &apos;s sake , to Article D .
I also welcome the positive assessment given to the continued efforts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened in Greece a few hours ago will not go far enough , and I hope that this will mark , on the contrary , the beginning of a unanimous effort to create a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have contacted people in Tunisia and Egypt every hour , with our delegations , to whom I pay tribute to what they had to do in the last few weeks , and we have also been in direct contact with the government and the services .
In fact , I am convinced that this financial instrument is all the more important in the context of the financial crisis , as it can contribute to a more efficient recovery for businesses and may , in future , become a pilot project for creating a more generous fund for energy supply .
These checks were inadequate .
Then we will be able to make a great deal of European contribution , but that cannot be a dead letter .
I voted in favour of the special report presented by the European Ombudsman to Parliament on the basis of his draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT concerning three excessive delays at times in responding to the Ombudsman in the process of fulfilling his duties .
The main progress made by this directive in comparison with the legislation currently in force is that patients will be able to choose the health-care provider and have access to information on the quality and safety of care they will receive .
I would like to reiterate that the European Commission must be called on to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in a flexible manner and to review the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund in order to adapt them to the needs of tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer protection organisations and with representatives of the business environment , I have realised that we need to stand up for even greater harmonisation of consumer rights at European Union level .
I said that anyone who asked questions is a poor guy in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the obligation to monitor the negotiations - in this case the trade negotiations - and also the political intervention of the parliaments available , such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , so that Parliament is always aware of the progress of these negotiations .
The contribution made by citizens to social cohesion or solidarity between generations is not recognised .
However , genuine reform is based on admissibility .
This is one of the most important human rights issues in the European Union at the moment .
It is therefore necessary to make the appropriate financial resources available , which will allow the European Union to use the opportunities and new sources of global competitiveness .
In many European countries , when public authorities find themselves in a difficult situation , they usually pay late and , as a result , very often , other companies go bankrupt .
At the G20 Summit as one of the most important objectives was to abolish tax havens .
There is no such reaction from the political community .
Of course , the dollar remains a leading currency and a safe contribution , but the enormous debts that have been accumulated by the United States in an attempt to finance them in the rest of the world are becoming increasingly doubtful of the fact that the economic power will be able to fulfil its obligations .
We must ensure that a free society has the tools and measures that can be used to fight against those who want to destroy this society and kill them .
To be clear , Iceland , when it was a rich country , was not interested in joining the European Union .
Vice-President , that is not a new demand .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving all actors in order to ensure a very high level of local admissibility .
However , this is a problem that neighbouring countries and regions will inject to the fight against international terrorism as long as this fight continues in Afghanistan .
We must fight against fragmentation , and I therefore urge Commissioner Andor to keep the whole of the European Social Fund under the implementing rules rather than distributing it , as is sometimes proposed in this House .
It is self-evident , of course , that by reaching a compromise we are not getting everything we want .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and all three rapporteurs - Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug - for their constructive attitude during the budget procedure , which also testifies to our excellent cooperation .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Socialist Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to stress that the negotiations are not endless and would make a more realistic alternative , for example , the preferential partnership .
This is therefore , first and foremost , an American problem that must be resolved in Washington .
I would also like to say that we should introduce a reform whereby European universities are becoming more independent and European , open to students and scientists and creating dynamic development in a knowledge-based society .
Quotas which they are investigating can be kept in the reserve of the state and later distributed if the Member States so wish .
I would therefore like to ask once again that the date of his death day , 25 May , be set as the International Day for the Conspiracy of Totalitarianism , because many unknown people who , like Pilecki , were fighting for fundamental rights and freedoms deserve to be remembered .
Let me briefly tell you what we have done .
If this is the majority opinion in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , the peace plan drawn up after the wars in the Balkans , which has been investing heavily in its implementation , will be broken .
I hope that these changes will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want to manipulate the figures and see how EMAS is competing with the ISO , but because I think this system is a good one and can help us achieve our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker is responsible for Cristian Dan Preda &apos;s question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As many Members have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I think it will be a good thing .
Monetary dumping and the social consequences that such practices entail are , in future , unacceptable .
This aspect is essential to ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
By setting out best practices in the experiences of the Member States and respecting basic standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment , and protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we will have at our disposal a coherent European policy .
I know that in public consultations on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep meat sector have defended mandatory marking of origin .
I am very well aware of the complexity of this issue , Mr Kelly .
Although there are many economic and financial problems in most countries , particular attention must be paid to halting the adverse effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , it must be clear that this report will contribute to a serious parliamentary debate on reforming the own resources system .
Therefore , overall compliance with these measures has been increased .
President of the Commission . - The Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to express its views on the audit process .
The level of fraud in France and Spain , for example , is considered &apos; suspiciously low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solutions and whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to establish a national statistical data exchange network and a coordination platform for research into the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view expressed in Parliament many times that greater European solidarity would improve European and Russian relations .
Syria still has a long way to go to achieve freedom of expression and association .
Much remains to be done to guarantee women a fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal must be reassessed in the light of the rules laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is unstable .
I voted in favour of this report because I wanted to emphasise one particular danger , which is that consumers are not provided with correct and comprehensive information on the composition , origin and characteristics of individual species of fish , and on consumer health implications .
After all , in history , there is no example of Western intervention , which has done more harm than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is useless and incapable of tackling crime prevention for a number of reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a fundamental political event , and unlike what has just been said here , Hamas has agreed for the first time to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority , which acts as its negotiating partner .
The countries catch and negotiate how to divide the sea bed .
Energy is particularly important , especially knowing what the problems of energy infrastructure are , which ...
In other words , it is now the institution that has been set up to protect us from criminal offenders ( indirectly by providing vocational training to police officers ) .
However , the fact that Fidels Kastro gave power to his brother Raule has not led to any democratic reforms or to the release of political prisoners .
Energy performance assessments will be set out in all advertisements that will have information on energy consumption or which will cover product prices .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know the Washington Consensus , you all very much liked that .
We must therefore also , of course , be able to respond appropriately to the real events in the countries with which Frontex is already facing .
I would like to conclude by once again thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We worked with the Czech Presidency on this , and I really appreciate the Presidency &apos;s support for our efforts to find a reasonable solution on the way forward .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s connection with the private enterprise network makes a candidate for ensuring a particularly appropriate balance between EU legislation and market requirements and the specific requirements of European people .
1 000 people have died on this occasion as a result of the conflict in 17 days .
Only if such measures are taken will there be a reduction in the number of falsified medicines and safety improvements in the use of medicines .
We must also learn from Opel : it is not too late to develop a coordinated European strategy for the road transport sector .
We did so because , like you , President Obama and I refuse to choose between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro proposes that wage savings be made as a permanent element .
Recently , at Manchester Airport , there was a new trial , and lawyers have said that the use of these machines for a minor inspection of these machinery could be a breach of child safety and defence law for the sake of the image created by these aparmaments .
Moreover , this money does not come directly to the artists .
As far as civil aviation is concerned , Member States must facilitate the development and use of EGNOS landing procedures .
Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities carried out in the field of public administration in the maritime sector ( recast ) Joint rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast version ) - Overseas State control by the State of Osseas ( Community maritime transport monitoring and information system ) - Annual Requirements in the maritime transport sector - Securities and non-maritime transport sector - Securities scheme - Securities of maritime transport .
I voted in favour of the report on the creation of a new microfinance instrument , which will help citizens whose jobs are at risk of creating or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that we have made some progress in this area , thanks to the Vlasák report , which I do support , and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework for the urban dimension , and also to introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes , which are capable of ensuring new quality for cohesion policy .
During the trialogue , it became clear to me that the improvements that I proposed on behalf of Parliament are important in establishing fair and efficient energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is extremely important to support and encourage self-employment .
In short , they should not be asked to Brussels .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , it is clear to us and Europe , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us in Europe that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , an element of change that may cause conflict or unite us , and this is what is a subject that concerns us right now .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report , because the food programme , which is being discussed for which the extension , is a key instrument of aid for the most deprived , which is suffering extreme difficulties in the current economic crisis , even to meet the basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including EU Member States , have at least one country &apos;s favoured export credit agency ( ECAs ) , which , globally in general , represents the largest source of public financing for private sector projects .
We are therefore not voting for this report .
By adopting this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
With the creation of Conseil Franco Muslim in 2003 , Mr Sarkozy , the then Home Minister , introduced Islam in the French authorities .
On this point , I have already requested the opinion of the European Commission and asked it to consider the possibility of creating specific programmes to provide women with equal opportunities in science .
This is a battle that we will continue to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unrestricted access to services for end users .
The big European politicians and thinkers were well aware that strength that could unite Europe would be a common approach to economic problems .
The border between freedom and security is not over the edge of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , starting with this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating this strategy in key areas such as civil education , professional orientation and employment .
The cost will come from the country of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of what we can do to create a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to initiate dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the region .
We therefore predict that the accident of the reactor will occur once again in 25 years .
In my opinion , once this increased possibility of ERDF cofinancing to cover housing expenditure , we should consider other possible medium- and long-term changes , whether in terms of access to funding or in allocating funds to certain strategic priorities .
It is time today to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both these countries , which is targeted at Christians this time .
Climate change : one of the most dangerous threats to our planet .
Of course , as I expected , human rights have been given a huge meaning : it is important to guarantee that they will definitely form part of all the dynamic relations that we have and which are linked to our work .
I must also point out that the regulation of air traffic so far has not been a matter for the European Union at all .
However , Europe is not in favour of saving spanning or miraculous medicines from the economic crisis .
Therefore , I can already assure the rapporteur that the Commission is already working on a commitment to the implementation of comitology and other premises of choice .
I do not think that any of the Commission &apos;s sensitivities here today can correct the fact that the European Union is not represented in Libya and that , at the moment , it is not even able to halt the crisis in cities or the activity of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s land forces .
I therefore firmly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , the citizens of the EU will benefit from this because they will have greater opportunities to choose .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I also hope that the European Council will agree on measures to restore confidence on the markets and restore stability in the euro area , because whether we are its Member States or not , we should all have an interest in this .
Pre-accession aid has proved to be particularly accessible .
This must be warmly thankful and happy .
We therefore call on all parties to end the war and violence and urge the EU to take appropriate action .
The world &apos;s countries outside Europe recognise and address the energy problem safely .
The energy performance indicators for buildings must be included in media proclaiming for busters or bust buildings .
It is important to promote efforts aimed at boosting the EU &apos;s investments in the diversification of cross-border structures , stimulating alternative , non-conventional forms of energy at local level and improving the infrastructure &apos;s ability to encourage connectivity with new energy sources .
Good developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which thus promotes internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we must consider establishing a rapid response instrument within the framework of the ENP so that we can respond in a timely and flexible manner to political change in partner countries , such as was the case recently in the southern neighbourhood .
I simply consider it grotesque that someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission .
Thus , there is the problem that the only Members listening to you are those who can do this in the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted the concerns of our fellow citizens , namely the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the retention of jobs and the fight against crime , because in order to do a good job , we must be in line with those who voted for us .
The EU budget cannot , contrary to what some MEPs are trying to prove , be used as an addition to national budgets in times of austerity ; rather , it must reflect the difficult situation in which EU Member States are currently in .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty has not given the Council any authority to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States .
This is not a day-to-day situation .
You can give me a cík , but students do not always come to study and tourists are not always on the land for a limited period of time .
Is this the cause of the global financial crisis that is transforming into an economic crisis , or are we now facing our mistakes , negligence and lack of action ?
My second &apos; but &apos; is related to the fulfilment of the Belgian Presidency &apos;s duties in the post-Lisbon period .
The main task of these regimes was , and is to hold , the territory of this huge country , where there are many completely different nations .
( PL ) Although many economists and politicians have declared the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with the negative consequences of it .
This is what applies to many areas of Japan , but I recognise the right of Japan , for example , to defend its tool market , to protect its rice growers , to pay their farmers higher prices than to the world markets and to say &apos; no &apos; to mass imports , which would bring farmers to duration , just as I recognise the right of our economy to protect certain sectors .
( ES ) Mr President , I will speak about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
Therefore , as I have informed you when we discussed the next political guidelines for the term in office more broadly , I am determined to implement this new strategy to implement the social priorities more actively .
Therefore , Commissioner , I am going to speak out without being asked what measures - and here I am using a number of forms of numbers - the Commission is going to do in the near future to close these loopholes .
This is exactly the sort of assessment that has so far been lacking or has not been sufficiently visible to our citizens .
This is not in the interest of citizens and , quite rightly so , of all citizens .
- ( The sitting was closed at 12.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal by approving the report by Mrs Muscardini by a large majority , and I thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania has supported the open-door policy , in particular , intended to strengthen NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that everything remains to be done to deal with the consequences of this disaster and to restore normal living conditions .
I am not only talking about accidents in work , which is happening relatively often , but also about hazardous substances used over the course of their work .
In September 2009 , the Council began a detailed examination of the proposal , according to which the decision to set up the European Refugee Fund is amended .
It is now important to pay particular attention to this island and to the outermost regions , which , in addition to their permanent restrictions , have now also destroyed infrastructure and personnel , commercial and agricultural assets , and in many cases failed to resume normal activity immediately , particularly in regions that are almost totally dependent on tourism , as the pictures of events in the media could prevent the potential of wheat .
Since 9 / 11 , we have not seen such permanent industrial disruption with such huge financial losses , and despite the financial difficulties that all Member States are currently facing , I would urge them to support plans to help a sector that is simply no longer able to survive further damage .
At the same time , we must acknowledge that our excessive risk is also rising .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small language and perhaps semantic remark .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you can very much want something to happen - but you have to see the reality .
Consumer organisations prefer binding measures relating to the collective redress system in all Member States , combined with other options , such as extending the existing alternative dispute settlement mechanisms ( PNR ) to collective requirements .
The problem is not with the Turkish Cypriots , as some people tend to say .
I ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their home countries , without forcing them to endure long and to suffer full travel to consumer countries .
That is what we need to do .
I would really like to know , ladies and gentlemen , where there are human rights defenders who , like us , are pleased that the West is secular and pluralistic , who are shamefully distracted from the perspective of the Middle East , who are gradually being reserved for only one religion .
That is what we have done and we are maintaining a dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who manage our money are despicable , but Mr Schulz and the politicians who are currently promoting deficits and debt at the expense of the younger generations are just as irresponsible .
Thank you for this to the French and Czech Presidencies , to the Commission and to the rapporteurs of the individual groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to deal with this issue .
Mr President , the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for democracy and human rights was good ; in fact , the relationship was very cooperative .
We must strive to ensure that the programmes proposed give as much support as possible to the reforms implemented in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also important for each Member State to maintain national contact points in order to provide patients with all the necessary information , i.e. on access to healthcare , procedures and on the required documentation .
In the past , we have witnessed all events in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , whereas we are now discussing total free trade .
Whether it is regarded as a private or public fund , this report deals with a very specific issue , namely that Parliament stipulates that it does not have the legal right , firstly , to subsidise the budget deficit , and that , secondly , such deficit subsidies will not happen .
Of course , the reputation of the Eurocrats is expensive , as is the trap of a thousand boats in Troas Heltholic .
Aid causing distortion of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences for employment and technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a few things that I think we should bear in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard several Members saying that we want to see a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with the reverse voting mechanism .
( FR ) After all that , I think it is very important to remind ourselves what we are actually talking about here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To express my solidarity with the campaign for ending this barbaric ritual ritual slaughter , I call on you all to take a rock &apos;s bed today to symbolise your opposition to this .
Democratic controls are sidelined , insofar as national governments &apos; key actions hide behind the Commission and the &apos; noise &apos; , while the Commission is referring to national governments on these matters .
A new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After the Commission &apos;s threat of prosecuting the Court of Justice of the European Union , it is now permitted to use deco-BDE in Sweden .
It is clear to those here who come from rural areas , just like those in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that this situation , which has many livestock farmers , must no longer continue .
Sectors deserve transparent , easy understandable and accessible information .
I believe that our task is to help the Chinese people build a harmonious society .
I voted in favour of these two mechanisms because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus ensure our future .
It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - a public organisation or a non-governmental organisation - clearly defines the subject and the objectives of the initiative , although it is not mandatory for this organiser to submit a legislative proposal .
There is a town in Latvia where over 90 % of the Russian-speaking population live .
Here , I would like to welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apology , as well as the Czech Government &apos;s recent proposal requiring the Ministry of Health to take a number of measures to ensure that such violations do not happen again from 31 December 2009 .
I welcome this report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
The effects of globalisation have now been fully taken over the financial and economic crisis , and our real response is to adapt the EGF &apos;s financing criteria .
This resolution recognises the independence declaration adopted on 17 February 2008 by Kosovo , which has been recognised by 69 countries , calling on Member States to cooperate in order to develop a common approach to Kosovo , bearing in mind the planned accession to the European Union of Kosovo .
Compared to the two other two institutions , it can still be assumed that Parliament is taking a leading role in transparency , so I do not consider this to be my prime task , because we are more open about document availability and the transparency of MEPs &apos; activities than any national parliament .
It is the cause of the internal policy of the Italian Minister for Reform , Umberto Bossi .
The acts of human rights observation institute in Asturias , which is my region and several other organisations , deserve to be taken seriously .
I voted in favour of the Casini report .
in writing . - ( FR ) I very much regret the adoption of this resolution , which concerns banning pig and cattle thrombin .
I have therefore decided to abstain from the vote and will keep a close eye on the ongoing investigation .
Neither is the European Commission &apos;s data sufficiently precise to identify measures for disciplining Member States with the highest levels of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement about the fifth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
What is even more important is that improving the energy performance of buildings is the best way to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors without an emissions trading system .
Turning to the second question , I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware of the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the control of the AMR .
The trialogue held yesterday gives great hope for the final agreement .
The forecasts for the future , based on an annual increase of around 27 % over the coming years , indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis for this proposal should be adapted in such a way as to reform the text in the form of a regulation and not in the form of a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because this EU financial assistance will allow people affected by globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and help them avoid falling back the yields .
Given that , in cultural terms , the Internet is a key instrument for creating better conditions , and for developing development and knowledge in the interests of citizens , particularly through audiovisual content broadcasting , I support the adoption of this report and I hope that the European Union will play a leading role in creating radio spectrum and innovation and software .
And all this is accompanied by the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and about the problems that the accession of this country , of which there are more than 80 million citizens , is the factors that will continue to strengthen my unshakeable belief that it is not right for Turkey to enter Europe , whose unity is mostly based on the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests )
This means harmful to the environment and to consumer safety , because old , high energy consumption and potentially hazardous equipment will come back onto the market .
Thank you for your attention , and I look forward to the debate .
I would like to put on the record my thanks to the mayor of Basel Reitemann and the local council for allowing this monument to honour the lives of these young people .
Thirdly , I have a strong request to Mrs Kroes : to speed up the process of digitisation in the Member States so that we can be proud of this ambitious flagship project in the future .
Anyone who experienced and saw the consequences of the environmental disaster caused the technological failures in Baia Mare and the consequent leakage of toxic cyanide in waters with far-reaching consequences for the Fasas fason in Hungary and the Danube in Bulgaria will do everything possible to ensure that nothing like this occurs in the European Union .
It is all responsibility - it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and to their property : freedom of movement , as you said when crossing border lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs because it proposes rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we find the courage to convene this summit , that we invited the social partners to participate in the longer term - before the employment meeting is held in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we try to draw conclusions that will be valuable to the June Council .
In other words , the European Parliament , at first reading , created a good basis for the correct application of cross-border healthcare provision in the Member States , by making the rules justifiable in cases and in accordance with the established rules , and without encumbering the patients of the courts to the desired non-hospital and hospital care they need in another Member State .
This was also proposed in the Barnier report , but we have not reached a conclusion so far .
We cannot waste any time .
Another absurd reality amendment is once again faced by a tiny attempt by the European Parliament to influence the situation in Venezuela .
