I called on the Council Presidency to write a similar statement to our resolution on this occasion , and also on the mass murder of Tiananananmen in the square in June .

Firstly , among the parties involved , I must mention the role of the President of the South Africa and of the African Union , Thabo Mbeki , who carried out the role of mediator in mediator , and I think that our own Special Representative for Sudan , Rosalind Marden , must also be emphasised .
I would like to thank the members of the social economy , who took part and made it possible for this Parliament to send a signal to the Commission so that it finally recognises the common European statute for mutual societies , associations and foundations .

However - and I think this concerns several Members - we must be extremely careful with the methods and means we use to ensure a rapid and immediate relief for this vulnerable economic sector .
It is therefore essential not to conduct a simple revision of the technical agreements and to deal with two of the key defects of the euro area that have been revealed by the crisis .
We are therefore offering a regulation and guidelines that will expand the range of options and opportunities for small businesses throughout the entire chain , from the reserve share to vehicle repair .

However , the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness disruptions is particularly guaranteed by EU Member States , which attracted the euro , a higher degree of economic and financial fragility in all euro area Member States ; reduced market discipline ; the volatility of exchange rates and increased adjustment problems are potentially high for the entire euro area .
For my country , and particularly for the affected populations , it is important for the European Parliament to approve this decision .
It is not enough simply to adjust the word &apos; solidarity &apos; to make this European energy policy acceptable if , moreover , the same amendment prohibits the EU from intervening in the market .
The aim of this activity is to put a stop to the practice of rail sector referring to national standards in order to prevent rolling stock , which has already been approved in other countries .
But we can already conclude now that racism and xenophobia are phenomena that are still present in the European Union and that these phenomena affect the lives of the representatives of ethnic minorities .

Despite many advances in medicine , the spread of cancer worldwide today is very similar to the epidemic .
According to recent reports , at least 76 German MEPs are members of this fund .

A suitable framework must be created for our contractual relations , because the current Trade and Cooperation Agreement is so restrictive that it is not possible to do so .
On the other hand , however , I can see that , at the same time , the glass is half empty , because , as far as the common agricultural policy is concerned , the document refers very many times to the public good and the services that agriculture needs to provide to the population , while little is focused on the primary production of agricultural products and the competitiveness of the sector .
Although I very much want to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and with all those affected by this accident , and also my support for the local authorities , I would like to use this forum to appeal to the European Community , because it has to be said that this situation requires a European response and , above all , requires European solidarity .

In order to promote stability between the eastern neighbours and minimise the impact on the Member States , the EU must adopt a strong policy towards Russia , which must be developed in close cooperation with the Atlantic partners , and which must include the relevant multilateral organisation , including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .
We can do so in a way that we can be successful , so I call on everyone - Parliament , the Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank - to break their heads together and find a successful way forward .
Moreover , the Council of Ministers has not yet been involved , meaning that we do not even have all of the main legislative units .

( LT ) Madam President , the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is a very important issue , both for environmental and human safety and for public safety .
Canada &apos;s negotiator even acknowledged at the beginning of the year that this agreement is a top priority for Canada .
We have gradually implemented this in the European Union , and so energy security has become one of the Union &apos;s strategic priorities .
The system is probably preventing a flexible economy and making autonomous decisions so that countries can effectively address their problems , for example in the context of inflation indicators .

It seems , however , that the first to be the shortage of food that we will face , as it is already a billion people in the world who are suffering from hunger .
Unfortunately , however , its aim seems to have been to attack and destroy our small and medium-sized enterprises .
In my opinion , the issue of geographical balance , which is so often emphasised , could have been achieved a much better solution .

Whatever happens , this outbreak of the conflict has already had a negative impact on a large proportion of the civilian population in the region and on the United Nations representation in Gaza .

I expect the same interest from the US authorities in the matter of equal treatment of Member States in relation to the visa waiver programme .
If Mrs Roure wants to go to Lampedusa tomorrow morning , she will not find any lively sons there and if she will read the Italian newspapers , she will find that it was Mr Maroni , who denounced the trafficking of organs : children disappeared from Lampedusa when there was a left-wing government in his country .
I do not deny that nuclear energy can form part of a balanced &apos; modified &apos; of European energy , and its use may reduce our dependence on external sources in this area , but I believe that the European Union cannot shirk from commitments to closing down ageing nuclear facilities while also ensuring that economic recovery projects deserve adequate funding .
The decisions made at the NATO Summit , as well as the declarations made by the President of the United States , for example , show that NATO is not opposed to the common security and defence policy , but rather seeks to find a path of cooperation that benefits both institutions .
Mr Schmidt proposed amendments on the voluntary participation of Member States in sanctions regimes that are not part of the euro area .
Mr Leinen &apos;s report deals with the impact of the Treaty on Parliament and sets out very detailed aspects of Parliament &apos;s work in the light of the new policies , new powers and new procedures .
I do not want to make accusations , but experience shows that next time everything needs to be done better .

That would be a pity .
MEPs have said &apos; no &apos; to the flexible response and &apos; no &apos; to the unacceptable pressure that France is putting on the main democratic institution of the European continent !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the international community , we are undoubtedly running a great risk of our credibility with regard to the events in Afghanistan .
However , our arguments must be justified so that citizens do not think that the European Union is only concerned about itself , but can see that it is also concerned about the interests of the citizens .
This explains why we hear a vicious call from Members calling on Member States to accept innocent prisoners who cannot return to their countries because they fear torture .
In view of the usual practice with European Union law , in due course , the Commission was asked to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions as to whether these laws need to be amended .
Of course , banning political parties is usually a bad idea , even though there are exceptions to this law .
It is true that in the last ten years , tourism has changed radically , not least through technological progress .
If Turkey makes a clear effort to establish good relations with its neighbouring countries by resolving outstanding problems peacefully and respecting the Charter of the UN and other European documents , then there is hope .

You represent a country whose citizens confronted the troops of the Warsaw Pact .
According to the directive , fund managers must be registered and obtained permission and comply with the European Union &apos;s strong code of conduct .
Three years ago , the report on visa facilitation with Russia was adopted , which accepted my amendment that the mandatory registration procedure is a serious obstacle to travel in Russia and the EU .
These people are simply dreaming of a better life , and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy .
It is clear that the inhabitants of areas affected remain very often returned to transport communications at national level and that the opportunities for civil aviation are limited .
This indicates that this policy must always be pursued in accordance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I will conclude by saying that we will hold this conference , and I hope that , of course , under your time , you can consider my invitation to visit part of this meeting , Baroness Ashton .

Under the Copenhagen political criteria , Turkey is expected to ensure cultural diversity and promote cultural rights for all its citizens , as stipulated in our accession partnership .
Thus , by committing itself to finding this fund funds in the 2011 budget , despite the particularly decreased reserves , Parliament has once again fulfilled its obligations towards European citizens .
This is why Parliament &apos;s question was so strongly supported in committee , which I very much welcome .
Finally , I would like to say that the fact that the rapporteur from one of the smaller groups took on such a complex dossier and worked actively with the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups is an important democratic signal and something that this institution should be proud of .
I believe that it is important to support the full liberalisation of the free movement of European SMEs , as well as people , goods and services , in order to maximise the benefits of the single market .
There are other concerns , however .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Mrs Swinburne &apos;s report is a key turning point in the process of regulatory reform .
Ladies and gentlemen , part of what is being called for here is quite simply absurd and I will therefore vote against this report .
However , now in Copenhagen , we must ensure that the positive outcome achieved over the last year is retained at Copenhagen .
As far as disarmament or anti-missile shield is concerned , the European Union must ensure that its position is clear to Russia and the US .
It goes without saying that the cohesion instruments and , above all , the funds , must be a genuine European added value for our fellow citizens , but today , in the light of the severe crisis facing Europe , they must be better able to respond and be more adapted to urban situations , in particular .
Since , as regards the first problem , we have the resources for development and cooperation programmes supported by the EU , which are obviously not yet enough , the second issue must now be addressed in different ways at national level .
A catalogue must be established on the whole system of private quality certification and the basic legal framework must be adopted at EU level to ensure that these systems operate transparently .

The Green New Deal , in other words the logic of a new economic organisation based on innovation in environmental technology , supported by the international capital markets , will become a cornerstone of an increasingly numerous economic rescue and stimulation programmes , including among the Member States of the European Union .
The bilateral agreements in some Member States , based on various projects such as Nord Stream , do not create trust in terms of environmental safety and respect for the principle of solidarity , and that is why transparency is required .
I think this is good and important .
We all understand that we will have to make a significant difference in the direction of the current policy , and this is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , now it is important that the Commission and the Member States have a solid foundation for reaching a good agreement in Copenhagen .
My second comment concerns the use of a multilateral perspective - an idea that is so often defended in this House .
Many colleagues in Parliament have already demonstrated their interest in the political groups , but it is our duty to put a much greater political power on this issue .
I think that our prime task is to complete the whole process , consolidate the Single Market , with as transparent as possible - in close cooperation with the European Parliament .
I think it is best described by the Dutch proverb : the same waste must be used for the sake of a single orcheal monk .
I therefore call on the European Ombudsman to encourage the ombudsmen of the Member States to regularly exchange views with the relevant national parliaments , just as we in the European Parliament share views with the European Ombudsman .
Firstly , it is job creation and retention , not so much emphasis on questions of social assistance , but above all on investments in infrastructure , on restoring entrepreneurship , on creating these jobs .
Madam President , Mrs Figueiredo has been very precise , and I have only one comment to make .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the abolition of the previous pillar structure , all conditions for the US visa waiver programme are now an EU responsibility .
We therefore welcome the Commission &apos;s initiative , and with the consent of my colleague , Mrs Lochbihler , the rapporteur , we fully support this .
We have serious problems with competition between the two courts - the Strasbourg Court and the Court of Justice .
This includes the harmonisation of measuring , socio-economic labelling and , above all , the greatest concern , the identification mark for radio frequencies , which would increase the costs for entrepreneurs and the consumer .
( SV ) Mr President , Europe &apos;s greatest failure at the moment is that we have not yet managed to stop the trafficking of human beings before our very eyes .
That is why , as can be seen , economic and social changes are occurring in European action and in European culture .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , because it is important to start working on this issue .
Since this is a disease whose costs are very high , which the majority of patients are unable to cover , it is desirable to increase funding for the purchase of medicines .
I would like to express my deepest sympathy and our solidarity with the victims and their families once again on behalf of all here .
If this process is resumed , I sincerely hope that the perpetrators will be found and arrested , because otherwise , there is a risk of more blood being perceived and perceived as authorised to do so .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
We must address regional and local authorities , as well as other stakeholders , and encourage them to use this second opportunity .
The EU must adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effectively active at an early stage in the prevention and detection of fraud , so that public funds can only be made available if they are genuinely used correctly , while maintaining effective penalties for those who violate the law , attempting to make such funds illegal , which are , by nature , insufficient .
I cannot , therefore , share Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s view that the whole package is based on only one point , namely reversed qualified majority voting .
The challenges were really big : the transition from the Treaty of Nice &apos;s legal system to the system envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon was also set up the next multiannual programme , which stipulates that the area of freedom , security and justice should be given priority over the next five years .
In my opinion , the currency is , in fact , stable , and it is also stable from an historic point of view .
This is at the heart of everything we will do in this country to make sure that action is taken in accordance with the rule of law , and this , of course , applies to the legal system , but also to the political and constitutional reform that is so essential .
In this context , the operational needs and the problems of harmonising European Parliament and European Union expenditure need to be addressed .
We know that .
These procedures do not include the proper assessment of products before they are displaced on the market and do not mention the danger of trade in GMOs , which has been condemned repeatedly .
You rightly said that we must first make sure that the farm is not remote , and that is the crucial point that I would like to discuss .
The question of whether drug addiction would be criminal is in the hands of the laws of the Member States , and the EU should not try to distort legal action .
They expect that .
Now the Member States need to take appropriate measures that could help to prevent hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths in poorer households throughout Europe .
We will then stop before we finally vote .
Economic and regional integration will not happen unless the Union has the courage to resolve the existing conflicts and to do so on the basis of international law .
Now we want to see a truly rapid implementation of the law and we call on the Commission to give money to support this process .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s statement that the transposition , implementation and enforcement of the directives relating to unfair business-to-consumer practices in the internal market , as well as the directive on misleading and comparative advertising , are essential for achieving the objectives set out in the directives , particularly by taking into account the different methods of application and enforcement of the various legal concepts , the complexity of certain directives , as regards unfair commercial practices and the general application of public enforcement directives , as well as extensive advertising and the various areas of public law .
The European Union must intervene when adopting legislation to ensure gender equality in the labour market and reduce gender segregation .
The fact is that consumers are entitled to certain basic information , such as &apos; what I purchase ? &apos; , &apos; What material is it made of ? &apos; and where is it coming from ?
( PL ) Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s discussion , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Article 47 of the Commission Regulation of 2006 .
I would also like to remind you of the Global Trade Organisation &apos;s Global Trade Organisation Pact , which offers a suitable set of strategic options for getting us out of this crisis .
Given the serious consequences of the Catholic Welsh on livestock farms , all measures promoting good practice in the area of vaccination should be adopted to protect farmers from the loss of animals , which could cause such damage , often prove to be the fate of such farms .
Closure of the sitting
Mr President , one of the changes that the Prime Minister spoke about this morning is the citizens &apos; initiative .
President-in-Office of the Council . - In December 2008 , an agreement was reached at the Pozna≈Ñ Conference on the Work Programme for 2009 , which clearly identified the steps to be taken until Copenhagen climate conference in December 2009 .
The final draft agenda for this plenary sitting , compiled by the President meeting of Thursday , 5 February pursuant to Rules 170 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure , has been distributed .

The European Commission agrees with honourable Members that the ever-increasing number of migrant children poses serious problems in education in most Member States .
When the day comes , where Members will have to propose legislation , every lobby will find his or her Member to serve his interests .

That is precisely what the second part of the European Economic Recovery Programme is intended for this , and logically that is also in line with the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Today , Parliament voted to reject the authorisation to use thrombin as a food additive .
What has happened to solidarity ?
Parliament helped to make the directive more ambitious than the Council &apos;s common position on certain important points .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
According to the legal procedure , the Council will adopt this text after the final legal review of the linguistic language , and after that directive can be published in the shortest possible time in the Official Journal of the European Union .
The Chancellor scanners are not wrong , but they are the best available technology , so we need to use the tools at our disposal to reduce the threat of terrorism .
We are not helping them if we say that they can escape this path ; that does not help them .
The crucial aspect of this initiative is the fundamental value : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my country , Estonia , this fund is not being used , and when I asked why it was said that the rules were too stringent and that the limit , which until now was 1 000 people , makes this impossible .
I trust that together , we will succeed in establishing the basic principles that should guide and promote future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very worrying to see that the number of attacks on Christians and their communities is increasing .
The proposals are also made to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact , and to look in particular at the debt situation in particular in order to improve the economic governance of the Euro Group in the euro area and to create a robust and effective mechanism for preventing and regulating credit default in the euro area , which could include the creation of a European Monetary Fund .
The next problem is the service fee demanded by external service providers .
We do not want a &apos; shelter &apos; to exist and a new Delaware to be created in the European Union , where companies can violate such laws .
Firstly , the EU budget for 2011 lays down priorities that need to be strengthened in the context of Europe &apos;s economic problems caused by the structural crisis of recent years .
We need to be able to protect farmers &apos; incomes , and we need to introduce market mechanisms to prevent price fluctuations like the one we are currently experiencing .
We need better employment indicators , we need a better gender balance , and we need higher levels of education .
This proposal complements the existing European Community legal framework under which the prohibition of discrimination against the grounds of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation applies solely to employment , profession and vocational training .
( The President cut off the speaker and displayed him )
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has caused a huge disaster , and the radioactive contamination has also affected many people who were close to and injured by the plant .
In order to be able to propose new and more considered measures , we need to assess and fully understand what is at our disposal what the consequences are , what the consequences are and where there are overlaps .

However , we have also talked about a holistic approach in the past .
The 13th session of human rights is the most important part-session in 2010 , and it will hold high-level meetings and discussions with the government ministers on a number of important issues that the Commissioner and the Minister have already mentioned , such as the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation in the world .
I also think that the number of errors or failures is relatively small , but nonetheless , there is too much .

As we close my mandate , I would like to thank all my colleagues from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , who gave me their support to this report .
I do not want to shy away from the answer and I do not simply want to say that I will not answer , but you are all well aware that if you ask a question in Parliament , I will probably not want to use my position as President-in-Office of the Council to answer the question of the internal situation of a Member State of the European Union .
Texts of agreements forwarded by the Council : see Minutes

We say that we are facing a &apos; wall of silence &apos; .
in writing . - The mid-term review of the financial framework 2007-2013 is unrealistic and unrealistic because of the lack of clarity about the Lisbon Treaty ratification process , the end of the current parliamentary term , the results of the European Parliament elections and the creation of the new Commission in the current economic context .
As this debate has clearly shown , this semester is a long list of tasks to be carried out .
In the plenary statement of January 2010 , Spain underlined a firm commitment to combating domestic violence against women , proposing a legislative proposal to prevent violence against women and setting up a European observatory for preventing domestic violence .

I am sure that this system will develop over time , but I am very much in favour of Mr H√∂kmark &apos;s report because it reinforces the provisions contained in the proposal , maintaining the necessary balance .
We in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) support cooperation in the area of legal immigration if we make it clear that at the same time , we are exacerbating the fight against illegal immigration .
Parliament and the Union must therefore also consider showing solidarity - if possible officially - with our country and with all the countries involved in this attack .

In the case of political incidents that may affect the other party , we are discussing the matter in time on both sides .
However , the right thing to do would be if the blame were sought in the face , in the European leaders .
I am therefore convinced of the importance of this agreement and confirm my vote in favour of the agreement reached .
Thirdly , the internal market is a crucial factor in security of supply .
That is why we fully agree with the rapporteur , who , in paragraph 40 of his report , calls on Turkey to &apos; promote an appropriate climate negotiation , citing Turkey &apos;s armed force and enabling both leaders to speak freely about the future of their country &apos; .
In some Member States , patients lack easy access to basic information about the medicines they are prescribed .
Mr President , as Mr Papanikolaou said , the objective of the Cultural Programme is to enrich the cultural experience of European citizens using our common cultural heritage .

There is often a cross-border impact in the nuclear industry .
It is true that we are going through a crisis at the moment , and the Court that is maintaining voluntary investments from a number of countries is absorbing large sums of money .
It is bizarre that it is almost impossible to involve the parliaments of the partner countries in fulfilling these agreements .
Another important point that concerns us is passengers .

The rapporteur , Mr S√∏ndergaard , will join us in following the delay in flights , so I will ask him to speak later .
The Mediterranean diet still includes fibre breadcrumbs , many fruit and vegetables - so we welcome the Commission &apos;s programme on the supply of fruit to schools , fish , dairy products in an modest quantity and also wine .
Thus , there is a general desire in Parliament to re-examine certain points in this directive , and unfortunately , over the last few days , the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur have not met to discuss these 60 amendments .

Another reason why I voted in favour of strengthening the OSCE is the human rights dimension , which includes the protection of minority rights and fundamental freedoms , which are key elements of the OSCE &apos;s integrated security concept .

I welcome the Commission &apos;s support for extending the transitional period so that once we have the new legislation , all countries have the same legal framework .
The EU is not democratic and it therefore does not adequately protect people &apos;s rights .
I would also like to emphasise the essential feature of the fund , which is to provide assistance to people , not to businesses , and therefore from this point of view , we cannot regard this as a mechanism for supporting companies that do not have any prospect of a realistic existence economically , but rather as opposed to it .

In Poland , in my country , which I represent , around 250 000 people suffer from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , and specialists estimate that by 2040 this figure will have trebled .
Given that we have 27 countries with 27 different healthcare systems , the Commission proposal , based solely on Article 95 - the famous harmonisation article - will lead to the demolition of national health care systems , thereby depriving Member States of their responsibilities .
We believe that this will be unrealistic , costly and ineffective , especially in schools where children come from a different language environment , and it will not contribute to the integration of migrants into the local community .
I would also like to emphasise the recognition of traditional agriculture , in particular , the recognition of organic and small-scale farms , which are not only in the less developed regions , but , above all , in terms of economic value , because it is essential to preserve biodiversity .
Unless the specifications and distribution of emissions compensation are proportionate , it will be impossible to avoid distortion of competition .
Fortunately , this fight is mainly happening in the economic sector , not with weapons .

The European Union &apos;s presence in Kosovo is gradually being carried out from the United Nations .
The motion for a resolution contains details that we cannot agree with , particularly &apos; promoting a global carbon trading trade &apos; , given that this solution has already shown that it does not provide an advantage in reducing carbon emissions , as well as in establishing more public-private partnerships , by emphasising &apos; a substantial increase in public financing &apos; , thereby making public money available to provide the private interests and profits .
However , when concluding an agreement with a country as large as Congo , various serious problems arise .
As far as I know , there is only one race - someone .
President Mubarak , as he is now - and I respect his long-standing struggle - is unable to lead the political transition ; it is madness to ask him to allow Mubarak &apos;s cklanam to conclude invoices with Elak Barklanon the streets today .
The social situation has developed very favourably , the average income per capita has risen significantly , and the majority of Tunisians now comply with the middle class criteria .
I would like to make a couple of comments on the reports .

Voting time
( DE ) Mr President , the old saying &apos; I like betray , but a true deputy &apos; has proved to be true once again .
It is certainly possible to help the poorest regions in the EU and , at the same time , to use good projects to combat climate change , reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy and modern technology solutions .
All of these components constitute a single common strategy that , in my opinion , enables us to find coordinated solutions .
I would also like to recommend that the EU also decides to join these numerous useful additional protocols concerning issues such as combating torture , fighting racism or improving the effectiveness of legislation .
Well , that is what I am saying .
It is the task of the Member States , with the support of the European Commission , to protect and develop our forests so that we can bring them to future generations and , in turn , contribute to the natural habitats , our society and our economies .

Furthermore , the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy will have to adapt new economic and social conditions at local and regional level , taking into account the increase in energy costs .
I am grateful that I had the opportunity to take responsibility and , as a citizen , I remain responsible for Brandenburg , who is my home , for a single Germany , my beloved father , and a Europe on which unity will depend our destiny and future .
The ECR Group welcomes this debate .
The examples given by fellow Members speak for themselves and we see Turkey on a very long road before it fulfils the standards of the European Union .

This disease that was transmitted was first opened on the day he was preparing to take two weeks &apos; leave in June last year and has lost 64 of his 82 cow herds since then .

rapporteur . - ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are finalising the work we started 10 years ago ; I still remember now the indignation that was caused by the accident with the Erika in December 1999 : the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio made proposals at the time , the cooperation of the Council , which , under pressure from public opinion , was , at least partly responsible for monitoring the first and second European legislation with regard to the preparation of my ships .
I would like to thank all those who participated in this .
Mr President , first of all , please accept Mr ≈†efƒçoviƒç and Mr Oettinger &apos;s apologies for these issues , but this time I have been asked to represent them .

Mr President , you yourself have seen this , but it is continuing , and that is the case that Israel collectively punishes innocent people in Gaza .
I cannot ignore the fact that rail transport has ERTMS , SESAR and GALILEO programmes , but I do not believe that we are lacking in user information for users ; access to limited mobility ; and adapting urban vehicles to their needs today ; and to the safety of urban vehicles ; and , in particular , to public transport , which is a very important issue of transport ;
This is a reality that there is no doubt about .
But this is a political institution and we are all doing a serious political job as well as we can .
Mr President , for the sake of the welfare of these horses , all the measures we have taken here in this House in the area of animal rights must not be overlooked .
Our predecessors have demonstrated on numerous occasions that our peoples can be united in times when our destiny is determined .

( CS ) Mr President , I distance myself from the amendments that have just been tabled to the Z√°borsk√° report on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity .
This applies , in particular , to legislators .
Instead of saying &apos; one year after the earthquake &apos; , we should actually say &apos; year of earthquakes &apos; , because there was a seismic earthquake , then the earthquake with regard to providing chaotic aid later - an earthquake which is , in a sense , a cholera - a political earthquake with the untransparent elections , which has been going on in the worst possible time , and now the earthquake that has , in a way , been returning to a great extent , historic .
This means that , if these same guidelines , policies and pressures continue to be implemented in Portugal and in other countries with weaker economies , the differences are beginning to increase dramatically and the lack of solidarity of the European Union will become increasingly serious as a result of our situation .
The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy , including with regard to the external dimension , as well as integrated maritime surveillance in the various sectors and regions , so as to raise awareness of the situation of maritime activity in the sea , which also affects safety and safety of shipping , among other things , as regards compliance with general legislation .
Romania supports the significant progress made in the negotiations with Turkey , a process that is dynamic enough to promote international reforms .

I support Mrs Matias &apos;s report because Europe needs to ensure close cooperation and coordination between Member States capable of ensuring effective prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease , and the disease that today affects 6 million Europeans .
Similarly , when we promote clean technologies , the traditional technology of the indigenous peoples will be saved in a multi-ethnic context so that they can then sell them at great cost to the very same citizens who invented them .
I call on the French overseas department to initiate this change as management bodies for the Structural Funds so that their regional programmes can focus immediately on projects that show the greatest potential for growth and jobs .

We would like to put a third stop to the times when stability was used as a harsh element and when it was used to obtain relief in the area of respect for human rights and democracy .
Mr President , Mr Parish rightly reminded us of something that we have mentioned many times in this Chamber , namely , that the way we treat animals shows us how &apos; culturally &apos; and civilised we are .
In my opinion , the Doha Round is very important in the context of international trade and can help greatly to reduce poverty in developing countries and to distribute the benefits of globalisation more fairly .
Unfortunately , that is what is most often falsified and often there are no active substances - just the sugar and the box .
Greece will , of course , continue to use cohesion funds , as it is one of the countries that benefits from these funds , and this aspect is not related to the European Union 2020 strategy .
The mother of Privory made a allegation against √Ågnes Hankiss that she had probably slandered publicly and , in particular , the memory of the dead person - the petitioner .
There is also Ambassador Poul Skytte Christoffersen , who also participated in the negotiations .
The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems to me to be completely balanced , and I welcome the work that Mr Tarabella has done to achieve this result .
The future of this complex measure is absolutely clear .
Madam President , on Monday evening , the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a proposal on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka under Rule 91 of the Rules of Procedure .

I would like to ask the Commission , Commissioner , and the European Parliament to look carefully at and recognise as intolerable all practices on EU territory which can be used for ethnic or racist discrimination .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the most important question is , without doubt , what do we now ?
It is the European Parliament &apos;s duty to talk about this .
in writing . - In 2008 , when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament , I submitted draft amendments to the Criminal Code to the Republic of Latvia , which intended to increase liability for domestic violence against women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I am pleased that this facilitation will not be put into practice , because there are safe alternatives that will not only benefit consumers but also professional users in future .
Secondly , at all costs , building materials that are harmful to health , such as asbestos , must be avoided .
In other words , the reason for this debate is the need for caution and , in particular , for the conclusions that we have all drawn from reviewing the successes just mentioned in Detroit .
Finally , I would like to emphasise , in particular , how important it is to build shipping routes , and to draw attention to the proposal presented by Greece last summer for establishing a transport observation centre in the eastern part of the Mediterranean , Greece .
The European Union can probably learn lessons from the EUR 2 billion invested by the Chinese and African Development Fund in Africa .
Interpretation of the Treaty &apos;s provisions seems to depend on a belated direction .
I support this report , which will also allow Romania to use funding to facilitate the social inclusion of marginalised people , including the Roma , in both urban and rural areas .
I would like to stress that this is about international waters and that the Danish Foreign Minister , Lene Esperse , has also stressed that this is unacceptable .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I had hoped that during this part-session , Parliament would approve Jose Manuel Barroso &apos;s appointment as President of the Commission for the next five years .
Council and Commission statements on the medium-term financial assistance mechanism for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
At the same time , however , the country was left out of health care professionals , most of whom were Bulgarians .
The interests of the mothers and the main powers , both economic and financial , always replace the interests of solidarity .
The Czech Government and its President have every right to say and do what they want , but they must not forget that they are part of the European Union and are now speaking on behalf of almost 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
Such a situation leads to a significant reduction in the financial problems faced by companies , particularly SMEs , and to a significant reduction in their investment opportunities and a reduction in competitiveness .
Finally , we believe that this pre-accession instrument is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising funding for candidate countries and potential candidate countries .
In the meantime , we need to introduce sanctions such as freezing funds and banning exit .
This is a practice that we know , and our proposals are directly intended to eliminate the linkage advertising in many areas .
Once again this year , we are seeing Russia threatened to cut off the gas supply , and the signs show that , with this opportunity , we will have to look at every winter .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for being prepared for some compromises at the last minute .
Mr President , I welcome President Obama &apos;s decision this month to visit the EU-US Summit in Lisbon and have voted in favour of the resolution today .
Hundreds of thousands of people are administrative detention , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political oppression , death sentences - all these methods are incompatible with the obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a member of the United Nations .
The basis is not conclusive because this arrest is one of the hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic fight against all kinds of signs of dissent .
This is pointless .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial situation , Europe must continue to support projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector so that the economy is sustainable and socially competitive .
I think that the debate on the Single Market and the Services Directive and how this is about patients &apos; rights was very interesting .
When it comes to the Tobin tax and the financial transaction tax , you are right - that is perhaps not what Mr Tobin originally intended for .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that I am pleased to learn that Turkey is so close to the hearts and minds of my colleague , Madlener , the Dutch Party for Freedom .
As the Council &apos;s last conclusions indicate , a high level of visits must always address the issue of human rights and include , where appropriate , meetings with the peaceful democratic opposition .
However , the only thing that Kozloduy used to serve as an example was that old reactors can be safe and work very well .
With regard to the Danish Government &apos;s plans to introduce controls at the domestic borders of the country , which Mrs Koppa mentioned , you are , of course , aware that the President of the Commission immediately sent a letter to the Danish Prime Minister stating that the first analyses carried out by the Commission raised significant doubts as to whether the proposed measures are in line with the Danish obligations under European and international law .
The European Commission , as the guardian of the EU Treaty , must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and provide in time all the necessary information on planned actions in energy infrastructure .
This is a very clear signal from the European institutions that European citizens do not support the brutal treatment of animals and their killing .
Mr Morel is doing a good job as the Special Representative , but it is not enough .
I remember the hearings with the members of the Court of Auditors , who promised to work closely with Parliament .
As a result of additional costs , many private firms and , of course , national transport schemes should increase the price of ticket for purchasers and reduce the number of routes .
However , in the reports , I see both the big and the shadows .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
That is not what we want .
I call on the rapporteur to table an oral amendment to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of those who work based on Christianity .
( The sitting was closed at 23.00 )
For example , the disappearance of women to life in another country cannot be considered to be supported , particularly in cases where it is not actually determined whether it is legal or illegal immigrants .
We support these objectives , just as we supported the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
I believe that in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , it is necessary to ask whether the Arctic indigenous peoples living in the Russian Federation are sufficiently involved in the work of the Arctic Council .
In this judgment , the Court of Justice made a number of comments on how to improve the listing procedure carried out by the UN Sanctions Against al-Qaeda and the Taliban Committee .
For this , I would like to thank all my fellow Members who participated , the shadow rapporteurs , the rapporteurs and everyone else .
In a context where the economic situation of some countries , such as Greece , is weakening the euro , the desire expressed by Mr Draghi and the commitment to forcefully moving towards a strong currency are necessary to ensure confidence in our economies .
Discrimination based on religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation have no place in European society .
Firstly , we need to reach a legally binding agreement .
We have , to a certain extent , already managed to feel its spirit by adopting the regulation on hedge funds yesterday in the Ecofin Council .
Welcome
I voted for this report because money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to the workers affected by collective redundancies .
As part of this policy , the EU must be able to respond to any potential sudden supply crisis .
The aim of this support is to improve the living conditions of the people in the recipient countries by recommending and providing all the instruments necessary to ensure that they get on the path of development and responsibility .
It is therefore necessary to commit to achieving better results in the future and the next chance to implement this year in Mexico .
That is true .
The blasphemy laws , which provide for the death penalty , are incompatible with the common values that we are striving to promote our relations with Pakistan .
I supported the European Parliament resolution , which calls on Member States in particular to take appropriate measures to slow down the spread of this disease , such as promoting a healthy way of life and ensuring that all sufferers have access to treatment , create specialist centres , ensure at national level sufficient medical equipment and draw up strategic research action plans in this area .
There is no stability without solidarity .
Since January , 23 000 immigrants have arrived in Italy .
Thanks to the Maltese Order of Orthodox , the Jewish Refugees Service ( JRS ) and many Christian organisations , the government recognises its duty to resolve the refugee problems .
That is why , as has already been said , next week , the Stockholm Summit will focus on the mutual interest areas , such as climate change and energy , as well as the global economic crisis .
Vice-President of the Commission . - In a rapidly moving towards a new digital era , Europe must be equipped with excellent broadband infrastructure , which will indeed be the driving force for tomorrow &apos;s growth .
Madam President , today we voted on the review of the Green Paper on the future of TEN-T policy .
As I worked in the Scientific and Technological Equipment Working Group - a project aimed at achieving more efficient management of natural resources - I believe that it is very important to draw up a reliable statistical database .
Last but not least , I would like to mention the international trade relationship with climate change .
in writing . - This report proposes a variety of measures , some of which could help small businesses , but whose overall intention is to promote EU control , the dismay of citizens , the feminist agenda and infiltration of companies with EU officials &apos; working experience &apos; .
This exemption has been proposed in order to tackle the crisis that has arisen , and that is clear to everyone , and we have already discussed this many times .
The close link between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is obvious .
Over these 15 years , 189 countries , which signed the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality , have made some progress in all 12 areas set out in this document .
2009 enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All participants should seize bona fide opportunities offered by the Geneva talks .
I understand that the total amount of illegal cigarette trafficked in the European Union amounts to EUR 9.5 billion and of which 97 % are not paid for .
I also welcome the reference to the project bonds initiative , which is , in my opinion , a useful tool for promoting growth and development in a strategic sector as important as infrastructure .
Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the requirements , and I congratulate Mr Coelho on unifying freedom of movement and citizens &apos; security in his balanced report , which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are deciding what needs to be done in this regard , but let us remember that , in terms of financial aid , it is primarily necessary to overcome the crisis .
However , do you really feel that small businesses and their employees believe that the European Union is doing so ?
They came to Brussels to tell this Parliament that if we adopt the alternative investment legislation , we will reduce the funds allocated by this organisation by two thirds .
The main concepts , without doubt , will be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; consistency &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; direct implementation &apos; .
There are certainly other means of overcoming the crisis , but I am sure that Commissioner Joaqu√≠n Almunia is prepared to discuss it later on another occasion .
I am in favour of this report because forests and the land land land account for more than 42 % of the European Union &apos;s territory and provide a livelihood for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector .
He knows perfectly well that these are , unfortunately , the governments of the Member States that decide on the location of the institutions , and unfortunately it is his party &apos;s former leader , John Major , led by John Majdinor , at the Edinburg Summit of 1992 that the European Parliament has a legal obligation to hold 12 sessions in Strasbourg .
The committee believed that pefluorex should not be included in the evaluation procedure at European level for certain types of deliberately falling agents .
We have always said that there is a need for reconciliation and for dialogue to continue .
It would make sense first of all to agree on the European Union 2020 strategy in general lines , and then to give the new Commission a budget review , so that the new College would be a full-blown author of the proposal and could work closely with you on the next financial perspectives .
Given the lack of a European policy to support the shipping sector , production is likely to fail to reach the levels it had until the current crisis .
It makes no sense to continue to insist that the Lisbon Strategy be developed at a time when the economic crisis is worsening on the social crisis that the application of this strategy has helped to create .
If we allow the status quo to be preserved , twenty years later , rail freight will have disappeared at all .
Furthermore , I cannot fail to point out that this report , in particular Mr Rangel , calls for a great deal of power in the negotiating process .
Since volcanic ash can lead to a halt to aircraft engines and make it difficult to see through aeroplane windows , Eurocontrol by the European Aerodrock Organisation for Safety stated its responsible position and passenger safety a key priority .
In addition , this package does not make health and environmental and competitiveness , and innovations , an opponent , as has all too often happened , but rather puts it in a similar situation .
I am very critical of the fact that manufacturers themselves voluntarily quantify these products .
The results of this analysis will be compiled in the discharge report on decent work , which will be published in 2011 .
I recognise that this is not perfect and there are some concerns .
Apart from the poverty that still exists , unfortunately , we also have to face global environmental problems , such as climate change , and now we are basically talking about a global insurance premium that would compensate the victims for the financial disaster with a social and economic transmission .
I would like to conclude by wishing Mr Kov√°cs much success in the future .
However , we do not support the parts of the text relating to increasing agricultural aid for EU producers through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity ( POSEI ) .
I think that , with these available functions , European diplomacy will be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the EU &apos;s fundamental interests , which also applies to energy security .
I would like to stress once again that EU citizens are watching with interest how we react to the famous Treaty of Lisbon &apos;s response .
We do not believe in the June List that the Multiannual Programme or the European Agency for linguistic Diversity and linguistic Diversity at EU level will create any difference for around 500 million European citizens , except even more burdens for taxpayers .
However , this legal act has , to a certain extent , become a factor - let us acknowledge this frankly - in the interinstitutional war that has been going on between the European Parliament and the Council for years .
You must agree that one of the reasons why the Commission is putting forward such a hasty , unreasonable and poorly prepared proposal that we in Europe and in other countries have to put up with is a lack of transparency .
Make this situation clear !
However , for the victims - the grieving families and the seriously wounded - it would be a small consolation if we were to continue to emphasise that the railways are the safest mode of transport and that the number of rail accidents is very low in comparison with road accidents .
However , we also call for the future EU-Canada Summit to resolve the problem of visa requirements , which the Canadian Government has partly restored to EU citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania .
The European Parliament has a different role to play .
It should not even be said that a new , rigorous system needs to be put in place in our neighbouring countries until we can , of course , finally get rid of the nightmare of nuclear power plants once and for all .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , in accordance with the Act on the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , I declare the first sitting of the European Parliament open after the elections .
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in a region that has been particularly turbulent for years .
Parliament has improved the document , underlining the importance of teaching law-enforcement professionals to cooperate more closely and to bring closer law enforcement agencies with mutual recognition and trust , so that we can integrate response mechanisms , making the European Union a real area of freedom , justice and security .
Is it really difficult to recognise that this should also happen in the case of the peoples of the Middle East ?
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , this debate is taking place at a very timely time for tourism , the air sector and consumer protection .
I therefore support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , which aim to balance the privacy and security of individuals on the Internet , with full respect for their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , this is a democracy - we are debating the issue , and this debate is interesting .
I am pleased that the European Parliament can finally enter the forest and discuss future orientations that should be accepted in this regard .
The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible ; this must be done now , so that the Roma can also benefit from this .
They must also be justified in guiding legitimate interests : national protection , public security , disorder or preventing criminal activity , health or moral protection , and so on .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I represent the Commission and , specifically , the High Commissioner .
We must act quickly , not only with regard to Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan - which we will soon be discussing - but also with regard to Iraq .
Finally , the ALDE Group is extremely disappointed that , on the eve of the summit , Russia has imposed a disproportionate ban on imports of vegetables from the EU .
This also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often dies the image of the EU , is not one EU institution , but the fault of the Member State itself .
This draft language law endangers the use of minority languages on a daily basis , for example , which also affects the representatives of the half a million local Hungarian minority living there .
in writing . - ( DE ) There is an unprecedented crisis in the dairy sector today : producers &apos; prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have risen and many farms in the European Union are struggling to survive .
We welcome the rejection of the European Commission &apos;s proposal , the President of this Commission , Mr Dur√£o Barroso , wants to exclude self-employed road transport servants from the directive on the organisation of working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , as a result of which our proposal is to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
In this respect , high-level European leaders , political parties , society in its demonstrations and European trade unions indicate that Eurobonds can be of key importance to overcoming the debt crisis and ensuring the stability of the euro .
We should not reduce these targets .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we want to raise the subject of non-tariff barriers .
SMEs are the driving force behind the European economy and contribute to sustainable growth , creating many high quality jobs .
Other factors have not been taken into account , such as giving German an appropriate role as the working language provided for in the treaties .
The longer the agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme is concluded , the higher the terrorist attack , which would otherwise have been possible to prevent .
Mr President , this debate is occurring again in Parliament .
This also means strengthening the education sector and investment in education , research and innovation , as a cornerstone of a sustainable social market economy and a more sustainable , greener economy .
Unfortunately , this resolution is much later than the statements by the Heads of State or Government and also by UN officials on the deployment of tens of thousands of large US military units in the country .
By continuing to expand , costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only rise .
This has not been done .
This seems to be a long process , but if the courageous people of Burma can learn something from us in this Parliament and in Europe , it is a matter of freedom that cannot be upset by tyranny , and that freedom to which they are an inalienable right will certainly one day belong will be to them .
It is necessary for these four countries to show solidarity against each other on this issue and not to promote a &apos; every man for himself &apos; approach .
The agenda will be followed by three documents on broadband : firstly , broadband communication , which outline the implementation of the broadband agenda in detail ; secondly , the recommendations on new generation access ( JPP ) , which aim to set out the substance in order to encourage rapid Internet investment ; and thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme based on the Commission &apos;s strategy to create a suitable range of frequencies .
The aim of this directive is sufficiently clear : we need more organs for patients , more cooperation between Member States on this issue and combating organ trafficking .
Too little was done in the banking rescue process to respond to this predictable development .
As far as production and employment are concerned , at present , there are only a few free nuances in the medium / higher categories , luxury and high-tech sectors .
Confidence is being undermined when , over the summer , the government applies the stress test to its banks and then realises in a few months &apos; time that it was actually a stress test for the euro , not for the banks .
I am pleased to welcome the adoption of this report because it is devoted to supporting research and innovation , which are the driving force behind the growth of the current and future of the European Union , it expresses the concerns of those who are most affected by it , namely , the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of the project , while strengthening the scientific evaluation process .
Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that the political parties and parliamentary groups that are opposed to such populism and demagoguery need to talk more about this .
With regard to current emergency measures , I would like to draw attention to the fact that increasing minimum subsidies from EUR 7500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems in those Member States with more difficult budgetary conditions .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 )
I would like to ask you whether , in your closing comments , you could mention some of these really topical issues , so that people understand that they are being discussed .
You just mentioned five points , but the context is lost - the fact that Europe 2020 will mean tackling economic issues , social issues and environmental issues - or at least we risk losing that .
These are not my words .
As a result , the majority of your peoples are in favour of adopting the Treaty of Lisbon , including it .
We must therefore be careful about this .
We must fight this kind of action and support those who are punished in this way .
I am sorry , but that is not possible .
I believe that restrictive measures and sanctions are important instruments for the EU &apos;s foreign and security policy , as well as , of course , in the areas of justice and defence of human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , which are the foundation of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I wish to raise one important issue regarding it .
We support this resolution with one objective , namely , to make it clear that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs will , in the long term , support the Haitian people in their national infrastructure and communication reconstruction .
We are determined to maintain our support for such measures and to continue this issue in the European Union , not only in the context of prevention and victim support , but also in the areas of immigration , asylum seekers and criminal law .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
When it comes to Guant√°namo , many EU Member States must take on the same blame , for example , as they allowed flights to be transported illegally .
According to this programme , trade policy remains a very important tool for exploiting the opportunities of globalisation and solving problems and promoting economic growth , jobs and prosperity for all European citizens .
For our part , therefore , let us say that obstacles need to be cleared .
I would like to mention another area that is causing concern , namely , the authorisation to import products from outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , then , someone understands that behind many measures there is a deliberate intention to conceal the unaccountability that still bears us in the institutions , including unclear legislation .
I would like to make a few political points , which are important because , according to what has been said here , Tunisia is a society governed by multiparty politics , albeit limited , and there is no doubt that there is a quota for opposition , but it is a policy of the various parties .
We had a problem with the name of 18 additional MEPs , because some Member States did not even plan the procedure , but we decided that representation was the most important thing that we have to respect , and that Parliament should ensure balanced representation as soon as possible .
As has already been mentioned here , sound use of land , economic and social development in line with nature and stronger cohesion in the European Union are also important elements for preventing disasters .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and look forward to further progress in this relationship .
The legal texts being discussed today not only define the framework and the basic guidelines , but also define the real , specific actions that still need to be taken .
Furthermore , I think that we need right now to go beyond this proposal , with regard to a greener internal market , for example , through green public procurement .
I refer to the importance of the amendment that emphasises the issue of observers , bearing in mind that these observers must be chosen among the main candidates who were not elected to the European Parliament elections .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but we have even more urgent problems today : the euro area and Greece .
Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) are , in fact , a very important sector because they represent a significant share of the European Union &apos;s economy , employing 7 % of the labour force - the European Union &apos;s labour force - and 6 % of GDP , which is essential to the EU economy , as well as to the European industry and to the workforce .
I think that we can expect a whole series of comfort initiatives , in which the European Commission will be asked to do more , to introduce more Europe and the Commission will undoubtedly respond with enthusiasm for this .
Because , if we do not take responsibility and do not give a clear line , we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier : we must be aware that , in 2020 , as we have indicated in the Digital Agenda , every European must have the opportunity to act in line with its interests , taking advantage of all the radio spectrum .
Such organisations make up their power base in response to the daily needs of the people , and then consolidate their power through terror .
Statements by the President
in writing . - I supported the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme because I believe that all European citizens should have more rapid broadband connections by 2020 .
Its disastrous exploitation of natural resources would be disastrous , not just for the surrounding area and for the indigenous population , but for the world as a whole .
( RO ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mrs Gy≈ëri on the mandate she has given at the moment and wish her and the Hungarian Presidency success .
We also need to address the issue of nanomaterials , and now that the aspect of cloning has been separate from this issue , we can move forward quickly .
Greater cooperation is particularly important in areas such as financial services , economic governance , Europe 2020 , energy and the internal market strategy .
With regard to emerging economies - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - they , too , are undertaking commitments at local level , which goes beyond the scientific community &apos;s demands .
The protocol provides for the annual financial contribution of the European Union to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe amounting to EUR 682 500 , of which EUR 227 500 will be channelled towards supporting the fisheries policy , which I think is appropriate .
We will see how this is going to be implemented in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take the measures taken in this area more seriously , although I am saddened and concerned that the representative of the Council will no longer attend this debate .
If we Europeans want to play an active role in this regard , it is important to continue to do so .
This report is another step forward which encourages the Council , the Commission and the Member States to take action on the issue of homelessness .
In the case of expulsion , for example , the family should be given the opportunity to choose to follow the expulsion or stay where they are .
This terrible treaty was colluded with and ratified on a day of August in the 1980s .
Negotiations with Japan aimed at strengthening trade relations cannot be used other than a weapon in a class fight to serve large financial institutions and companies that increasingly exploit the workers and peoples by destroying their productivity and damage to the environment .
We confirm that we will pass on what was promised and , as was promised by the IIA , the budget reforms by the end of this year .
Between July and August , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , only the mining industry in the east of the Congo became the victims of the group &apos;s rape , including children , girls and women , even the age of 75 .
Thus , the original draft report , which included the implementation of the House of European History &apos;s House of History with excessively high operating expenditure , was in complete contradiction to my firm belief in a reduction in budget expenditure for public funds .
After all , these are investments which will not bring instant profits , but which are being made to have a reserve .
I would also like to stress that we can help third countries , as the speaker said before me .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential , although it covers only 1 % of the national healthcare budget , because we should concentrate not on figures but on the symbolic force , i.e. every European citizen &apos;s legitimate right to seek treatment outside their home country and receive reimbursement of the treatment received using all the accurate information .
Nevertheless , I call for measures to be taken as an initial form of prevention to encourage the observance of healthy lifestyles , which is an essential factor in improving health .
Given the different legal frameworks of the Member States and the often limited ability to influence the implementation of international law in relation to combating violence , a clear and binding legal framework is required at EU level , as this problem is becoming increasingly evident .
What do you think about this unplanned commitment to the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure , are social values that many have been fighting for many years , including in Portugal .
I believe that we are the ones who can still save the planet .
In short , as we have already said so many times , we need a stable and well-financed cohesion policy , which is being implemented in all regions of the European Union .
In principle , I am partially dismayed by the same anxiety , and I also recognise the fact that Turkmenistan still has a great deal to do until it meets international standards in full in terms of democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of low labour costs in some countries , particularly China and India , which are having devastating consequences for countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen - and I am speaking in particular to the members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - there is no point in defending one or other group in Ukraine , depending on parties or political views .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom we have a very similar view to this programme , and secondly , to congratulate everyone involved , because it is essential , in this time of economic crisis , to maintain such a programme , which has an obvious positive social impact .
The Commission hopes that there will be a special relationship with Parliament on this issue as well .
Mr President , Commissioners , we must ensure that the promises made at the donor conference become real money in the future and actually reach the beneficiaries for whom they were intended .
This committee is creating a citizen-focused policy that is needed , particularly in the context of the crisis that we are going through .
The European Council must take the necessary preliminary measures , but should not draw any surprising conclusions .
If a number of companies were not opened in Portugal in a week &apos;s time , so many Portuguese would not be unemployed and would not be in poverty .
By setting up an investment fund , as proposed by the European Socialist Party , we would ensure that Member States suffering unfair attacks can receive support without being directly targeted at taxpayers and have lower periods of difference .
Of the new offences in 2007 , 1 196 cases were that no national measures to transpose Community directives were announced .
In my opinion , there is a need to introduce a balance between environmental protection , on the one hand , and the bureaucracy and costs incurred by industry and small equipment , such as farming and healthcare facilities , on the other .
The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of this strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating my friend , Mrs Weber , for her excellent work on this report .
I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission here share many priorities .
In fact , its international and inland road haulage is passed on to the large monopolies for a plan .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
If antibiotics are used in a lot of ways , it is not surprising that there is a strain of bacteria that does not react to antibiotics .
This directive does not accept the principle of protecting and safeguarding the protection and safeguarding of migrant workers who , forced to work under unacceptable conditions , report on them .
I am very pleased that we rejected a project that was only intended to get left-leaning to attack its political opponents in Italy .
You are absolutely right .
It is true that there was a very lively debate in the Council on the best way of ensuring that the peripheral Member States are not excluded , and a qualified majority came about over time in the Council , and I hope that this has also been demonstrated by this Parliament - and I think that this has been the case .
By adopting Amendment 43 , Amendment 54 will not be abolished , as there are other issues in Amendment 54 which are not covered by Amendment 43 .
Order of business
Climate change is not the only environmental challenge we face , but it is imperative that we try to tackle it in Copenhagen .
However , there is no need for a new structure to ensure this or to define and monitor the conditions .
( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position that will be taken at the G20 summit .
We should consider whether we do not need new sources of income ; in this case , we should not look for anything other than those who have always made a profit from this incomprehensible situation .
in writing . - As a fervent opponent of our life , I have consistently voted against most of the reports that I have been asked to consider .
It unduly cost the British people one million jobs .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tool that the European Parliament is increasingly using at the moment due to the difficult situation of economic convergence that our continent is going through .
I demand that this judge , Judge Afiuni , and all the prisoners in Venezuela , be treated with respect and that a fair trial be held consciously .
Some honourable Members asked about Gaza , about the need to make sure that aid is delivered , that we continue to support people in Gaza - as we do - but we are engaged in dialogue to intensify and improve aid .
I also voted for this report because it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fairer funding system for the European Union .
Although the European Union must establish relations with the Russian Government , we must constantly remind this government that we demand a democratic state and a democratic ethnous , and that attempts to try and try to try and exert any views that are unacceptable to the government or to put politicians under unfair pressure will not be acceptable to the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , in Copenhagen , Europe &apos;s great powers were unable to cooperate with major powers such as the US , China , India and Brazil .
Mr President , honourable Members , I am convinced that research and innovation are not only an opportunity for Europe , but a necessity if we are to find a long-term solution for safeguarding our model and for environmental sustainability .
It is clear that its aim is to maintain raw materials while seeking more attractive exchange rates for its exports .
You can do so .
Developing countries are right : they have not caused the crisis .
The European Union should also support such practices , by taking possible technical action at the appropriate time and by complementing UN sanctions and , at the same time , by approving its readiness to engage in debate and dialogue , which should never be abandoned , even at difficult times .
Given that the existing directive , as it stands , is not sufficiently effective to prevent late payment , I also support strengthening the existing rules .
Since then , it has mainly become clear to us that the US is much more prepared to listen to these reservations and look for constructive solutions to Europe &apos;s objections than we had intended .
In fact , Commissioner Rehn said here that before authorisation of the general elections , they first had to approve the budget .
I would like to make a rather strange point : in the United States , there is a ban on the use of ancillary substances , but the European Medicines Agency has allowed this to happen , as most vaccines contain the size of the disease .
The most effective instrument of the European Union for combating unemployment is the European Social Fund , whose rules we are now essentially simplifying significantly in order to speed up payments .
I think that we must now wait for this package to be transposed ; implement it and see how it works , and only then decide whether other measures are needed .
It has , in addition , included the creation of new areas for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of mercenaries ; the fight against the production , trafficking and accumulation of small arms and anti-immigration weapons ; and cooperation .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy .
The first is that , despite the concerns and fears felt by people , we must not forget the principles .
The resolution expresses and criticises the measures that have been introduced by the present government , but it does not mention the fact that the current town of Naples is Mrs Iagles &apos;s centre left and , what is worse , has also forgotten the long time for Commissioner Bassolino , who was in Naples between 1993 and 2000 , who did so much of the special obligations of Naples and 2000 .
Road and fight once again for democracy .
In addition to what has already been said about the precautionary principle and the important traceability - which must be a priority - it is also about how could there be no evidence of this alert that Spanish cucumbers were guilty ?
On this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report is not enough : it still lays down too many conditions for prior approval , making it difficult for Member States .
The future of this region needs strong , tolerant democracies that respect minorities , where the country has been promised everyone and is not used unjustifiably by only a few .
I very much hope that , on 1 January 2011 , Estonia will join the euro area in order to find a way to secure economic growth and resolve the financial difficulties .
The vast majority of stakeholders , including professional associations , therefore agree to the possibility of using only English .
The only way to go for working men and women to be subjected to decisions by the European Union and its institutions , and to disregard for these decisions .
Political dialogue has also been suspended .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to propose an oral amendment for a separate vote on paragraph 10 concerning the following passage : &apos; believes that the inclusion of this concept in the protocol on additional standards for racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and any discrimination would not be appropriate &apos; .
We need to raise this objective , and we will increase it , but only when conditions apply .
It is essential that we in the European Union act on the TAGAD .
As far as financial services are concerned , I agree that it is necessary for service providers to introduce a certain degree of transparency , but I do have some concerns about the wording used in your draft .
The budget on which this report is based - which is clearly set out in the preamble to the compromise proposal for an end to the milk quota - is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against .
Madam President , this is indeed very good news .
We will do our utmost to clarify this issue .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to point out that I cannot say my speech in Catalan , because it is not yet an official language , even though more than 10 million European citizens speak in this language .
The European Union must modernise its energy infrastructure and ensure interconnections between Member States &apos; energy infrastructure .
If Russia is unable to accept Ukraine &apos;s political strand , it must live up to the loss of political influence over the Soviet bloc countries .
In this context , I would like to remind you of the decision taken yesterday in plenary , with which we rejected the resolution on the case of Aminatou Haidar , so as not to jeopardise the diplomatic negotiations that are currently under way .
Mr President , we are talking about the situation in Belarus , but let us not pass on all the responsibility to others .
The main producer countries , which are supported by the majority of those who are sensitive to the arguments of the manufacturing industry , have managed to ensure that we do not set ambitious emission reduction targets .
We had excellent cooperation on this report , which I think is very successful and gives a clear idea of the direction in which this Parliament wants to see the CAP post 2013 clearing itself .
The example of the United States shows us that flexibility is not synonymous with the word &apos; insecurity &apos; , but rather with the word &apos; dynamic labour market &apos; .
As President of the European Commission , I will be supporting the principles set out in your resolution just now .
We must send out a clear message of responsibility to those who hold the future of this key treaty of the European Union , our institutions and the 500 million Europeans we represent .
These are all examples of the benefit of research into animals .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , because in addition to the EUR 146 million that have been agreed on and whose impact will hopefully be eight more , this initiative has important symbolic significance .
I believe that the spirit of European culture is an important way of bringing Europeans closer to their different cultural and linguistic identities in full respect .
I believe that it is very important to promote not only competitiveness in the agricultural sector , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution .
Special derogations were also allowed in remote rural areas and islands , such as my constituency of Orkney and the islands of Szetland .
The political guidelines implemented harm the citizens and make them frustrated , while decision-making procedures do not encourage them to participate , as demonstrated by the recent European elections .
As far as delays are concerned , you are right : there are delays .
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond urgently to the legitimate request made by the petitioner , stating that this unacceptable situation has been dragging on for 13 years and that the petitioner has suffered significant loss of earnings and is asking for the necessary measures to assert his rights .
These objectives can be achieved through full support , effective implementation mechanisms and sufficient compliance with existing legislation and instruments relating to the protection of human rights and civil liberties .
Never before has the European project been subjected to such a difficult test .
What do we intend to do when the Americans , alongside the collapse of the dollar &apos;s shop , sell their fuel mixtures , the subsidised and heavily advertised chickens on our markets , which are already on the edge of Turkish , Indian and Chinese grassroots classes of vehicles ?
Mr President , I would like to hear your assessment of the EU-Ukraine Summit , which took place almost two weeks ago .
We demand common solutions for Europe .
As some of my fellow Members have already pointed out , if these points were to be clarified , the Commission would be asked to consult the European Parliament during the mandate .
It is very important that we , as Europeans , ensure that we also convey a European message to Belarus , thus offering this country hope .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy , which has been promised to us , is more or less the same old policy , which sometimes disappears into widespread democracy .
It is obvious that the measures only offer a solution to the problem of partial , incomplete immigration and undeclared labour force .
Do not make any illusions : we are talking very clearly , I am speaking very clearly with all the leaders , I am talking about what I think should happen , and I do so with the support of Parliament and with the support of the 27 Member States &apos; Foreign Affairs Council .
I am not exaggerating : in one of these reports , it is deemed necessary to state that , in the event that the majority changes are taking place as a result of the elections , the new government must be allowed to obtain permission before changing the priorities of the previous government &apos;s budget , and even then only minor changes can be made .
What is even better , in the meantime , while our differences of political opinions have naturally remained the same , our relations as people have become considerably richer .
This is why , Commissioner , we believe it is important to do more than simply to implement the pilot project you mentioned .
In fact , nuclear energy is set in such a way that each country has a nuclear safety regulator that is fully responsible for implementing nuclear safety measures .
But it is interesting that , while several countries do have problems due to the financial crisis , it is also true - and I think Mr Lamberts will appreciate this - in most countries that are not in a position to take a stable stand with regard to finances , there is no Socialist Government .
Several scenarios are possible : taken power from power by force supporting peaceful democracy to economic chaos and armed conflict outbreak , and not even nuclear weapons can be excluded .
in writing . - ( DE ) Neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer &apos;s disease or seamal dementia , will continue to spread in our ageing society .
On the question of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and on the subject of changes in the European Social Fund , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation that has been so constructive that achieving our goals is real and I think that this is very important .
What do you think about the fact that once a Member State has submitted an application to the EGF , it is being urged to initiate measures that it has applied to the EGF , because that would not result in workers waiting at least for the fund &apos;s approval ?
These strategies and programmes cannot remain on paper alone , because then they merely serve to highlight the inconsistencies and lack of confidence in the laws that the European Union has itself adopted .
I find it difficult to imagine how people can be satisfied by putting this despotic regime on hold and supporting amendments that enable Iran to combat and weaken the opposition movement , which is defending human rights and democracy in Iran .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law because I do not believe that Brussels needs to adopt legislation on areas where there is already national legislation .
With his election as President , there was hope and a change - not only for the United States , but also for the whole of the world , but also for Europe .
In this context , I support the proposals put forward by the Commission to Parliament ; many of them have already been discussed in my report on the rules governing the movement of people across borders .
However , we oppose the wording of paragraph 8 , which provides for the gradual and drastic reduction in the tax burden from medium- to low-income pensions through tax accounts , the review and compensation policy on account of the perverse effects of financial policy .
In many cases where a country government has not been engaged in dialogue or programmes to improve the situation in question for a long time , resolutions appropriate to each country are the only way of acting against these crimes by the international community .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not know the position of the new Parliament .
However , these exceptions are only applicable if they are justifiable because of the importance of security policy .
Co-Chairs also called on the LTTTE to lay down its arms , but unfortunately , this call has been rejected or even ignored .
I agree that it is necessary to use the opportunity to call for structural reforms in countries with budget surpluses , but we must nevertheless focus on countries with deficits .
I would therefore ask for a roll-call vote on the second part of paragraph 12 to be imposed .
Nevertheless , I am pleased that Parliament , by such a clear majority , has shown its commitment to resolving this issue as we have just decided .
This is a European route and may differ from the path of other countries .
The European veterinary anti-bacterial consumption project ( EUVAC ) was launched in the third quarter of 2009 .
Given the importance of research for economic development and job creation , it is important , with every possible means , to avoid excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays that discourage the scientific community from participating .
The banks are now with a positive balance sheet and are , however , praised when they start to support Greece on a voluntary basis .
This document proves that the transposition of EU law by Member States is progressing ever better .
The best way to reduce the population &apos;s growth is to help young people survive so that there is no need for large families .
I therefore welcome the proposal to set clear rules for the definition of the aforementioned wine products , so that the high quality of European products is always recognised and identified .
The initiative will only be successful if it is easy to implement and accessible to all .
I think that particular attention needs to be paid to Corridor No 7 .
We therefore warmly welcome this communication , which demonstrates new ambition in the area of single market policy , enabling us to restore confidence in our model of the social market economy .
( The speaker agrees to take a question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As you will certainly know , the second round of presidential elections took place in Ukraine on Sunday .
The Hungarian Government should ensure effective guarantees of freedom and pluralism in the media and therefore abolish the law or modify its substance based on observations and proposals from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights , the Council of the European Union and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights , with open and transparent debates in which all stakeholders , non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) and citizens .
The Treaty of Law for Europe was imposed without proper democratic control .
I would also like to remind my liberal fellow Members , and Mr Rohde in particular , that the reason why he was in favour of free trade was its disastrous effects , as he claimed that British Cypriot interests were led by shameful interests is not very important for Indian society to speed up the maturity of the world revolution .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya &apos;s actions go against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of Human and People &apos;s Rights of People &apos;s and People &apos;s peoples .
Firstly , civil protection is a matter for the Member States , and all the coordination initiatives must be built on this .
The UN Special Rapporteur on the death penalty , without trial in 2008 , wrote that &apos; these murderers of civil society , including human rights defenders , trade unionists and actors , intimidated many representatives of civil society and narrowed the political talks in the country &apos; .
I do not agree with the previous speaker , because I believe that if we really do adopt the Treaty of Lisbon , this will enable us to connect citizens with the EU in a much more important way .
We have achieved the highest level of production of civilisation and weapons , higher than during the Cold War , which has nothing to do with pragmatic policies aimed at demilitarisation .
This will allow us to say that we will introduce real and effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States .
I believe that we really have got control , and I hope this is a good message that I will take with myself if an equal majority of Parliament follows our example tomorrow - that we really have ensured control .
In addition , we have tried as clearly as possible to express our desire to support not only public broadcasters with high-quality , attractive content , but also to integrate new platforms in the light of the latest technologies .
Madam President , two years ago , in December 2008 , we had a problem in Ireland .
Although we cannot expect miracles from this agreement , it is a step in the right direction and I have therefore voted in favour of this report .
Once again , it is an intergovernmental instrument established by ECOFIN , which requires unanimity .
This is contrary to the actual objective of regional aid , which is to strengthen the weaker regions .
One symbol , one conclusion - on that we should all work together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , only if the Libyan authorities make a clear commitment can we give the necessary substance to their actions .
In this way , we are , of course , already giving a strong signal to the authorities , which will have to be restored in the future : this is , of course , Parliament and also the Commission .
There is also a risk that the short-term criminals can adapt to the profiles set up using the selection of safe individuals , such as drug smugglers or terrorists or change travel routes , choosing routes that are not monitored .
Another important element is greater access to schools , to a higher level of vocational and academic training , and to improving social conditions for women in rural areas .
However , there are other challenges .
EPAs will not be satisfactory unless they promote regional integration and contribute to the development of the ACP countries and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
In my opinion , the most important issue in this regard is the need to adopt the new budget for Europe and the European Union for the coming years .
The EU must give top priority to research and innovation in order to meet challenges such as climate change and to find solutions to ever-increasing global competition .
Europe &apos;s thoughts are divided on this .
This is good news , and we must thank all those responsible for implementing this directive in the Member States and perhaps also in the regions .
According to the United Nations , 20-40 % of the world &apos;s timber and its products are illegally extracted .
I know she is going to leave , and although we are not always in agreement on the issues , I think everyone agrees that she has put a tremendous amount of work into this report .
This proposal , which is supported by the European Council , has long been awaited by all those who are fighting for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities , especially the Roma .
If this is not done , every decision this Parliament will be taken in the composition of 754 Members will be illegal , as the limit set - 751 - will exceed three Members .
However , not so long ago , we discussed the Digital Agenda ; we all agree with the Digital Agenda and this is a very important issue for the implementation of the Digital Agenda .
I would like to thank you for making this debate a truly joint debate .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the ICTY is a prerequisite for joining the EU , but the truth , as I was told yesterday evening by Commissioner Rehn without being able to attend , is that there is no consensus in the Council on what that means .
The Arctic Council has focused mainly on environmental cooperation and research , but agreements on the use of natural resources have created an increasing need for international administration strategies , and the EU could also play a role in this respect .
However , I strongly support a very rigorous approach to access to this profession for road hauliers .
Since we opened up our markets when we joined the European Union , we are paying the same amount of money into the budget and there are many other things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , Europe does not have mechanisms or institutions capable of coordinating an integrated continent &apos;s recovery , and that is why we are once again imposing a more predatory solution that may not be effective in general , because the economies of the Member States are very interlinked .
I would just like to add that , when we look at our internal communication , we set clear rules on price stability , enabling everyone to take stock of our work at the appropriate time .
On the issue of legal training , the Council shares the same opinion as Parliament : it is necessary , among other things , to promote a genuine EU legal culture , promoting direct exchanges of judges , prosecutors and legal personnel from various Member States , and actively developing the European Judicial Training Network .
We must make a joint effort in this direction in the future .
However , that was not the case .
However , I would like to remind the House - and this is something that we have recently encountered in Greece - that even now there are individuals who have been convicted of serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union , but who manage to go unpunished and avoid being detained using various procedural rules and different provisions in several national laws .
There was also a general framework where individual elements can complement each other and strengthen each other .
- Before the vote :
The most important message to the Member States from our debate today should be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria as the European Union requested from the countries that have acceded to date .
European contract law , which has been debated for a long time in the institutions , could bring numerous advantages for businesses , consumers and a successful functioning internal market .
It is politically unacceptable for this report , which contains incorrect facts , to be voted in plenary today ( 24 November 2009 ) .
Of course , on the one hand , we cannot criticise the United States for years on the Guant√°namo detention centre but , on the other hand , show little will or ambition to help them resolve this problem .
We therefore voted against .
The migration resulting from the crisis and instability is having a negative impact on countries of origin , destination countries and displaced peoples .
Madam President , I do not know what actually happened , but I would like to speak as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) .
As far as Serbia is concerned , individuals of permanent residence in Kosovo or persons of Kosovan origin living abroad who have a Serbian passport issued by the central authority in Belgrade will not be subject to visa liberalisation , and they will need a visa .
Passengers must be guaranteed the right to choose the reimbursement of the ticket price or to continue travelling under the same conditions and without additional allowances .
Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets , which are actually implemented .
I submitted this question on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism because Members were deeply concerned by the collapse of the airline company SkyEurope during the summer and asked me to take this initiative on their behalf .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , we need to overcome the growing difference between life expectancy and retirement age .
Proposals :
We are now discussing whether we believe that we can obtain all the details in Mexico , including the form of the agreement .
The OSCE is actively using the Council of Europe as the main and most important forum for democracy ( in this respect the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights , which supports the monitoring of elections ) , to discuss matters of human rights and the rule of law in a European context .
The compromise is a good one , and I very much hope that it will receive broad support in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
It is not a long time since I reminded the House that the Belarusian elections are not free , that there is no freedom of expression , fear and freedom of protest in Belarus , and that there has been an increase in the number of repressive actions led by the institutions .
The claim must be scientifically sound , taking into account the scientific data available and assessing the evidence .
This information is , of course , very important to patients and to health professionals , but it must be subject to strict rules as a result of the possible abuse of advertising .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the recurrence of accidents and the ever-increasing transportation of hazardous goods by sea continually raises sharp questions about even more stringent safety regulations , which manage all the bottlenecks in the European Union and the resources necessary to comply with these rules .
The second subject is nuclear energy .
Then there will be a technical chapter , which includes finalising all this in a legally binding text .
It is therefore vital that social standards clauses in bilateral agreements be included more and more frequently .
This is a great opportunity to put this position into practice .
Tuesday :
In order to encourage this practical cooperation , the 2008 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum demanded the establishment of a Asylum Support Office , which was approved in the Stockholm Programme for 2009 .
We celebrated paragraph 8 March this week .
Madam President , I thank the honourable Member for his remark , but I would like to inform him that I am a representative of Poland and not of Lithuania .
Mr President , I am pleased that , in plenary , it is still possible to present the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ; that was not the case a few weeks ago .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Garc√≠a P√©rez , Mrs J√∂ns and Mr Angelakas , who have presented excellent reports and all those Members who have spoken .
I know that these events were followed by many Members of this Parliament , as well as our esteemed national parliaments across Europe .
We will therefore once again ask Russia to do everything in its power to ensure that human rights defenders can do their job without continuing fear of violence , torture or attacks .
Furthermore , unnecessary complications can undermine the legitimacy and the popularity of the process associated with the accession of the EU to the convention .
Opening of the sitting
I believe that we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government , which has many other things to deal with : its own refugees - as has already been said - and overseeing its democratic transition process .
We must continue with the implementation of the economic , social and territorial cohesion policy in order to reduce the disparities between the regions and create a platform for balanced economic development , which is also enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The vote is resumed .
Google , the human rights defenders , accused Google of assisting the Chinese Government in repression of its citizens and , in particular , human rights defenders .
The main issue at this moment is to amend the proposal directive as soon as possible and to start implementing it as possible .
Faced with such a situation , as I would suggest in the past that , when participating in the European Parliament and based on the principles of the Euromed and EuroLat Assembly , the Eastern Neighbourhood Assembly is set up , Euroeast , which would aim to implement the ENPI in Eastern European countries .
The main issue we need to discuss is financing the European budget and the future financial perspectives .
We must inform our citizens of what this means and how they can use the instruments that we are providing them with this directive so that they are not victims of misleading medicines when they buy falsified medicines as a result of fraud .
It is very important to create a level playing field for credit rating agencies , stimulating competition , transparency , market opening and stability .
It is estimated that at present , between 200 000 and 300 000 children are directly involved in armed conflicts in more than 20 countries around the world .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an evaluation of the Copenhagen climate conference , despite what many speakers have said that this conference was a total fiasco .
These improvements are critical for the future of the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) .
Commissioner , you referred to the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the green economy , and you know that this European strategy has failed .
No , it wants to continue paying export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , every country must take into account its origin and whether its development in the area of human rights and the rights of minorities is heading in the right direction .
It is also necessary to encourage fishing companies to use the best available selective equipment to date and thus prevent such large-scale catch and fish that are not targeted or catch them .
We will continue to push in this direction .
The Commissioner rightly pointed out that our main competitors and economic partners have been imposing a origin mark on goods coming into their territory for many years .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 20 May , at 12 noon .
While the EU supports the Copenhagen proposals for the further deindustrialisation of the West and for the domination of the Third World corporative , increasing numbers of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite chequation - the reason for levying taxes and controlling us - and imposing internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of nation states .
Furthermore , we are constantly in touch with third countries , especially Russia , to call for the abolition of the ban , which we consider disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Hahn , the proposals that we are now discussing can be compared with the great backbone that we are embarking on to those who are already hard enough to saddle them with this heavy burden even more quickly .
Once again , I congratulate them on their courage and determination .
At the same time , the irresponsible budgetary policy pursued so far by several Member States will obviously continue to be persecuted by the European Union for the next few years .
The first reason is that science is the sector with the world &apos;s role , and the achievements with which we participate make a contribution to people &apos;s common work .
I would say : we do not need more rules .
By facing a free fall in resistance rates and by brutal austerity measures that have had a severe impact on living standards , the Romanian Government is currently resorting to very violent anti-democratic methods in order to maintain power .
Let us return to utopianism , which is about peace .
We believe that the European Union is still on the right track and , through monitoring and transparency , we want to guarantee that the target of a 20 % reduction in emissions is achieved and that mistakes in Europe are not made .
Similarly , this White Paper proposes more funding for projects in this area , namely the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the EU Public Health Programme , Youth and Citizenship programmes , as well as the Lifelong Learning Programme .
Given that there are only seven people in committee and that their role is very responsible , it is important that they are people with perfect reputation and high abilities .
Even if we cannot offer them the opportunity to become Member States in the near future , we should develop economic and political cooperation for the common good of Europe .
Following the public consultation held last year , the Commission assesses the comments on collective redress and wants to find a solution that meets the needs of European consumers , without taking over US practices .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best form of active dialogue with European citizens is that based on their hearing in democratic votes .
I think that the debate this evening has shown an enormous consensus in Parliament , for example , on the need to appoint a special EU coordinator for Tibet .
I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities in EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens .
This is a good example and a benchmark , and the lessons of the second poorest country on the planet - when we brought the court to the table , we saw the motto &apos; is not peace without justice &apos; .
In this situation , cooperation between the EU and the Council is essential to meeting energy needs and to prevent an increase in oil prices on the global market .
If we fail to give a clear answer to these questions , both objectives relating to growth in employment and the reduction of poverty are expected to be the same as the Lisbon Strategy .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said : &apos; I am not talking about this so as not to worry the European institutions &apos; .
I hope that 2010 will be a success for Croatia as well as for the Western Balkans , but I would also like to stress the need to take into account and address properly the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons .
I know that this is not easy .
Madam President , I , too , would like to call for this proposal to be rejected and for the Commission to present a new choice of legal basis .
The text includes many review clauses to ensure that it works , but I would like to echo what Diana Wallis said , that exceptions were very important for reaching a compromise .
The Commission &apos;s position is to be supported : it defines the responsibility of the Member States for the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel , including disposal , for the countries themselves , to develop programmes .
I think that this text offers another instrument that the EU could use , because it outlines a coherent and effective policy on migration flows , enabling the most suitable means of creating conditions for political , economic and social stability to be chosen .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the speakers for their support and comments , including those who are against the report .
Our third aim is to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for the SME sector .
At the same time , Ukraine needs to accelerate the pace of reforms .
I would like to highlight the concerns expressed by the rapporteur , which is a cross-group concern , the commitment to young people .
We use our powers to promote these rights and freedoms on the basis of the Treaties , and we will continue to do so in the future .
The number of errors has fallen , but we have not yet reached a &apos; tolerable error level &apos; .
Too many children live in poverty and face health and education problems caused by poverty .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , when this Europe 2020 programme is presented as an excellent strategy for overcoming the crisis , it is beginning to recall a political provocation .
We have decided on five objectives between social inclusion ; this is a matter for the European Union under the Treaty .
Recently , we had the opportunity to see the importance of the problem of our legislation , as several million households across the European Union changed their CRT television broadcasters against modern LCD screens .
We must invest in neighbouring countries , especially those from the east of the EU , and give them the incentives they need to continue with their reforms and be able to strengthen the EU &apos;s presence in the area .
Given the rapid increase in such equipment and its impact on human health and the environment if it is not treated at the end of its life , it is important to set the most effective criteria .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of information on prescription-only medicines is a sensitive subject , as it has an important impact on the health and welfare of all citizens .
The President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , is responsible for the financial , economic , food and environmental crisis that Europe has plunged into .
Firstly , I would like to thank Mrs Maria Martens , who has produced an excellent report on the progress made on the EU-Africa strategy .
I cannot fail to stress the need to ensure the quality of products sold internally in Europe and to guarantee safety for those who use them .
These conclusions underline that we must learn lessons from the disaster in Japan and review the safety situation of the EU nuclear power plants and carry out stress tests .
This report takes a broad approach to the forestry issue , focusing on specific aspects that we consider important .
The Commissioner said this was foreseen in the context of the Geneva Agreement ; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114 .
It is obvious that most of the tasks will be undertaken by the Serbian and Macedonian Government , and as Mrs Malmstr√∂m said , that is precisely these that they should provide information to their citizens .
In view of the difficult market situation and the discussions that have begun on the future of agricultural policy in the European Union , Parliament must make a clear commitment to providing the necessary safety for all areas of agriculture with the aim of enabling workers to plan for the future .
What measures does the Commission intend to adopt to respond to these activities of credit rating agencies ?
It is important to stress the fact that volunteering undoubtedly has a positive impact on the development of the European identity , which is rooted in this value , and is a good basis for establishing a mutual understanding between the representatives of the various social groups and the countries of the entire European public .
Ladies and gentlemen , the proposal amending the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is one of the most important documents that Parliament has adopted , which both increases the quality of life of European citizens and contributes to the EU &apos;s economic recovery .
The previous Presidency promised Belgium that Parliament would be involved in the debate on this Multiannual Financial Framework .
Based on boxing new market players can , in certain cases , be a suitable instrument , but only by avoiding unnecessary procedures - that is how we can get closer to one another .
Nobody understands this , but if these amendments were adopted , the result would be completely the opposite .
Development of the European External Action Service ( debate )
If you go into the desperate and manifest words , the aim will become clear : the EU does not accept the assertion of sovereignty and the definition of its independent policy , which does not verge the interests of the EU , NATO and the US , and is trying to overcome it .
This report recommends , in particular , the following measures : the promotion of the education and training of health staff and secondary medical staff , paying particular attention to hospital infections and resistants to the virus that creates these infections , the improvement of knowledge of these problems among patients , asking the Commission to produce a document based on the World Health Organisation ( WHazardous Technologies ) and on the Effects of Nuredit Profestation in 2003 .
Verification of credentials : see Minutes
Violence acts from both sides must be maintained in order to allow for the opening of a transparent dialogue in good faith , ending a conflict that has already caused too many deaths and , as a result , there are still large numbers of displaced persons and refugees .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is still not clear how the Council could handle this issue as smoothly as possible .
Although the EU budget is the main driver of policy , the ceiling for own resources has not changed since 1993 .
As these islands depend on tourism and as tourism decreases , the threat of unemployment increases and the risk of collapse of small and medium-sized enterprises , which would have particularly severe consequences for the residents of these remote islands .
That is why some assertions need to be included in the form of amendments .
I have been told this by a Norwegian doctor who works every day and throughout the night ( we send doctors to Gaza ) .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , first let me join you in honouring Jean Monnet .
We must not allow this political crisis and this tension to continue .
Care is about the distribution of CAP resources among farmers in the European Union , which is at the centre of the public dialogue agenda .
I voted against the report , however , because although the general system is correct , some points recommended by my colleague are unacceptable .
However , I agree with those amendments tabled by the European Parliament that remove the recommendations of automatic sanctions against Member States facing excessive deficits , because , as this crisis has shown , it is necessary , in exceptional circumstances , to go beyond the deficit requirements in order to prevent more serious economic consequences of the crisis .
This tragic situation is currently in Lampedusa , and it is truly tragic .
The problems that have arisen as a result of the implementation of these regulations caused a contradiction with regard to the application of the principle of non-eligibility to tax , duties and other fiscal payments , the Union &apos;s costs .
The Spring European Council is approaching , and I would like to see the approval of all the ambitious goals .
Its President , Mr Maystadt , organised a conference two days ago in which he showed how much the EIB has spent since the start of the crisis - by around EUR 10 billion more than last year .
The possibility for Member States to adopt rules and measures that are more effective than those provided for in the agreement is equally desirable ( I would also say &apos; necessary &apos; ) .
Mr Oettinger , you are currently working on the Energy Roadmap 2050 .
The system that provides for the British rebates , which are also looking for the Netherlands and Denmark , has gone bankrupt .
We will also talk about a joint response to economic problems .
The correct political response is not to open up our markets or to monitor imports .
With today &apos;s vote , Parliament has adopted the mandate for the trialogue on the 2012 draft budget .
This report and the debate are a valuable contribution to the pre-days when we can look into it in depth .
I was therefore happy to support Mr Papanikolaou &apos;s resolution today .
I would like to hear from the Commission whether this will be included in the text of the communication adopted and whether or not obligations will be laid down in accordance with the Member States , which will be accompanied by the rules on services of general interest that are to be developed in consultation with the European Parliament and the Council .
We should have set a derogation limit , but we did not do so , and now we should continue and hopelessly look forward to success .
The Chilean authorities have not yet made requests , but , of course , that they could move towards reconstruction according to both positions .
It is to be hoped that the Commission and the Council will cooperate consistently in drawing up these guidelines and , furthermore , will do so as a good enough , because another , even recent , awareness of this urgency has unjustifiably failed .
Basically , its intention is to show the Communists , their actions and their ideals in criminal light .
However , if we are Scottish , this volcano could do even more harm to the European economy than the forecast shows .
Current growth indicators suggest that women will only achieve equal participation in 280 .
I also heard others saying &apos; Rokas nost &apos; - the market itself will deregulate , we do not need that .
Finally , with regard to the amendments tabled , I would like to advise the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , which voted against these amendments , even before we were able to approve the report as it stands .
Mr President , I would like to express my solidarity and heartfelt support for the people of Chile following the terrible earthquake and the tsunami they faced in Concepci√≥n , Biobio , Temuko and Valparaiso .
However , this is not just about structures and regulations , but also about mentality .
The latest statistics indicate that the EU recorded a trade deficit of EUR 17.3 billion in August 2008 .
After all , these promises will be crucial to the gradual resumption of our budget support programmes .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Reference for a protocol to the EU-Morocco Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector ( motion for a resolution tabled ) : see Minutes
That in itself was a challenge .
This is a clear sign that we are unable to survive alone in times of crisis and ensure the well-being of our citizens .
In many respects , I respect the fundamental position of my group .
It is a big step forward , an operation of this kind is a big step in the right direction .
Can the Commission state to what extent it will take account of these rulings , which once again demonstrate the unwillingness of the airlines to act , the title of Regulation No 261 / 2004 does not go too far in terms of &apos; exceptional circumstances &apos; , and of the Commission &apos;s passivity in the face of numerous infringements of this regulation that harm passengers ?
We all know that freedom of the media is being repressed in several Member States ( see the most recent report on the press freedom index published yesterday by Reporters without Borders ) .
I have always felt most secure in choosing an average platform .
The current Commission , through its mandate , has launched several initiatives for the involvement of civil society organisations and individual citizens in the public debate on EU issues .
- ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Economic Partnership Agreement between the Cariforum countries and the European Union initiates something undesirable to the outermost regions of France &apos;s Anti-Country and Guyana .
This is an urgent matter .
We are part of a community of peoples that guarantees citizens &apos; rights , strives for peace and prosperity and wants to live in peace .
( LT ) Madam President , I think that the evaluation of the Services Directive is an excellent opportunity to make sure that this directive really does contribute to greater development of the services market and to proper implementation by Member States of the provisions of this directive .
I welcome the measures proposed by the European Commission to help Europe &apos;s dairy farmers .
I think that we should stop doing one thing : laugh Greece .
Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act , as it is detected by the resistance of the European Council , which is too well known by the Commission .
That is why I voted for the report on the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions .
It is important to manage this , and the resolution adopted today by the European Parliament helps to do so .
The Commission will use the results of the work of the European Institute for Gender Equality in this area , which will be obtained by collecting and analysing data and statistical information .
Moreover , these measures would harm the Union &apos;s external trade policy , which would result in the conclusion of a free trade agreement - bilateral or multilateral - becoming even more difficult .
However , since the report makes very sound arguments in this regard , I voted in favour .
Because a country that calls itself a free-world leader cannot renounce these values for the sake of comfort , albeit with reasonable security for reasons .
As rapporteur - and I will be supported by the Committee on Development - I cannot agree with the use of Article 179 as a legal basis .
The fact that you can take the floor shows that this is a free and democratic European Parliament !
In the case of the Committee on Economic and Social Affairs , the audit carried out by the Court of Auditors failed to reveal any serious inconsistencies .
I would also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that we also adopted the report by Mr Peneda and Mrs Lambert .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr Leterme , when you presented the Belgian Presidency &apos;s programme in July last year , I welcomed you , I said in a joy , that perhaps you will still be here in January to present the results .
We are pleased that our ban on the use of CMR substances has been retained and adapted accordingly .
I welcome the swift action of the Commission and Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive as soon as possible .
It symbolises solidarity and national egoism .
In view of the global financial crisis and the increasing level of consumer debt , active dialogue with European citizens means that the European institutions and civil society must strive to improve the level of financial education of consumers , especially with regard to rights and obligations , as well as best practices relating to savings and loans .
A framework agreement will be drawn up and a rapid decision-making mechanism on the size of the aid will then also be drawn up .
We cannot allow political arguments to hinder enlargement .
1 . - It is time to know all the media operating on the Internet .
There is no contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach , between merits and quotas , between old and new Member States .
Do not expect me to vote for an increase in the budget ever .
I voted in favour of this report so that these objectives can be pursued in the near future , promoting harmonious growth , not only in various sectors , but also in European regions , which are often characterised by inequality at territorial level .
We would like to ask for your support for our request to mention these burning journalists and freedom and human rights activists in Chechnya , following a minute &apos;s silence .
It is very important to define the VAT system and a common consolidated corporate tax base more clearly .
Today , there are as many people living in poverty - 79 million - as at the start of this century .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has played an active role in monitoring the waste management situation in Campania , as demonstrated by the Committee on Petitions , for example , which was adopted following the visit of Campania last April .
Very often , such people show antipathy towards others , feel alienated and fear of society .
Like many others , I remain concerned about the transfer of data blocks and , in particular , about the control of these data when they go beyond our control .
- Report : Casaca
The way to make progress in this area is to increase their skills , for example , by channelling EU funds into policies for young people more effectively .
Frankly , it strikes me that we need to take up the defenceless position almost because we cannot go through this issue solely on the basis of the Euratom Regulation , because so that we can fully control the situation and determine its final outcome , we must also take account of consumer protection , the protection of the population in the event of a major disaster , as provided for by the European Treaty .
Lastly , European energy security is linked to close cooperation with NATO .
We think that the European Union and the European Commission must be much more insistent on values that enable us to implement a common project for peace and security .
In any case , she can count on my commitment .
The Framework Decision states that by November this year , all Member States should introduce penalties for racist and xenophobic crimes .
I would also like to urge Serbia to make a stronger commitment to employment policy and social cohesion .
Funding for land owners , which is to be seen in the developing countries in particular as an investment cost under the EIB &apos;s external borrowing mandate .
The European Union plays an important role in this respect , because it has not only the right , but also the duty , to insist on full compliance with high environmental protection standards , and I can imagine that similar dangerous reservoirs exist in other Member States .
Given that I was also the rapporteur for the only EU institution report on earthquakes , I know very well that a great deal can and must be done at European level .
I come to the Commission &apos;s composition .
Institution cooperation must be fair , logical and democratic .
I am sure that this was the right decision to wait until July , not to put forward and wait for the proposals that we are discussing .
Mr Mavrommatis mentioned a number of points that we have noted , but I think that 70 years is the best thing to bring life closer .
EU legislation stipulates that passengers are entitled to information and assistance from their airlines .
( LT ) The report on the amendment to the Council regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community is provided by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Although the wording of Articles 7 and 8 has been improved , I believe that more could have been done to ensure greater equality .
The EU must not lose sight of this , but must do much more to protect women and children and to ensure respect for the rule of law for every single person in Egypt and Libya .
I am pleased to say that the first steps have been taken in this regard .
Colleagues , there is a plenary session , so please stop the negotiations and let us keep the one-minute speeches .
However , this must not allow decisions to be taken that are in the hands of the euro Member States .
We insist on mandatory insurance for assisting spouses in the same way as for self-employed workers .
In addition , given that the government had lost access to the financial markets , the lack of support would have meant that even more restrictions on fiscal policy than was the case in this programme would have been necessary , and the reduction in expenditure would have been more serious .
As an example of this dogma , I presented the latest article by V√°clav Klaus which recommends to us how to overcome this financial crisis by temporarily reducing social , environmental and health standards , because he says that these standards hinder the rational behaviour of people .
In the context of the current discussions , it is important to draw up clear guidelines and to defend them , including on behalf of Austria .
One of the many equally effective , environmentally sound chemicals or , for example , the pyrolinical / terminal method of paint stripper will have to be used in private and professional activities .
This time , after a long debate , Ireland , a small country like Finland , sought protection in the European Union and it wants to help strengthen the EU .
From the point of view of budgetary control , which today also includes the actual results and functioning of the European programmes and institutions , the EIB certainly deserves its high level of assessment , particularly in terms of political credibility .
This is a difficult task , but I am sure that you will make every effort to achieve it .
I am not the only person who wants to know the answer to this question .
We have also , with deep concern , read the reports on the detention of several Tibetan students and teachers who took part in the peaceful protest against the plan for reform of the education reform of the government .
In view of the key varieties of this process , we will all have to show some flexibility .
However , it is important for additional factors to facilitate patient access to cross-border healthcare services in the future .
He , for his part , will have to accept the northern vice-president &apos;s soul , which opens a new political picture in Nigeria .
Another important aspect is the development of alternative sources of funding .
I was really pleased to work on this report and I hope that it will be followed by individual reports on every Western Balkan country .
I therefore support this resolution , which calls on the Commission to include bee diseases in the scope of European veterinary policy and draw up an action plan for tackling bee mortality .
However , the beneficiaries are the people who will receive a free gift .
What will remain when these five years have passed ?
I am sorry , but your speaking time is 30 seconds , and the question is about human rights in Cuba .
Regardless of the initial activities of President Yanukovych and the future statements by Ukrainian authorities on Ukraine &apos;s readiness to join the EU , to adopt a European model of good governance and to respect the human rights of its citizens and the freedoms of its citizens must , however , be respected .
Only through a single approach by the European Union can we address the growing scale of counterfeit products available to the public ; these products are available not only in the shelf , but also through distribution services , such as the Internet .
That is all .
Simplification of access to the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund are essential support for the Member States worst hit by the current economic crisis .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has many times adopted resolutions condemning violations of human rights and people &apos;s freedoms in various parts of the world .
As you know , the diplomatic dispute in the wider region of Gaza has been very significant : the indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been broken ; Mauritania and Katara have interrupted relations with Israel ; the withdrawal of the Arab peace initiative has been threatened .
Firstly , it is about a decision announced by the European Court of Human Rights , which is not an institution of the European Union , but rather a court - the concentration of the European Union - but it operates individually - that is linked to the rule of law , to representative democracy and to human rights .
We can help to promote the market for new technologies , such as clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and promote harmonised standards for the widespread introduction of new technologies on the market .
However , despite our refusal to reconcile ourselves with this philosophy and our attempts to prevent its implementation , the reality forces us to use force even in peace missions .
This situation poses serious problems for both carriers and EU companies .
Likewise , the danger faced by children in Israel is not acceptable .
The new President of the European Council , in his new role , will start working on 1 January 2010 and has expressed his ideas on how to organise the work of the European Council in the future .
We do not currently have the right of legislative initiative on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon , but the Commission promised us a reply on our prospects .
This instrument will benefit both the European Union and its partner countries in economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation .
Climate change , as I have said many times , is an urgent and serious issue and requires targeted and effective instruments .
The European Union must focus on more practical things , namely , building a dynamic and competitive economy , a stable world trade system and ensuring a genuinely effective climate change agreement in the coming weeks .
A peaceful , united Europe and the European Parliament probably felt at all that time fantasy .
There are , however , a number of unclear points in the resolution adopted , while others are not sufficiently developed .
However , I would like to convey to the next College of Commissioners , both the President and its members , that I and other Members of this House will resolve this problem , because we need to make sure that every product produced must comply with the highest EU standards .
The essence of the matter is , however , quite different : unless the political aspect of the European project is clarified , we will not be able to solve our problems .
I absolutely agree that the debate on territorial cohesion must be linked to the debate on the future of the EU &apos;s cohesion policy , given that it must include conclusions from the territorial cohesion debate .
If our Member States can no longer invest so much in education , training , research and innovation , then do so at European level by pooling our resources , thereby ensuring economies of scale .
I therefore call on colleagues to accept the oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution , which is to say not only regret the current situation , but also to encourage the Azerbaijan Government to withdraw its decision and to renew the FM radio licences for the broadcasters mentioned .
I would like to reiterate that the political commitment of the Euro Plus Pact is accompanied by all other measures in the package aimed at improving the economic performance of the Member States : a stronger Stability and Growth Pact for fiscal supervision , new macroeconomic surveillance and the crucial implementation of structural reforms of the EU 2020 strategy for economic growth .
I voted for this report because I believe that creating a safe and transparent environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties improves the quality of European democracy .
Alzheimer &apos;s is a futile disease which , despite intense research , has no effective medicine .
We believe that the review conference will only be successful if there is a balanced approach .
I fully supported the adoption of this report , which confirms the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area .
That is not our job , and I appeal to your honourable applause - the same as you always show - to remain honest about this .
Before the vote on paragraph 16 :
A similar situation is in the Bumbrella , in Austria .
If they organise themselves properly , they can change .
It is worth highlighting two of its aspects .
I supported this report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector for food security because it presents important proposals on how the common agricultural policy will be implemented after 2013 , it must respond to the challenges of food security , climate change , economic crises and the preservation of territorial balance in the EU .
Following the amendments to the Staff Regulations of the European Communities and to the amendment to the Financial Regulation , which aim to include the establishment of the European External Action Service in these documents , it is now necessary to approve a budget for its proper functioning .
( EL ) Mr President , the decision of the new President of the United States of America to close the prison in Guant√°namo was one of his first important and positive actions , and I warmly welcome that .
I personally introduced a review clause to improve it .
A whole series of such acts , including the cancer monuments and Slovene school , as well as the injury of Slovene seats containing colour , have deeply overshadowed the Slovene sweeps of the Slovaks living in Italian citizens and in the Republic .
For this to become the last obstacle to the plans of Germany and France to introduce tax standards in the European Union .
VAT is paid solely to subject C , which is prepared to sell products to the consumer .
Finally , the situation in the Darfur region is very precarious , but the government wants to hold a referendum on regional status unilaterally on 1 July 2011 .
Such a system takes far greater account of the variety of market differences and differences in the mentality of individual Member States .
Mrs Rapti , I gave you a little more time , because birth always takes longer .
If all of us here in Parliament want to take action to protect the democratic values of the European Union , then we must issue a serious warning and , Commissioner , we must implement European legislation , which you have already mentioned , and we must make it clear , in addition to the thousands of Italian intellectual and creative areas and journalists , that freedom must be respected and information provided in Italy and throughout the European Union , unconditional .
Thus , they have been able to either make any positive provision aimed at controlling the safety rules for ships or suspending it for an indefinite period , either , in this long , buried procedure .
The Swedish Presidency has dealt with the economic crisis and the financial turbulence through sensible and realistic measures .
Finally , I believe that it is essential to guarantee the right to return to the same workplace or to the same position .
The Commission has a position to follow on these issues .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group strongly and consistently supports the aim of receiving all the countries of the Western Balkans in the EU .
But we put all the emphasis on Member States and very little on who lies behind the market .
We will need to give leadership to the Environment Council in the area of external action by discussing and planning policies on climate change .
I hope that the Member States and , above all , Italy , will , in the near future , transpose this legislation .
If you want to take the floor under the &apos; catch-the-eye &apos; procedure , you will be able to do so at the end of the debate .
The data transferred can only be used in strict certain cases and must not be transferred to third countries .
The next item is the report by Mr Karim , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I therefore believe that the conclusions of the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation , which are recommending that the interests of the outermost regions be taken into account as well , should be supported by Parliament &apos;s agreement if the Commission and the Council provide Parliament with an impact assessment as soon as possible on the consequences of the agreement in developing countries and the outermost regions ; implementing specific measures aimed at strengthening the commercial situation of banana producers , and adapting programmes to the financing of ACP banana-producing countries .
The key factor in achieving this objective is the desire of developed countries to open up their markets to developing countries , which also includes India .
I am very grateful to Mr David and others , who have succeeded in drafting a package that received a majority in committee .
There must be one objective by 2020 : every young person needs work .
Various paths of development and growing inequalities in the distribution of opportunities and resources mean geographical , social and intergenerational spreads , rising climate change ( on which people are partly to blame ) , and the increase in the number of natural disasters linked to them , the increasing environmental pollution , the unbalanced anthropolden workload that focuses on large urban areas , and the uneven increase in the number of people &apos;s population &apos;s dignity in some areas , are leading to the increase in the level of humanitarian conditions .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their joint work , which has ensured the agreement of all the political groups in Parliament and made it possible for these groups to submit an oral question and prepare a resolution supplementing voluntary partnership agreements .
The European Economic Recovery Plan , presented by the Commission in November 2008 and approved by the Council , provides for the immediate response to the urgent issues and calls for investments that would benefit the European Union in the long term .
Quality jobs are very important , not only for the dignity of the people , but also for their opportunity to make a profit .
( IT ) Mr President , you mentioned the victims of the attacks in Russia .
We must condemn the atrocities committed by fanatics .
It is important to combat the black market economy at European level and to stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises .
In order to prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS , schools &apos; education programmes on sexual and reproductive rights are vital .
Ukraine needs to get to grips with the arms of both sides , however difficult it may seem at the moment .
It is particularly important to raise the level of patient awareness of medicinal products subject to medical prescription in order to prevent too much use of pharmaceutical products for commercial reasons .
Ukraine is a European country and recognises all European cultural values .
We therefore believe that the draft law of Lithuania fully violates the values enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The establishment of a common legal framework is absolutely necessary to promote and accelerate the development of these infrastructures .
The President replied that these were internal questions and that the European Union cannot interfere in internal affairs .
In this case , the European Union must take a stronger position .
The potential deficit of the fund is a problem for the fund and not for the European taxpayer .
The Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal because it is only Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia that , as we know , the bullfighting is not being conducted .
I will respond to Mrs Doyle &apos;s statement .
All this requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which we are lacking .
This is an optional measure in the Commission &apos;s proposal tabled 10 days ago : in other words , instead of creating a single market element , the Commission is eliminating it .
For these two reasons , I think we should be very careful about where the money comes from , not where it comes from .
First and foremost , we should welcome Vice-President Tajani &apos;s support for the new European tourism policy set out in the Treaty of Lisbon last June by adopting the communication and presenting us a plan for implementing it a few weeks ago .
I am also in favour of &apos; more &apos; budgetary assistance , both for general and for some sectors , and for a few projects as long as it is allowed by macro-economic and governance criteria .
I would like to end by emphasising that it was 200 years ago that C.v Darwin published its book entitled &apos; Suu origin &apos; .
I believe that , with the Swedish Presidency , we will succeed at the Copenhagen Summit .
However , it seems to me that the measures already in place for the electronic identification of sheep are relatively successful .
Mrs Lulling , I have just received information that the issue of ros√© wine is to be discussed in May .
( RO ) Madam President , as previous speakers have already mentioned , the European Union has obviously not made enough progress so far in ensuring the financial stability of its markets .
At least we will not be the last deadly button of this missile defence system .
I would like to begin with important information on the Sakharov Prize for 2009 .
The main aim of the Commission &apos;s competition policy is to enable the companies involved to benefit from the security area by adopting a block exemption regulation designed to guarantee proper supervision of the markets .
Madam President , this spring summit is about energy .
Citizens want to see the law applied equally for all .
I agree with the rapporteur that these improvements to the Euro-Mediterranean agreement can contribute to economic and political stability in this key region , with a view to consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report is related to the new Energy Action Plan for Europe 2020 .
And Mrs ≈¢icƒÉu &apos;s question ?
Europe must commit itself more strongly to the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , by 2015 at least 0.7 % of GDP should be allocated to combating poverty in developing countries .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports focus in particular on the partnership principle .
He is certainly in conflict , under the guise of the Copenhagen criteria , by citing other legislation , and at the same time - perhaps due to a lack of interest or perhaps due to a lack of courage - under the pretext of a lack of competence so that , if we can say so , there is a delay in progress in protecting minority groups , because we are ultimately faced with eternal dilemma .
Many of these irregularities have been identified and reported with delays , endangering the protection and proper use of taxpayers &apos; money .
The Swedish Presidency of the EU and the Commission must be congratulated for their work on the activation of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection .
I would like to call on the European Commission to take the necessary measures to strengthen supervision , which is an integral part of the European Union &apos;s consumer protection policy .
As a free Padania !
We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the draft budget of the European Union for 2011 .
Livestock farmers have nothing to do with final consumers because they are concluding transactions with processors , who can always choose to import meat .
Nobody is always completely satisfied , but I personally find the appointment of these two representatives to be a positive thing because a balance has been struck between different interests : between small and large countries , between men and women , and between different political opposing positions .
Mr President , today &apos;s terrorism is dominated by Islamist terrorism .
The lesson can and must be learned for all those involved in order to avoid such incidents in the future .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds can be sacred , but they can also be a curse .
This European Parliament resolution therefore focuses most closely on creating new jobs and combating social exclusion .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that one thing that we all agree with and that we have strengthened is that this programme for the harmonisation of frequencies and for the coordinated use of spectrum can serve two purposes .
The reason for this is that there are still wars in the world ; there are currently 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced persons , and it is clear that these refugees are the consequences of the war that our countries took part in launching .
Could I now ask you , Madam President , to write a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency , and also to the upcoming Swedish Presidency , to initiate an official dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible ?
Against this backdrop of reality , Europe must make itself heard by asking us to support the establishment of ODA companies ; by asking for new resources to help them to help them to reduce costs and taxes on migrant workers ; by demanding resistance to protectionist attempts and support the Doha Round ; and by demanding action against tax havens and tax evasion ; and by working to abolish debts for the poorest countries ; and also to achieve a temporary debt .
Some claim that the introduction of the claim will be costly , but many products already have that indication , so the additional costs must be limited .
There is no sign that the limitations that we include in the report will have any impact or limit the Member States in the area of passport .
I fully agree with the rapporteur .
I would like to thank the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality and Parliament as a whole for the work they have done to achieve this success .
Foreign operators do not pay any price to use our roads , while the UK diesel tax is 23 per litre higher , given that the competitor prefers 15 % .
Therefore , the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation to create an EU operational headquarters could be of great use to complement the existing NATO management bodies in the area of single civilian and military operations .

in writing . - The new rules approved today by the EP will give real support to consumer rights across Europe .
From the very beginning , the human rights movement positioned itself , above all , as a movement aimed at overcoming Stalinism in the public , political and cultural life of the country .

Yesterday , we met the Commission in Madrid .
If we did so , we would help to expand the decent work programme .
I and my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , are deeply concerned by the fact that this document is substantially weak and by the way it was drafted .

I voluntarily recommend replacing Mr Stavros in this very important debate .
One possible and very important source for the countries of Central and Baltic States would be to use emission credits that have accumulated under the Kyoto Emissions Trading Scheme , to benefit from these countries &apos; climate resources .
Thank you .
I supported the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and approach adopted in the Commission communication &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea of an annual Single Market forum .
However , like my fellow Members , I regret that the Council is questioning Parliament &apos;s new powers of codecision on long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
- Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that after four years , we still have not seen the Commission &apos;s proposal on how we could make animal transport legislation more stringent .
This report has come about as a result of the compromise , as no less than 1 625 have been tabled , and a number of key questions have been removed from the root causes of the crisis from property bubles to unaffordable banking products , the lack of harmonisation of European tax systems and the inability to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Despite a difficult situation , these measures will make it possible to maintain a permanent cash flow to guarantee beneficiaries of payments during programmes .
I believe that tax authorities in the Member States must work together to track tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , Minister of the Government of Pakistan , Salman Taseer , Governor of the province of Punjab , or Sabir Jamaldini , coordinator of the Commission on Human Rights of Pakistan , have become innocent victims of the fantastic use of Islamic law .
I would like to use the words , which reflect what is positive in the European Union , because , however strikingly it may seem , there are also positive things that have happened recently .
This is an important measure supporting families with children and enabling them to reduce the unfair tax burden they face .
Let us expect them with enthusiasm by giving up prejudices .

Municipal employment opportunities are very important for women , because they could be very useful in avoiding unemployment or better reconciling professional and family life .
in writing . - It is extremely important for the EU to act and become a world leader in reducing carbon emissions by opening negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also important to enable women to take part in the post-war reconstruction work .
This will enable candidates from all the IMF Member States to compete based on achievements and to take all relevant aspects into account .
Without that assistance , Ukraine would not be able to fully integrate itself into many areas of the economy in the future and achieve its future objectives .
To a large extent , the efforts of the European Parliament will result in the same rules for all funds sold in the European Union .
in writing . - ( HU ) In the space of a year and a half , the European Union has come almost completely out of divisions .
This should ensure that companies with certified products in one country do not have to travel to another .

Up against antibiotics ( debate )
Mrs Takkula &apos;s report deals with an important social problem .
in writing . - Many recent events have demonstrated the importance of consumer confidence , partly due to the right legislation for consumer protection on the market .

The Muslim Brotherhood is openly promoting this agenda and is backed up by 20 % of voters &apos; choice .
Of course , we have developed the EU 2020 strategy , which sets the planning objective for sustainability .

Ladies and gentlemen , I think what happened in the Committee of the Regions was a serious violation of the rights of an EU Member State .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am surprised by the discussion being held by my fellow Members who , on the one hand , talk about simplification for small and medium-sized enterprises , but who , when the time comes for milk to take the first step in the direction of micro-enterprises - and not just for these , not larger companies , we are talking about today - are prepared to say &apos; no &apos; once again .
I support the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage the waste and thus prevent its hazards , as well as more demanding the approval of regulators that prevent abuse .
We should aim for a complete transition to renewable energy by 2050 .
We need the full implementation of the existing rules , and I think your comments on navigation and other aspects of this debate are very useful .
elsewhere in this strategy regret the ageing of European society .
I think that , as Parliament , we have a duty to try and get more dynamic decisions in response to the challenges that arise in Europe , while bearing in mind that we must be transparent in our management of our funds .
Likewise , a situation in which MEPs , behind closed doors , must ask the Commission about the content of the agreements expected by our vote .
I would like to point out the positive interaction between public and individual actions , both by stimulating compensation for victims and by setting a five-year deadline for submitting complaints .
I agree with the rapporteur , who has welcomed positively the efforts to strengthen the management of financial and human resources and to improve the functionality and effectiveness of internal controls carried out in 2008 .

In a Europe on which we dream , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
( DE ) Mr President , serious problems have arisen in all countries that have been hit by the crisis .
We urge the Council not to make Parliament and itself a laughing stock .
That is why both my political group and my political group support this directive , because this is a concrete step on the part of Parliament , which will have a positive impact on the lives of European people .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on consumer rights presented by the Commission has been successfully combined in a single legal instrument four previous directives on this subject .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Mr S√°nchez Presedo from the Socialist Group and Mrs Bowles from the Liberal Group , who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text presented today on the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , it can be seen from the fact that none of them are in the Chamber for a long time , and they will not hear what Inese Vaidere has just said - that a real Russian visa policy was a weapon , nor to promote the naturalisation process in Latvia , but also to do so on the contrary .
However , I believe that the work we have done enables us to be optimistic .
I think that the EU should give due consideration to this opportunity in the future dialogue , in which the High Representative is the negotiator .
( DE ) Mr President , the debate reflects the outstanding issues of economic policy in Europe .
Furthermore , the Commission &apos;s strategy for controlling research has been designed to give sufficient confidence in the legitimacy and regularity of multiannual research expenditure throughout the entire framework programme .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
What we are seeing is an attempt to manipulate the European Union &apos;s trade policy - which , unfortunately , is currently linked to - in order to implement a secret socialist agenda that has been constantly rejected .
It is important that we make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
EU Member State citizens are broadcasting one of the most important sources of information and is therefore an important factor in establishing people &apos;s values and views .

( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , every year thousands of children are victims of child traffickers and even more are being kidnapped .
Good governance and EU regional policy (
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not , for example , mean environmental sustainability .
Such cooperation makes the rapporteur &apos;s lives much easier .
Therefore , from a political point of view , it is , of course , important that we vote in favour of this document , and this radical change - as is also part of this Chamber - is totally unjustifiable in view of the debate we have had .
Moreover , this position is confirmed in both the study proposed by the Commission and the Swiss Commonwealth Rights Institute and the Schaldemose report adopted by Parliament for 2009 .
( NL ) I should like to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his energetic and diligent efforts for the good of public health and patient mobility , and I should like to wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems of recent days in European aviation have demonstrated once again the crucial role played by passenger and freight transport in the life of modern society .
Secondly , and above all , we did so because you use the attention naturally paid to the victims in order to create a new , complementary impact on immigration : social and legal assistance , automatic residence permit , access to the labour market , simplified reunification and social protection for an accessible family .
Furthermore , the message to several governments has indicated that they are opposed to some policies , such as those aimed at reducing taxes .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package we are going to vote on tomorrow would have ended with no end to the will of the European Parliament , and I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the work carried out .

I believe that this is a matter for the G20 countries to decide on .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effectiveness of the functioning of European agencies in the areas of employment , working conditions and vocational education .
The aim of human rights has all too often led to a dead wall , enabling millions of lawyers to become rich in defence of the false rights of terrorists , criminals and deceived persons .

Let me take this opportunity , Madam President , honourable Members , and thank you for the additional EUR 10 million which was approved by Parliament to the European Refugee Fund at the end of 2008 .
Nowadays , patients are increasingly tending to seek health information so that they can play an active part in making decisions regarding their own health .
They are disappointed , and they are worried about the possibility that they may be excluded from the labour market .
If only we have paragraph 1 , everything is pointless - and paragraph 1 , in which we call for a strong and sustainable CAP to continue with a budget that is consistent with ambitious objectives , will also be pointless .
by Louis Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the report on the Single Market for consumers and citizens ,
The reference points for increasing employment must be genuinely chosen , especially in the area of youth employment .
I think what is good here : we are all interested in research and we all aware that this is the only hope for Europe and the Member States .
I would like to say that the fact that the Presidency clearly did not condemn the article in the Swedish newspaper was wrong .
Measures to prevent late payment in commercial transactions are needed in order to protect the European economy and avoid cases where production structures are being curtailed financially and too high a financial price imposed , thereby increasing dependency on banks .
It is absurd to encourage imports of products that do not even meet the quality criteria that our farmers have to meet .
Finally , there is a great deal of work ahead of us to ensure unity at European level in order to work strategically with the main external partners and maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate measures , but we can learn a great deal from COP 15 .
It must therefore be based on real problems , it must ask important questions and concentrate on specific measures that will increase the value of people &apos;s daily lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would very much like to thank the rapporteur once again for his very constructive attitude .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment , which to a certain extent protects bees bees , which is very important for farmers and for the supply of food due to pollination .
In this way , we can encourage users to choose between long-term cleaner vehicles or modes of transport in order to use less contaminated infrastructure or relocate at different times .
On security , we are concerned by Iran &apos;s attitude and by the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan .
I think that negotiations need to be initiated to ensure that the best solution to this issue is one where everyone takes on a common commitment .
We need to know which Member States have high standards , but where their level is low .
On the other hand , other countries - for reasons which supposedly reflect their narrow interests towards candidates - have decided to use the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and try to keep it back outside .
I am pleased that this text has been agreed to allow slots to be frozen in the summer season .
Accordingly , we need to analyse , for example , events in Detroit in order to try to prevent errors , but we cannot automatically respond after each attack , because that would probably lead to the adoption of measures that sometimes do not make sense .
At least a full period of time should be credited with pension contributions .
Any further abuse and unjustified political attacks will be superfluous .
In this sense , Europe &apos;s approach could be - yes , of course , we need external energy supplies , we need security of energy supply , we need major innovative projects , such as Desertec , but we also need to ensure that people , companies and companies , as well as individual households , have more power to determine their energy budget and energy consumption depending on energy prices , savings and the environment .
Therefore , the Spanish representatives of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will support the proposals calling for an impact assessment and vote in favour of the amendments proposed by Mr Sturdy - which I myself signed - concerning the disrupting substances of the endocrine system and those supporting the availability of plant protection products in the event of emergency .
It is shocking that countries that are working conscientiously are having to pay for another mistakes again and again .
Europe has been making a significant commitment to this region for some time : Afghanistan granted EUR 1 billion a year , to Pakistan - EUR 300 million , an EU police mission to underestimate , even though it was faced with staff problems , an international observation mission was there , and , of course , the commitment was made by certain countries and by the International Security Force .
That is one thing .
It is also necessary to ensure that India develops and introduces some transparent and clear rules in the public procurement system , which will make it easier for European companies to access these markets .
Thus , by carrying out a proper impact assessment and identifying various legal alternatives , while clearly defining the objectives and funding of the European infrastructure , it will make it easier to implement long-term strategic projects for creating a stronger European Union .
Part of this process is the ratification of the new ICTAR Treaty , which has still not been carried out by the US Congress .
They are becoming increasingly mobile and , in the recent past , the risk analysis has shown that organised crime is increasingly being carried out in cyberspace .
I also think - as has already been said - that we have made it clear on aspects that deserve criticism , namely group support .
I am determined to work in tandem with this President of the European Council , because this partnership will be crucial .
The positive thing is , however , that the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers for immigration purposes in consular authorities and international organisations responsible for preventing illegal immigration and encouraging the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
People were right to say then that the Brandenburg &apos;s gates had become the gateway to freedom .
Firstly , the communication sets out how good governance in the field of taxation can be improved in the European Union in order to reinforce the argument to follow other jurisdictions .
I mentioned at the beginning of the talk the radical choice , and the Commission knows where it wants to go .
However , it is clear that if the two largest parties do not make direct concessions in the country , this objective will never be achieved .
I think your contribution is all the more important because the current situation is forcing Member States to make difficult choices , and I believe that , for the future , it is essential to protect research and innovation , and I can assure you that I will keep the Council informed of the substance of this debate and always at my disposal .
We must be humiliating and recognise the highest rights of democracy and Parliament &apos;s power in the 27 Member States .
I also believe that we should continue to be intolerant in matters of human rights and democratisation and set extremely high standards .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation is a step forward in gradually achieving the CO2 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe .
We can see that this transport strategy is at the forefront of major European strategic events .
In particular , groups that are most at risk as a result of unethical practices , such as children , young people and the elderly .
Despite these reservations , I very much welcome the micro-credit services in Poland .
The Egyptian authorities must take urgent measures to end torture , investigate all cases of violence against peaceful protests and bring an end to the sentence of civilians before military courts .
In the case of years , there are different national systems alongside one country .
The solution is therefore more democracy , not more far-right politics , hatred for people and cynical contempt for people .
It is na√Øve to link hopes to a database comprising all its different languages and IT systems in the EU , provided that , in the UK alone , billions of pounds were wasted , the attempt to create a health care database failed .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication called the &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; in order to restore the single market .
Once again , for the sake of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must now create an effective and transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is available to all investors , including small ones ( such as SMEs ) .
This proposal on an EU tax is anonymous .
As has rightly been said , we need Plan B , and the railway system is the possible alternative .
I would like to express our thanks to the European Parliament for the additional EUR 3 million allocated in the EU budget for 2008 to restore cultural heritage to the areas affected by war in the Western Balkans .
Furthermore , Member States have a duty to ensure that no return operations are taken in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which requires Member States to guarantee that he will not be returned to her country if he is returned , then persecution or a serious attack can be carried out against him .
This will give you the opportunity to be more effective than if you had resigned and allowed the various funds to operate individually .
By adopting legislation at EU level , it is imperative to be aware of the particular protection of women and children against domestic violence .
I hope that when 26 elected assemblies decide , administrative officials will not stop the democratic process by prohibiting their signature .
Iceland &apos;s 2010 progress report
There are also significant differences in individual countries when compared to what sentences have been sentenced for violence against women .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
In my opinion , the most important thing is to improve information , and I believe that these reports will contribute to this .
The next item is the vote .
It is important for us to realise that we are in a transition period from an intergovernmental approach to a community approach , and I am pleased with the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs .
However , we must not forget that efforts are being made to ensure the welfare of the child first .
Instead of removing microenterprises completely from the fourth directive , it is necessary to make it clear that a less regulatory requirement needs to be laid down and intended for the revision of the fourth and seventh directives .
If armed conflicts reach such a degree when international institutions are already under threat , the situation is extremely serious .
This report contains important proposals : to improve the collection of information at local and regional level ; to recruit more nurses under the control of specialised infections ; to promote training for health workers ; to pay greater attention to hospital infections .
Ireland decided to hold a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative by the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , to call on the European Union to formally recognise the genocide carried out by the Nazis during World War II and their henchmen against the Roma people , as this initiative is a success in fighting to protect the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , this is not the first time that our fellow Member , Mr Cohn-Bendit , who called the President - Prime Minister - was a dictator of Hugo Chavez , has not respected democracy .
A Tobin tax is one model that could be used for the proposed financial transaction tax .
Ending poverty , discrimination and social exclusion continue to affect many Roma people throughout Europe , so it is high time that this situation changed .
It is the public &apos;s duty to ensure freedom of choice and not to discriminate against anyone &apos;s activities simply because it does not fit into the forms of activity contained in the formal labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in accounting and audit , I have never seen a situation where the auditor would show the auditor how to do his job .
It is good that Parliament is paying more serious attention to the implementation and transposition of the laws that we have adopted here .
I am talking about the abolition of taxes on textile products coming from Pakistan , which could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Lombardia and the rest of Europe .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
The radical changes in rural areas in Europe pose a challenge to population , jobs , services and the environment .
It is therefore important to strengthen and develop concrete and harmonious cooperation and , at the same time , adapt it to the new challenges in international relations .
From Copenhagen , I expect a balanced commitment , a short- and medium-term commitment , a verifiable commitment followed by fines if they are not respected .
The representatives of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) therefore voted against this proposal and want all the parties concerned to be able to bear all the disproportionate losses .
I will ask questions because , while I am pleased with the solidarity measures adopted on 11 February , I have serious doubts as to whether we Europeans are really managing the situation .
They will be told that Europe was split into old times ; there were huge waves , and people in the East were very poor , they did not have democracy and they lived through the evil system called Communism , which killed millions of people .
I would like to recall that the Polish Parliament approved the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year , but the ratification documents has not yet been signed by the President .
I agree with the evaluation of the Commission &apos;s proposal as set out , and I would like to make a few observations on the importance of such measures .
The next item is the joint debate on the following :
The main thing is that negotiations have started and that Parliament is ready to take part .
We believe that the accusations being made against these people are unfounded and I can assure you that the negotiations with the Iranian authorities will continue in every way possible , while these issues are resolved satisfactorily , namely until they are released .
National forces want to end the economic monopoly of multinational companies and to return to Europe to small and family businesses , with the help of which they reduce unemployment throughout the European Union .
in writing . - In accordance with the advice of the Committee on Civil Liberties , I voted against the draft decision .
There are the following challenges : firstly , moving towards a common migration policy ; secondly , a significant improvement in the organisation of legal migration ; thirdly , improving integration procedures ; thirdly , combating illegal or clandestine immigration ; fifth , further development of Frontex ; sixth , procedures , conventions and agreements with countries of origin and transit ; and , thirdly , progress towards a common asylum policy .
In view of the Irish &apos; yes &apos; , we know that the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force , we know this , because it was the last obstacle .
The priority is given to employment , because there is a risk that economic recovery will not decrease unemployment .
The European Union must set an example , both by strengthening the rules and by strengthening our sympathetic efforts .
Between 14 June and 14 October 2010 , 1336 workers were made redundant and 1498 more workers were made redundant before and after that period .
Our aim is to complete this dossier and to report on the outcome of the negotiations at the Council meeting in June .
in writing . - The financial crisis for 2008 made it clear that the European supervisory authorities must coordinate the regulation and supervision of the financial sector in the EU .
For example , we remember the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme , particularly those that involved the Israeli aviation sector , which produced groundless aircraft in the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009 , causing the deaths of several people .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for the efforts you have made as the Presidency to combat poverty .
I share the view that without a global agreement , all of us will have been in vain .
I would like to highlight one paragraph of the draft Commission declaration which is annexed to this proposal .
The substance and far-sighted impetus of these three reports , which characterises Professor Mario Monti &apos;s new Single Market strategy , and which manage to represent a targeted cohesion for the revival of the European Single Market through 50 measures that this Parliament has redeployed and emphasised or emphasised in 14 priorities .
The governments of Gulf are reacting differently - significant financial packages for reducing urgent and social needs , announcing the implementation of political reforms , transferring legislative powers to elected bodies or opening up a comprehensive transnational dialogue .
As regards Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument , the Strasbourg Court will not affect the EU &apos;s remit .
I would submit all these questions again in the negotiations on the reform of the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I share the admiration expressed during the debate on the courage of the Tunisian and Egyptian peoples in expressing their discontent and frustration under their regimes .
I therefore simply do not understand why we cannot accept this agenda from this point of view .
in writing . - ( DE ) The European Union has introduced legal and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
The comprehensive final document , which includes the proposed means of legal protection for consumers , is pathetic thanks to her request to negotiate .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to impose an obligation on the EU Member States to report annually to the Commission on the activities of export credit agencies relating to risk calculation and the identification of unforeseen positions , as compulsory for calculating social and environmental risks .
Mrs Ronzulli , please sit down and stop speaking .
This is an important fact that demonstrates Parliament &apos;s will and its ability to offer itself as candidates for the main role of the CFSP / CSDP , based on what I would call a dynamic interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I therefore broadly support this report , provided that Member States continue to perform their tasks in the management , definition and protection of wilderness areas .
Most of all , however , after many months of travel , I will take note of Parliament &apos;s desire to see the completion of this service to satisfy the needs of the voters that you represent and to serve them well .
The item is closed .
This and other issues could have been addressed at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must remain unconditionally preserved .
So you can see that this is quite similar to the two regions .
This debate is therefore important to remind you that this year , 2009 , the Commission has committed itself to submitting to Parliament a communication to evaluate a possible European threat to freedom of expression and pluralism of information and to draw attention to the importance of drafting a directive guaranteeing pluralism of information in relation to new technologies , particularly television .
Effective implementation of the revised directive and the elimination of the shortcomings noted in the process of transposing and applying the previous directives will complement the protection afforded to citizens of the European Union against discrimination .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report , as it underlines the importance of European political parties as irreplaceable actors in the EU &apos;s political life , making concrete proposals aimed at creating a safe and transparent regulatory environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties .
Therefore , if we want to achieve the objectives that are set out here every week , we need an ambitious budget , but that does not mean less money for the future .
Yanukovych won the elections and became President democratically , but only by a narrow majority .
We need strong economic governance at EU level when the effects of the recession and the sovereign debt crisis are felt .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur believes that all the conditions have been met to abolish border controls with Bulgaria and Romania , but the European Parliament wants to be informed of the additional measures to be taken at the Bulgarian , Greek and Turkish border , which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration .
I am pleased to say that the regulation on the rights of air passengers has demonstrated its importance in providing guarantees so that the financial consequences of the restrictions do not have to be felt most by passengers and are not left out in a difficult chaos .
Just as in 2004 , the Council Presidency will be invited to choose the main candidate from the group of the European Parliament to take up this important item , and then our Parliament will have to express its opinion on this choice on 15 July , which will determine one of the first key political actions in the new parliamentary term .
We must call on all political forces to put an end to this crisis , because otherwise Albania will remain isolated and its European perspective will be undermined .
I supported this resolution on the effectiveness and effectiveness of EU funding for decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also insist that we must demand freedom for all political and political prisoners in Cuba and elsewhere in the world , but I do not recommend action that has already proven to be unsuccessful with regard to the transition of Cuba to democracy and liberalism , such as the embargo and the blockade .
I would like the expression of the people of Sri Lanka , which I have heard many times - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - to finally be passed on to the past .
The public &apos;s idea is very sensitive and completely against unnecessary , painful practices .
Secondly , if we are serious about achieving the target of up to 95 % by 2050 , the roadmap provides for at least a 30 % reduction by 2020 .
In general , the sector , particularly in groups of investors , accepts such a need , but three years since MiFID , the participants have been unable to agree to create a European consolidated data system .
We must also give regulators the power to ensure that these rights are properly respected .
I would also like , like Mr Tajani , to express my sincere and sincere appreciation for the work carried out by Commissioner Barrot , which was very important , and also for the good will shown by the French Presidency .
This Parliament has experienced her deficiency , but the Swedish Presidency has certainly derived from this .
Europe must guarantee that we will be much more effective in terms of energy consumption .
It is intended to buy goods and services with the best commodity and quality .
We Swedish Social Democrats are nonetheless pleased that , ultimately , you partly listened to our demands and to include more material on the rights of women and children in this programme .
It is clear that different changes are taking place in the Member States .
The opposite has happened to what the organisations intended for .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that in this area , like many others , our institution has absolutely no decision-making powers over the dogmas with which we are being attacked .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to the proposed amendment to Article 136 , I see two major problems - one of them being an institutional , political problem .
It is therefore a step in the right direction .
However , I do not agree that the fight against HIV is linked to a sensitive issue such as abortion .
Mr President , honourable Members , as regards the 2007 report on the main aspects and basic points of the common foreign and security policy , I wanted to highlight a number of important issues from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the fact that no mention is made of anti-democratic decisions and citizens &apos; prosecution , such as the prohibition of communist parties and other organisations , as well as the detention of Communist parties and other fighters in the EU central part of the EU and in the Baltic Member States , reveals the nature of the report .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must put a stop to free trade policy , to free movement of capital , to promote food security and to recognise water and energy as good commodities and to combat socio-economic inequalities .
firstly , that the whole state must guarantee the future of the Community even after 2013 ;
I have a question here as to whether we are talking about existing projects , which are already financed from the cohesion fund or new projects .
We must therefore say that we must stand shoulder to shoulder , following the speech by President Mubarak today , who is following the extinction of the regime and the release of the road to violence .
Today , I would like to thank the Presidents , Mr Borrell , and Mr P√∂ttering and Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions , for supporting the campaign for justice in Michael Shields .
I therefore voted against this report .
By adopting this binding target , I believe that the EU and Portugal will have more benefits than damage .
In order to earn as much as a man on average earns a calendar per year , women on average have to work by February next year , 418 days .
For ten years , they have been systematically discriminated against , at risk of assimilation and destruction , so their identity is in danger .
This report is on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I could also thank the Commissioner for coming here this evening to explain , in addition , the mandate that she wants .
It ignored the central issue of the reorganisation of the international monetary system .
The human rights issue must be central to her .
As a result , they would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the EU &apos;s common visa policy is facing a major challenge due to Canada &apos;s visa requirement for Czech citizens in the last 10 months .
EMA plays an essential role as a recognised source of objective information .
I have received a proposal to change today &apos;s voting order : after yesterday &apos;s meeting between President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero , it was decided to open a dialogue at the highest institutional level on certain procedural issues relating to the discharge of the Council .
Subject : Rail highways for Alpos
If we had a ancient Roman Senate , Senator would stand up and say to Mr Trichet : &apos; Quousque tandem dem Trichet , Trichet , patite , pathogen ? &apos; - how long will you check our patience , Mr Trichet ?
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow me , in order to address any suspicion that may exist , I would like to suggest that a European Parliament committee of inquiry into this matter be set up .
The concessions for services were deliberately excluded from the scope of the directive on public services in order to provide more flexible opportunities in these areas and to take into account cultural differences .
I agree with some of the other ideas that have been expressed , but I think it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is confined and understandable .
I believe that this network could be very useful , but at the moment it is not working effectively and does not fully exploit its potential .
It is , of course , true that the EPAs differed from the Lomes and Cotonou conventions , which represented EU-ACP relations for 30 years , but the one-sided advantages that characterised these conventions were compromised by other developing countries at the World Trade Organisation .
However , while we fully support the integration of the Roma people into the European Union , we have grave concerns about the intervention of the European Union on issues that we consider to be a responsibility of individual states , as is the case with access to health care , education and housing .
It is also important to give priority to food security , agriculture , infrastructure , capacity building and , in particular , to economic growth and access to technologies , and to the development and social development of the people of the least developed countries .
We cannot go on like this .
The initial aim is better implementation of EU legislation and hence healthier animals and a more decent living for the animals concerned .
What measures will you take to encourage wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis ?
We also need better practice because Slovenia , for example , follows these vehicles on its territory .
It is also important that these solutions will not only benefit our citizens today and tomorrow , but will also determine the future of our children .
If we want to prevent the prohibition of fishing , we must keep the level of 30 % .
We must address urgent priorities in this regard .
The cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing the differences in productivity caused by the crisis , but also to increasing productivity .
This is a very important issue for all EU citizens , and the way in which the Commission and Parliament will deal with this will say a great deal about responsibility and transparency .
To sum up all these circumstances , I would like to stress that all the non-standard measures that we have taken during the financial crisis are temporary measures and were designed in such a way that they can be lifted .
This report is worrying with regard to the actions of this Parliament that it shows .
organisation of strict projects , resource efficiency and clarity with regard to their duration ;
At the moment , they cannot , and so , as you have said , they are at risk .
I would also like to say straight away that I support Turkey &apos;s efforts and efforts towards democracy .
This Commission proposal extends the concept of micro-enterprises to defining them as companies which , on the balance sheet date , do not go beyond the following limit criteria : a balance sheet of EUR 500 000 , a net turnover of EUR 1 000 and / or an average worker review within a year of 10 .
However , we must meet our commitments on climate change : everyone recognises that we have a leading role to play in this issue in the world .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I was surprised by the fact that I did not see any changes to the timetable today , but I am very grateful for the opportunity to address Parliament on a very important issue in the area of financial services , that is , on insurance and overcrowding , on what we have done with regard to the report on the Solvency II Directive , and what I think we have finally managed to present to the whole of the European Union with a very concrete framework for regulation .
It is therefore absolutely necessary to move 30 % , and I would like to conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we can give future jobs to our competitors or we can take the opportunity of a century that they have already begun to do .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to make four comments .
In order to address this , I have invited , together with some other Members , to come forward tomorrow and to take the floor experts who have examined the trafficking of organs and the deliberate killing of human beings in China with the aim of obtaining organ transplants .
President-in-Office of the Council , we would like to thank you for your most constructive , wide-ranging report and wish you all the best for your Presidency .
These initiatives , promoted by EC funds , enable us to work together on specific projects and programmes , bringing together the strengths of each institution and , for example , offer a great test of how to build on the development of our joint work .
- ( SK ) We must once again look at the problem of respect for the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia , and that is the fault of the Minister for Education , the extreme national party .
Given the necessary protective measures , such as the possibility for European citizens to submit an administrative requirement and receive the same treatment as the US citizens , as well as shortening information retention periods , cooperation between Europe and the United States is , in this case , an appropriate cost for the negative consequences of globalisation .
The EIB can and must play an important role in resolving recent events in the Mediterranean .
I therefore support the call for an investigation to be carried out into the profitability of part of the production and distribution chain .
However , if you always put the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle first - I am prepared to discuss this with you - then it is the Member States that are responsible for congestion without providing sufficient infrastructure .
The first way to go is through student mobility credits .
However , it is important that we realise that , although these problems concern southern Europe in particular , we have the opportunity to strengthen the sense and commitment of citizens to society , what is known as the added value of the return link in the European context .
Today , Europe is losing its energy , despite the fact that it has a percentage of educated people higher than in the most successful countries , such as China or India .
We therefore need a more common and better Europe - a more unified and ambitious Europe .
I am sure that this is a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party opposed and voted against the amendments to adapt the European Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following comment : the most surprising fact that , at a time when Albania &apos;s growth rates are steadily on the rise in 2010 , growth in the mid-term period of the world economy is expected to reach 6 % and that the 3 % , social tension is still not diminishing , but is exacerbating .
Human trafficking remains a serious problem in the European Union , too .
There are other issues that I would also like to highlight by repeating what Mr Papov said .
The EU must make a serious contribution to the stability , development and capacities of Southern Sudan .
As already mentioned , Amendment 13 to the Sri Lankan constitution , which guarantees decentralisation through regional government by the people who live there , must be introduced , and in this area the EU can provide valuable assistance .
Of course , let me repeat , there can be differences of opinion , and there are differences of opinion between the Commission and the Council , and also among some in this House , with regard to the regulation on shipping by sea ; there are those who would prefer certain laws on river and maritime transport .
I support the justification for this proposal , namely the need to establish a consistent and comprehensive framework for development of investment systems in energy infrastructure in the Union , which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of planned investment projects in the energy sector .
The start was encouraging : in 1995 , an agreement was reached across the world under which women and men were equal in all aspects , including political , economic , legal and social .
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are correctly implemented in the country and make sure that the level of corruption in Serbia is reduced and that those state officials who abuse their position are severely punished .
To sum up , a Europe that we are fighting for - a Europe of justice and social progress , an economic and social cohesion that supports cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights and promotes peace - has little hope of achieving the guidelines that this Commission proposes .
It is important from both a democratic and a legal point of view that EU citizens be aware of what the EU is doing .
We Germans would not really appreciate our national unity if , following the historic events I have just described , this were not to be considered a contribution to European unity either .
Quite simply , we have the same person to fulfil the obligation of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero .
As I have already said in this House , I am anxious to see a Europe of nations working together .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained from voting .
Furthermore , the register &apos;s request for mandatory registration by all lobbyists seeking permanent entry authorisation by Parliament and the Commission is an important step in increasing transparency between these organisations and European institutions .
However , if we adopt everything at first reading , then Parliament will be preventing itself from enforcing its rights .
This is a very important step , which opens up the opportunity to implement more effectively the fundamental rights of European Union citizens .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the vote on Mr Kirilov &apos;s report will take place in the next few weeks , and I welcome it , because it is a matter of urgency .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation , because most vans are buying companies - large and small ones - that are already very well aware of the need to economise and make efficient use of fuel .
I propose that we carry out a study on consolidated accounts .
( DE ) Madam President , I have one general comment , and I would also like to ask two or three questions depending on the time allotted to me .
We must also remember that , with Turkey , countries such as Iraq , Iran and Syria will be at our borders in the European Union .
I think we should ultimately realise that we cannot talk about economic policy without constantly bearing in mind the employment parameters .
What would we expect from the EU ?
We must not forget that we are responsible for each of our actions to our constituents , who are going through difficult times .
For the same reason , however , export credit agencies can also , in a way , impede trade if their financial operations are not regulated by common rules .
I believe that good governance of the Single Market can only be guaranteed based on high quality and up-to-date information on the functioning of the Single Market .
in writing . - ( ET ) In the current era of global economic crisis ( namely the economic recession and rising unemployment ) , more and more people will be made redundant on the EU labour market , which will increase the number of people suffering from poverty and exclusion in Europe even more .
Of course , they already had a flag and anthem , but they started building a new state .
These are , to a certain extent , included in the social responsibility of companies , but they cannot be implemented without the public .
This is a time for compromise .
Furthermore , in the event of an accident , proper operational assistance must be provided for passengers with the most necessary services and equipment .
The Council adopts this joint document , which is why the President of the European Parliament can state that the budget has finally been approved .
We must support the establishment of private finance mechanisms and facilitate the adoption of public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
Moreover , our aim is also to stop misleading advertising on the Internet , which encourages people to buy medicines that not only cure them , but also harm the patient .
Mr President , I would like to submit an oral amendment to this amendment deleting two parts of the amendment , namely the Colombia army and Colombia .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and take initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe .
Madam President , I think this is one of the reports that many people would support .
Once again , we must draw attention to the excessive delays between the occurrence of the disaster , the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the actual delivery of European Union aid to the Member States and the regions affected .
We must have legal evidence , and that is why we have asked the French Government to send us personal cases .
Europe cannot be a collection of only 27 national interests .
At the moment , Mr Reinfeldt is presenting a report on the work of the European Council over the last six months .
The negative side of the savings measures , which will free those working people from jobs in the public sector , must be turned into a positive development for new businesses , with the spirit of enterprise setting up businesses , so that they can generate profits for the private sector , which must lead all our countries to the ruins that we are now experiencing .
Both directions have failed to achieve a common vision and , as a result , progress has stopped .
Will this free trade agreement ultimately only be suitable for the world and for the division of economic power between Europe and India , as we know now , or will this agreement be appropriate for a decade or fifteen years ?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy are broadband access throughout the entire European Union from 2013 and high-speed Internet connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis , but is primarily due to the lack of immediate action needed when the crisis began in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and the poor in Europe must mobilise forces against this catastrophic policy and fight for a truly democratic and socialist Europe , which means opposing this policy of this new EU Commission .
The European Parliament defends the prerogatives laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of this European Parliament adjourned .
Animal welfare requirements are now formally included in the European Union Treaty and must be taken into account when developing sectoral policies , such as the internal market .
It is mainly at the level of regions and their cultural heritage , and it is an asset that will be taken into account and highlighted by regional development policy .
I believe that we should focus all our efforts on creating this instrument .
You will need all the capacity of persuasion to give a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU .
This reserve is a accounting method that should be used for all the urgent emergency expenditure that could arise during this financial year .
Let us take a minute to honour the memory of our Tunisian friends .
Many mistakes and one of the defendants promise : the euro .
Given the initiative I have just described , I believe that there is now a solid basis on which we can improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research in the framework programme .
This debate is taking place on a lot of technocratic .
I therefore congratulate Mr Mill√°n Mon on this excellent report , which is submitted right at the right time so that relations between the two continents can be strengthened .
We have therefore proposed a significant simplification of EU law .
Unfortunately , important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected , and therefore initiatives should not lead to the signature of permanent citizens of the EU who are not nationals of a Member State , thus excluding the equal participation of the permanent population , irrespective of nationality , or to the fact that signatures will be held accountable to the codes of signatories .
I call for the establishment of an independent commission of local and international legal experts to investigate what happened and bring to justice the perpetrators of the violent act that followed the questionable presidential elections in December 2007 .
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West depend , to a large extent , on the results achieved in Afghanistan .
All this has come too far and must be stopped .
The preparation of guidelines for public and private sector operators and the creation of a training and mobility scheme to learn how to put into practice a multi-level governance policy could be effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope that our colleagues from Spain and Italy will join it , but we cannot wait any longer because the whole world wants an innovation market .
Furthermore , I think that it is our duty to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies starting with the future reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) adequately meet these requirements .
Mr President , the negotiations currently under way on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
Without diminishing the importance of adopting some of the important measures proposed in this report , I would like to draw attention here to an important element of this problem .
However , this method will not impose economic and employment bureaucracy , unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations .
This will not have a negative impact on cod stocks , because at the moment , the catch of cod is very limited .
The percentage of penalties proposed is proportionate and necessary , and hopefully will reduce the unacceptable business practices being spread among entrepreneurs .
In my opinion , this criterion is unjustified and discriminatory , given that the majority of these families live in shelters in rural areas , as is the case in Portugal .
This is an indicator of poverty in absolute and purely financial terms , without taking account of the diversity of the 27 Member States ; the only justification in general is simple solvency .
Consequently , both Official Development Assistance and new funding will be necessary .
The result of the ethical audit of this project &apos;s work was positive , and the project was certified .
In my opinion , the proposed level of 75 % cofinancing is too high .
I would like to clarify two things , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you to the Commissioner for drawing attention to the problems in Tunisia .
More than anything , the rapporteur regrets that citizens do not know about the rights that it would give them .
Whilst it is important to us that the European Union become an area of security , justice and freedom , and of course we are setting up a European model of democracy , and while many of us believe that Europol is a suitable instrument , we attach great importance to the creation of resources - primarily to the fight against organised crime and human trafficking - to the strict monitoring of our right to legal certainty and to European citizens &apos; rights , based on the rule of law .
It is therefore essential to introduce all those measures that could strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent , as this will help to increase the importance of this document , both in support of the decision-making process and in ensuring the quality and adequacy of the EU institutions .
The second remark is that the strategy should strengthen the internal cohesion of the EU , in other words , convergence .
I might add that this is not the direction in which the Commission left , because its proposal concentrated - with the regulation adopted by this Parliament - on the current system of agencies , in which agencies are private , reform and on the very stringent consolidation of transparency requirements in order to avoid interests , on fairness in the work of determining credit rating .
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
Even before the crisis that we are now facing , the Member States and the European Union had to address the social problems caused by weak economic growth , difficult demographic situation and the growing global economy .
However , there are aspects that cause for concern that the image of wheelchairs may be diminished .
We in Parliament have always held a firm position in defence of the rights of the Tibetan autonomy , which at the same time does not mean the right to self-determination or independence .
Although the directive will soon see the light of day , I voted , along with other Members , for a resolution setting out the direction to be taken by Parliament on this matter .
In view of this , it is important to introduce a system of monitoring and verifying medicines that will provide reliable information for patients .
It is worth fighting for this , and that is what I intend to do .
These costs will still be subject to some exceptions , provided that the Member State requesting them has good reasons to do so .
This framework decision must not lead to excessive red tape where the problems are prepared and more suitable solutions .
The Bank did not see a great crisis coming , and it was not brilliant to impose regulations that are far from ideal .
However , the European Union , as a serious organisation , must be better prepared for such situations and , in particular , should be prepared to respond effectively to emergencies .
- Report : Kaczmak
We should therefore support its inclusion only on condition that these measures are not in place .
I committed myself to informing the European institutions of this public protest .
The EU and other industrialised countries should set a medium-term target of a 25 % - 40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 , as well as a long-term target of at least 80 % by 2050 compared with 1990 .
- Report : Maria do C√©u Patr√£o Neves
I will be more specific about two unanswered questions that were repeatedly asked during this debate .
Firstly , on behalf of the Council , I would like to thank and congratulate the European Parliament for its cooperation and for the spirit of compromise , which has allowed us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers , especially disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons for this is our fragmented market in defence equipment .
At the beginning of this period , too , the question of energy efficiency and promoting renewable energies was important .
The establishment of the EEAS will require the adoption of various decisions , including possible changes both to the Financial Regulation and to the Staff Regulations , which require the Commission &apos;s proposal and decision making on the basis of codecision .
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to ensure a proper balance between resources .
in writing . - The whole situation in North Africa is indeed hazardous , but at the same time , it is encouraging .
Conciliation must be constantly improved , and the responsibility of the Member States must definitely be increased in this area .
With our convincing vote , the Irish people are giving us determination and strength to continue to promote and build a strong and , most importantly , federal Europe .
Although environmental protection and the protection of public health go hand in hand , I think that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers .
It is a shining bow that we need to tackle together .
We must work with the most important countries , such as the US , China , Russia and Japan , to address this problem and establish a global alarm system and a register on illegal logging and risk countries through the Interpol , an appropriate UN institution using the most recent satellite systems .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support to undermine its long-term competitiveness .
I would like to note that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
In the current context of the consequences of the economic and social crisis , the public in Europe and the European institutions have paid particular attention to the fight against unemployment and social exclusion .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to stress that I think this issue is too important for us to continue to live in meals in Europe .
As has already been said , of course , the names of the candidates were unknown , and all the candidates were men , although it has to be acknowledged that Commissioner Barnier has made this clear .
We are adept at the interest of abstention in the European elections and the &apos; no &apos; vote in referendums .
It will be necessary to find out what is happening and we will inform you of this , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , the horizontal agreements contain a very wide range of different provisions , and the inclusion of monitoring requirements in regulatory regulations directly or indirectly may lead to a reduction in competition .
We also need a more effective and more protective common European asylum system .
That concludes Question Time .
I am also aware that you want to contribute towards police cooperation that respects human rights and respects the values of the European Union .
In Pablo Pacso , such horrors were portrayed by Gernika in his glass , which saw our town of Gernika , destroyed by soldiers of Condorra &apos;s leregional nature eight decades ago .
In view of this , speculators , too , are attempting to speculate using a bad economic situation and are therefore sometimes making it even worse .
Mr Bov√© is absolutely right , and Mr Fajmon has a fundamental ...
We must promote not only competition , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution , ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe .
Mr Rapkay &apos;s report on the amendment of the Staff Regulations relating to the establishment of the European External Action Service is a very important document for the European Union &apos;s foreign policy .
We therefore believe , and let us repeat this at first reading , that the original expenditure plan reflects this one of our priorities and that we agree with the rapporteur that emphasis should be placed on multilingualism and property issues , which we have always considered to be a priority , but now this emphasis must be placed more on legislation .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of chairing a delegation from the Committee on International Trade of this Parliament attending the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva .
With this in mind , Europe will be able to move forward with a high head .
I called on the Member States to name names of the person , including women .
Firstly , it is essential to maintain the geographical distribution of financial support from the EU budget for the Mediterranean countries and Eastern European countries , in accordance with the financial framework for 2007-2013 , and to continue to support these countries in the form of lending by the European Investment Bank .
We believe that the case of Kosovo is an exception , and we would point out that Kosovo &apos;s independence has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States .
This is a reason enough not to call for Lukashenko &apos;s EU summit to be called upon to respond to the request of the Belarusian opposition .
It is very important to emphasise the human and holistic aspects of our policy , even if it concerns the internal market .
Mr President , I agree with what my fellow Members have said about the rights of travellers with disabilities , about children , by Mrs Kadenbach , the question of spraying fire fighting systems in all EU hotels , and that the new proposal should also be valid in the future .
I , too , wanted to ask a question about the gender balance in the Commission , so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment .
The report makes it clear that only the Member States have the power to defend and national security , which we think is important to emphasise .
Similarly , Member States that were most concerned about the sale of companies and the hidden takeover were those that did not have the obligation to provide information on the achievement of a certain share of the boundaries and about the price difference between them .
I would also like to thank my colleague , Mr Lehne , for his approach .
In other words , the text of the Copenhagen Agreement sets out the objectives required to tackle climate change in the post-2012 climate agreement and lays the foundations for the financial package and calls for a serious commitment to reduce emissions .
AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis continue to cost approximately four million lives every year .
As far as trade is concerned , I would like the Commissioner to guarantee that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) will not be able to use to prevent the trade in medicines available at more competitive prices , nor do the safe , unpatenting drugs , which can only be considered a breach of copyright and the only legitimacy that can be felt in developing countries , such as Brazil , for example , in the pharmaceutical industry .
However , it is a Member &apos;s right to speak .
This is unacceptable .
We want to be involved in this .
We must therefore clarify the correct amount of financial and technological compensation .
Here , too , we can take stronger action to protect competition and consumers .
Similarly , it is a shame that these politicians are forcing us to recognise the outcome of the second referendum when they did not actually admit the first result ourselves .
As co-author of the draft European Parliament resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I would like to thank my fellow Members who voted in favour of this document today .
Mr President , Minister , I will conclude with a recommendation to future generations .
It is absolutely essential to introduce clear rules and targets for managing waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) in order to strengthen the internal market in a sustainable manner and improve environmental quality in the European Union and to recover important strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government also emphasised that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union and that we will also call on our neighbours to carry out these stress tests .
The division between the powers of the military and the humanitarian actors must remain clear and a dialogue is needed between the military and humanitarian actors in order to promote mutual understanding .
The Commission continues to work on a much more systematic assessment of the quality of the development of public finances , including the drafting of a discharge budget .
That will be my priority as Commissioner for Trade .
The Commission was therefore able to submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation .
The US still needs to introduce clear , transparent criteria for abolishing visas in individual Member States .
The question of funding is closed .
For others in this Chamber of parliament , there is a need for constructive criticism of Turkey , we are ourselves critical friends .
Studies show that the profits derived from human trafficking go beyond the profits made in drug trafficking and the distribution .
Farmers in my part of the world feel fully and utterly accused of hearing some assumptions here that they do not know what they do and have to tell them that .
No .
For this reason , I voted in favour of this resolution , which stresses the strategic importance of a balanced tariff protection when considering the negative impact of market liberalisation on the local economy .
Overall , I voted in favour of the proposals put forward in this report for the recovery of the European economy by granting greater financial support to projects in the field of energy .
The report on the European Refugee Fund , which calls for refugees to be resettled to the EU , therefore seems even more incomprehensible .
This calculation may increase .
The economies use mathematical models to highlight the value of domestic work .
Only once we are fully aware of such cases will we be able to talk about a consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
I repeat : absolutely is not enough .
Particularly in the run-up to Copenhagen , the EU and other international community must also state their policy on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development as a matter of urgency .
I would like to refer to Commissioner Rehn &apos;s statement , which I have personally respected , which said that Nigeria is a very poor country : it is not true : Nigeria is a very rich country , but it is suffering a corrupt and miserable ruling class that has deprived the country &apos;s resources of millions of people in poverty .
Finally , Mr M√∂lzer , I would like to tell you that you will not be so pessimistic .
I therefore call on the Council to immediately declare its position on Parliament &apos;s new proposal so that the ACP countries can take advantage of the good measures announced for 2010 , and I ask the Commission to ensure that both producers and exporters outside the ACP comply with social and environmental requirements with one another .
This event forces the Commission , as coordinator of the Energy Community , to catch Ukraine behind its arms and to remind it of its obligations when it comes to European energy security .
in writing . - We regret , of course , all the victims of aggressive and authoritarian regimes , regardless of the atrocities that have been committed in Europe or , for example , in the former colonies of Europe .
The main aim of the regulation should be to implement a new culture of common control and responsibility rather than to introduce bureaucratic and costly processes for checking each product .
Member of the Commission . - The current EU competition policy for vertical agreements is very much in favour of Internet sales , and I am sure that you are aware of this , Mr President .
However , the report contains clear recommendations regarding the second and third error , and they all point in the right direction .
As far as transport is concerned , greater effort must be made to ensure that vehicle manufacturers use smarter vehicles in fuel terms .
The financial situation in some euro area countries , which were examined today , clearly shows the risk of moving away from the agreements contained in the Stability and Growth Pact .
I therefore think that it would be very useful to consider how we could use the financial resources saved in the best way to broaden the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and , apparently , necessary financial instrument that only serves to promote energy efficiency and renewable resources initiatives .
The Commission , and we here in Parliament , have chosen not to raise the whole issue of the processing of funds with caution , because we are working on the basis of the assumption that the industry will make a promise to resolve this matter by its own forces , namely through no legislative pressure .
I come to both questions about the EU 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as the production sector is concerned , I should like to remind this House that Pakistan is the world &apos;s fourth largest cotton producer , accounting for 9 % of total production , and the European Union is only behind it , with a little less than 5.5 % .
In this case , the Council and , first of all , Parliament are also involved in deciding on the creation of the college and the available posts , as well as on the programme for the next five years that you will set out .
We must realise that the process began only a year ago and that we should speed up it in 2009 .
Of course , this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people , as the country is already facing recession , the living conditions of workers and the people are deteriorating , inequalities are increasing , as is poverty .
These objectives , President of the Commission and President of the Council , have already been formulated in the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
We have already had work with many Arab countries to take the initiative to obtain gas , hopefully through Turkey &apos;s Nabucco gas pipeline .
Therefore , action to eradicate it in full is the objective of health policy that the Member State governments can best promote through flexible application of this measure .
As this is my last speech in this House , I would like to thank all colleagues and staff for their cooperation .
I am aware that there are currently significant differences between electoral rules in different Member States .
Many doctors of primary care too late start treating these sick people with anti-dementia medicines in order to go beyond their budgets , and this only serves to exacerbate the situation of these sufferers .
In a paradoxical way , this instrument can easily be used not only by extremists but also by powerful and influential interest groups , and I say this because we believe that the threshold of 1 000 supporters is insufficient in the light of the European Union &apos;s demographic potential .
The 2010 budget provides for such a systematic approach .
According to the UN task force &apos;s report , victims of trafficking in human beings come from different social layers , from Turkely to the poorest , from highly educated to full reading and writing incomprehensible , from young people to older women .
President-in-Office of the Council . - This is indeed a very important question .
We need more and better European economic governance for the measures taken by countries to support this position , including a tax on financial transactions , and I urge the Commission to look very carefully at that , even in a European context .
I believe that the recognition of prescriptions among Member States is very important , as it concerns not only healthcare , it concerns non-hospital care , but we also have a period in which such details can be developed to the full .
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade ( INTA ) for these reports , which raise important issues relating to the contribution of the European Union &apos;s trade policy to the achievement of some basic objectives of public policy : respect for human rights , economic prosperity and social justice , sustainable development and respect for environmental protection , particularly the climate system .
Consumers will have a number of opportunities to act if they purchase a goods that do not conform to the Treaty , and they will be able to claim damages if the inadequacy is not eliminated .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , the reason for this hasty is the brutal massacre of 57 people who went behind a politician who , in the light of the forthcoming elections , went to register Mr Mangudadatu &apos;s candidature for office as Governor of the province .
This new intelligent , symmetric framework will ensure stricter supervision , a more complete assessment of the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank , and the drafting of recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans .
Men deserve the long-awaited political reforms , especially with regard to freedom of expression and assembly , political ownership and governance .
Many of them were British citizens , not imported as a foreign service , if I may use that expression .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the third quarter of 2009 , growth again appeared in the European Union , which meant that the worst is behind us .
For this reason , Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration , accelerating pension and healthcare reform , improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the system of wage setting and improving the functioning and business environment , and preserving the stability of the banking and financial sector .
We believe that when establishing agreements between sovereign states , it is necessary , in any case , to take into account aspects such as the sovereignty of the country concerned and its people , the principles of mutual interest , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account the specific characteristics of each country ; to evaluate what each of them can bring to this agreement from an economic , social and cultural perspective .
In my opinion , the transition to a sustainable , green economy will also be made without over-regulatory measures being introduced .
Everyone seems to forget the US and , of course , NATO &apos;s contribution in promoting peace in Europe .
I think we should consider this as a suitable opportunity to address the vitally important issues for Europe : economic growth , jobs , a dynamic small business sector , more innovation , more efficient public procurement - these are things on which our citizens will look .
I believe that it is not our job to anticipate possible developments in these countries .
The second project concerns concessions .
Madam President , during the 2004 European elections in Ireland , a ban on smoking was introduced in the workplace , so we had to face many damaging voters outside restaurants and public places .
In fact , at a time of deep regret at the time of the EU budget , the increase is evidence of faith in the joint project and the promotion of national action .
I know that we have a good message , so let us go and distribute it .
This report includes guidelines for analysing air agreements in terms of content and acceptable procedures .
This language law has disrupted the balance .
It is possible that with 1 December , when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , this Parliament will also have completed the debate on British domestic policy .
This is the difference between the reality of the situation and the European Parliament &apos;s Academy .
Furthermore , we also support the full involvement of all national parliaments in accordance with their budgetary and control rights in order to increase transparency , coresponsibility and responsibility for the decisions taken , including at European level .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , five and two questions have been raised regarding economic governance and the EU 2020 strategy .
I therefore believe that in promoting SOLVIT , we must actively involve the national authorities , the European Commission and Members of this Parliament .
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines , and now , Mr Michel , a bit about heroes and the liberal rhetoric that we find ourselves in this situation , as well as about the fact that they have contributed to the depletion of the agricultural model , the protection of the interests of food producers , the agri-old , the indirect financing of this sector , and the fact that they have been dismantled by small and medium-sized enterprises , which have been dismantled to the global agricultural sector .
Economically speaking , the amounts paid to producers are below their production costs , and the CAP must provide a solution to this problem .
Once again , I call on the Commission to make contact with the government representatives and ensure that these commitments are respected until this aspect is included in Congolese law .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I understand very well the great interest of this Parliament in measures taken within and outside the Union to address the difficulties of individual Member States with regard to their financial system .
We express our solidarity with the will of the peoples , who want a better life , opportunities and a better future .
You even support the Irish , in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
We should respect this new dimension of European foreign policy , and we really must respect it in order to make the world more free , fairer and more social in the future .
My office has produced an informal document on sanctions to Syria ; we are in the lead .
When we get rid of poverty , Communism will disappear forever .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the revision of the competition rules relating to horizontal cooperation - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That was what you all fought for together , regardless of the colour , elephant or orange .
I believe that this type of measure , as well as the strengthening of the EU public food safety , bring more clarity with regard to Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU .
In view of these considerations , the implementation of the Mercosur Agreement seems to be a safe step , particularly as the Swedish Food and Technological Institute has indicated that carbon content in Brazilian beef can be 35 times higher than in Irish beef .
In accordance with the agreement , therefore , the following Article 1 ( 4 ) ( b ) of the original regulation , which is amended in Article 1 ( b ) of the regulation , must be added the following text : &apos; The same reference rate applies to revise the same non-euro &apos; in Article 4a , Article 4b and Article 6a ( 3 ) .
Today , the Irish Government has requested and rightly obtained European solidarity .
Just look at Ireland , the country hit particularly hard by the financial crisis : its membership of the monetary union protected it from the even worse consequences of this crisis .
He fears the claims of Germany regarding Sudeten property and , having listened to what my German politicians say on this subject , I think he is fully entitled to fear .
Greater assistance from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , as well as greater support for the technical activities relating to the development and implementation of projects ;
If we do not act in such a way that countries understand that , from an economic point of view , unreasonable policies will have severe consequences , we will not succeed .
We must strengthen and promote further measures aimed at preventing climate change .
( Applause from the left )
As always , I have worked very well together with my shadow team on these difficult issues - Bernadette Vergnaud , Cristian Bu≈üoi and Heide R√ºhle .
The freedom of the press and of the media in Russia are indeed a major problem .
Similarly , only each Member State can decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which are the two main European Council legislation in this area .
It is therefore a structured dialogue , which gives us the opportunity to exchange views on issues relating to us .
Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability with people who are already working with protection and some support now , so that they do not lose their jobs next year or should not go out into a new retraining and skills upgrading cycle , in order to preserve existing jobs .
Madam President , we are asking questions with the aim of highlighting the benefits of our citizens from implementing such a package and showing what we can offer in this package of measures .
I voted in favour of this report because it also significantly improves the text produced by the European Commission , particularly with regard to the protection of personal data .
In addition , we have reviewed unused funds from the 2009 budget to provide a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and the development of an additional EUR 240 million for broadband under heading II .
Thank you very much for your proposal and for the clear message .
We can see something from this here as well as the attempt to take a holistic approach that has failed , as we imagined it , but nevertheless it is the right one .
Once again , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission , which was sometimes cruel , and the Council , with whom we tried to find solutions at tripartite and night meetings , because only hours ago , they approved the sensible compromise that we had found .
In order to be able to carry out comprehensive and coordinated action , the Commission , following the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 4 May 2010 , set up a European Unit for the Coordination of Asturias .
At the same time , it should be remembered that , when it comes to illegal logging , it is hardly the problem of illegal trade in timber .
I myself come from the Azores in Portugal , where the dairy sector is very important , as well as deeply and strongly rooted in areas which are relatively vulnerable in social terms and in which it would actually be important to maintain the quota system after 2015 .
People do not come from different cultures : different cultures come from different people .
In some cases , these recommendations are good enough to consider them .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small country in terms of its population ( approximately 300 000 ) , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs play an important role in verifying the decisions on health claims .
That is why we are clearly saying &apos; yes &apos; to the Nabucco project , but equally certain is our decision to support our governments &apos; efforts to ensure that energy diversification guarantees the well-being of our citizens .
Political parties may be banned ; there are corruption in the judicial system ; there are violations of human rights ; there is no freedom of expression and association in the way that is the case in Britain and in most European countries .
It is also quite obvious that we need an energy mix containing various energy sources , which is as broad as possible , because this will stabilise the energy situation and , as a result , contribute to the diversity of each country and also Europe .
However , I am not convinced by Parliament &apos;s attempts to refer to international law by condemning certain undesirable practices .
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I expressly express my full support for the people of Tunisia and the historic democratic revolution that it has initiated .
Furthermore , it calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies , such as the national action plan or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty , and to report on a regular basis on measures to address this problem .
If you bumped the law through the Hungarian Parliament and surrender it , from now on , only a two-thirds majority can change it , and you know that it will not be easy to amend it again after the next elections .
General system of tariff preferences ( debate )
Today , we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The subject of a new sense of mutual trust poses us another major problem .
This year in addition to the EUR 9.5 million allocated to the EEAS , we will only be able to evaluate the actual costs after the first year of this service , when a report on all expenditure relating to the EEAS is submitted to the European Parliament .
My question is about Pakistan , whose permanent instability , as we all know , has affected the crisis throughout the region and also in Afghanistan .
Of course , we cannot forget the natural biological disparities that exist between men and women .
We must not forget these factors , not least when it comes to the idea of revenue generated by the proposal for the use of infrastructure earmarking .
( HU ) Mr President , what I welcome in this directive is the clearest definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution regarding the problem of the absence of specialists available in the patient &apos;s country of origin .
Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I would like to comment on the issues and subjects that have been raised .
Last week in committee , I convened the Belgian Presidency as a similar Presidency to the refugee .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the continuing violation of human rights in this country , particularly as regards freedom of association , expression and information , and I support the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran .
The rapid launch of funding will be particularly important .
One thing is to create such a mechanism , but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it .
The Agreement will boost the competitiveness of Canadian and European markets , and also increase their security , as regulatory bodies and enforcement authorities will bring their activities closer to all matters of certification , inspection and enforcement , thereby ensuring the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a general debate on the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
Furthermore , its private sector aspect not only improves Europe &apos;s image in the world , but also promotes European citizenship .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the aim of the proposal we are debating today is to amend the regulation adopted in 2004 , which improved and harmonised safety provisions for the protection of EU citizens &apos; passports and travel documents against fraudulent use , while simultaneously implementing elements of biometric identification .
Secondly , a temporary institutional framework must be created for implementing decisions .
It is good news that some of the agreements that we have recently concluded are very good , such as the free trade agreement with Korea .
It is therefore important for Parliament once again to remind the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade is aware that its current approach , namely , constructive action with the European Union , is undoubtedly more effective than attempts to rewrite history all the time .
Joci , but until now , the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments and time to influence the Latvian Government in order to prevent discrimination on the basis of the language principle .
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission in any way to support the government of Pakistan in order to immediately eliminate the devastating discrimination against religious minorities in the country .
It will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration , organised crime and human trafficking .
This is permissible , and it is legitimate , and we fought to achieve this .
It is clear that , more than any other time , financial institutions must maintain and reassess their approach .
Our common objective is to reduce by-catches and discards , and in committee we managed to achieve this .
The main objective of supporting trade is to increase the domestic and international competitiveness of 48 countries .
Even by adopting the justification for internalising external costs as a valid starting point , there is no reason not to penalise heavy goods vehicles and not to penalise ordinary cars in order to reduce traffic congestion ; just as the application of the old &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle is clearly discriminatory .
I have been encouraged by the understanding and support received during this plenary debate .
Moreover , from the point of view of the point of departure , there are some concerns .
The main aim of the European Union and the governments of its Member States , whether they are centre-right or centre-right , is to ensure the continued profitability of monopoly companies by putting the gravity of the biggest capitalist economic crisis on the working class using the European Union .
Therefore , action must be taken to spread good practice and raise awareness among local decision makers about the benefits that ICT can offer .
Mr President , we could not hear a translation of the previous speech in English .
However , for this processing , this codification has a very important point , which relates to the restructuring of all TEN-T networks over the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial to the Ukrainian people , but let us not forget that it is also a very important partner for the citizens of the European Union , because Ukraine is an important partner to us , in particular , in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe .
The Commission must therefore have a strong voice .
We cannot interfere in a matter that is the sole responsibility of the United States Government .
People who manage our forest areas are poor or not at all to ensure that hidden functions , which many people consider to be self-evident .
Unfortunately , it should also be said that the list of unresolved problems is only longer , not shorter .
With regard to Mr Salafranca &apos;s valuable report on the EU &apos;s strategic relationship with Latin America , I would like to ask the Council and the Commission , both of which are represented in Baroness Ashton &apos;s staff , to take urgent action on three issues .
There are large dealers who are strong on their markets in a number of Member States , and there are also many small traders who are more pleased than our current proposal than has been in place since 2002 , because they have seen some aspects that were not foreseen by legislators in 2002 that have not worked for their interests , but rather have made it more difficult for them to compete with large traders .
It must establish &apos; an EU regional political partnership for peace , security and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; , which was initiated by the Committee on Development by adopting the report of April 2007 .
Over these years , especially following the 2004 historical enlargement , the context and the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) have changed a great deal .
Spain is taking over the European Union Presidency &apos;s post-Lisbon plant .
In this respect , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already set out in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda , and is part of the Act on the priority operation of the Single Market .
I would like to express my full support for Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
The Commission draft was amended in accordance with the report that we are currently voting on , taking into account the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
It is therefore important for us to reach an agreement at first reading .
These are the people who need help most , and they must not be denied support on the grounds of location .
All medical assistance , regardless of its specific features , falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
However , I would like to warn the House of the fact that the recent study carried out by the European Cardiology Association has once again highlighted the serious shortcomings of this method , as very few women took part in these trials .
The idea is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but neither should they hinder the achievement of social and environmental targets .
I call for greater attention to be paid to the recovery of organic waste , especially in this mainly agricultural region , and for these data to be checked and for exchanging best practices .
It is absolutely incomprehensible that the law determines - correct priests , bishops and patriarchies must be Turkish citizens .
The most important thing in this position adopted by Parliament is to draw attention to the spread of measures that are insufficiently coherent , not only as legislation , but in particular are not coordinated .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has enabled the European Union to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least the subject of the digital Single Market is at the forefront of EU priorities .
This would be an important step forward towards transparency , openness and clarity in the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , because it would make sense to discuss this .
Is this kind of model of economic development that Europe should offer to Europe &apos;s citizens ?
It is a fact that I did not allow the speakers to exceed their time , but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s statement was particularly important to us .
We want an appropriate strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment - a strategy that will improve the quality of life of all European citizens living in the Danube region once implemented .
This is indeed a great achievement , given that , without going into the judgement of the legal basis , this directive recognises patients &apos; unquestionable rights and opens up many new possibilities of accessing better treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors has failed to give us an assurance that the EU budget has been used legally and correctly , and I was deeply concerned by the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money as the main accountant of the European Commission in 2002 .
It is a tremendous test for me and a great honour .
If we are honest , we must recognise our historic responsibility for climate change and the fact that our emissions &apos; per capita &apos; are still many times higher than Chinese and Indian emissions , for example .
I am sure that the future of the dialogue will be constructive .
We therefore regret that , in the case of Europol , for example , the rush has prevailed over the desire to respect fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal , which aims to introduce a complementary , simplified method of use of European Social Fund funds , so that the economic and social challenges facing Europe can be resolved more rapidly and effectively .
Frankly , I had to vote against the proposed composition of the Commission , but alongside the Germans , there were a number of very good candidates , including the Polish candidate , Janusz Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but there are actually 26 other Member States in the European Union without Britain , so you will understand that I have to listen to the legitimate interests of other countries too , although we are very sensitive to the concerns you expressed .
In my opinion , we must be vigilant in this regard in order to maintain the neutrality of the European Union &apos;s humanitarian aid , even if , at times , it is difficult in the regions affected by the crisis .
Moreover , this resolution lays down additional points that Parliament has already stated , such as the requirement for the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to evaluate the results of the investigations carried out by both sides and to report back to Parliament on these evaluations , to remind us that the responsibility and reliability of the EU and its Member States require full monitoring of the pressure on NGOs involved in the preparation of the Goldstone report and to include the limited extent of the investigation .
I also hope that this decision will help save the disappearing fish .
I hope that you take my question not as provocation , but as an initiative for reflection .
I have always shown my desire and , hopefully , made it possible to present the results obtained to you , but we need to examine the open .
Such a result will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade negotiations , particularly in the ongoing World Trade Organisation Doha Round .
When Europe speaks with one voice , the US will also accept the same goal .
That is why I personally support the prices imposed on European tobacco growers , at least as long as European citizens continue to smoke .
If we look at the initiatives adopted by the various Member States , it is quite clear that some countries take this problem more seriously than others .
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) being separated from European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to exceed the provision of treatment , and in 2009 two thirds of people in need of treatment had still not received it , namely the 10 million people who need help , had no access to effective treatment .
In fact , if human dignity is appreciated , we do not see minorities negatively .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals to simplify this fund .
In future , all EU institutions should check whether our budget has been designed in such a way as to help citizens and businesses out of complex economic problems and draw up a plan to restore stability .
The quickest way of cooling them more effectively and practically than all downstream measures is to support civil initiatives , cultural organisations and regional authorities &apos; activities .
To all those who are still struggling with this treaty , mistakenly assuming that this treaty strengthens the European Union , I would say : those who are fighting against this treaty are actually reinforcing the influence of our so-called partners or , if you like to say so , of our opponents .
With global capitalism taking over the European Union , we will all lose out .
The TEN-T meeting will take place shortly , in which the Commission will continue its work on the development of the transmission network of other means of transport .
You will remember that this was a difficult battle , because the dossier was also delivered to the Court of Justice of the European Communities , and the Commission - and I congratulate the Commission - worked very well and better at that time than the Council , and we fully supported the Commission .
The first man to take the floor this morning was Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the line adopted by the governments of the central EU Member States , the European Commission and the European Central Bank is clearly to be identified .
Indeed , I would like to remind the House that , according to the results of the last figures , there are still more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union , and this figure has probably already reached 25 million so far , meaning that the attraction of an even greater number of asylum seekers is , in fact , a kind of collective suicide .
The Commission must impose sanctions , not finance ministers .
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and on the EU &apos;s economic support .
We fully support the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative , but we could not support the quote which makes reference to Parliament &apos;s vote , which , among other things , supported abortion and which runs counter to the previous explanation of vote that we tabled in Parliament .
This document is a compromise that has been negotiated a long time and which improves respect for passengers &apos; rights without imposing additional burdens on carriers .
It is indeed high time that the heart of the &apos; EMU &apos; was born out of life , creating a genuine and effective economic union as the last step in integrating European economic policy .
I was particularly interested in the question of the rights of children in external relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has been trying for ten years to equip itself with legal documents on economic immigration .
Mrs Stihler &apos;s report is a valuable tool for reducing Member States &apos; administrative and technical barriers to the marketing of construction products in the European Union and creating a single market in this sector .
In my opinion , if we want to carry out the tasks that we have laid down in the agreements on foreign policy , we still have a great deal to do before we can send the migrants who are staying illegally to Libya .
This is why I endorsed the resolution on the European Innovation Partnerships within the framework initiative , the Innovation Union , and I believe that we all need to be involved in promoting innovation because , as I have already said , it is very important for the future .
We have a newly elected government in the UK that has made promises in this area .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 247 / 2006 establishing specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union - C7-0255 / 2001 - .
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand with positive results , both in environmental and in the area of job creation .
Some countries are not using all the ESF funding allocated to them - about 30 or 40 % are not used .
I would therefore like to know - although the Commission claims that it has the necessary information and that it publishes this information because it is obliged to publish it - why , for example , the case was unknown ?
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I fully support the proposal for an effective information campaign to increase the visibility of points of single contact .
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and that it wants to make economic policy objectives mandatory .
I voted today in favour of introducing enhanced cooperation on the unitary patent protection issue as I believe that the stalemate in the Council is unfounded on the linguistic order .

I hope and I am sure that your votes will serve as a basis for an agreement .
Firstly , it is a pity that there is no Commissioner McCreevy in our midst - maybe again , there is a ray season for horses !
You may not be unaware , but there is a need for extensive testing of animals , for example , to check that claim .
I am a bit of suspicious one thing , Commissioner , and that is the impact of the large group , the CARS 21 , and the industrial impact of the process that has been initiated here .
We do not agree .
The EU &apos;s support earmarked for the 2007-2013 period 2010 aims to support the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova , with more than EUR 50 million being allocated .
Of course , we cannot understand how an illegal worker takes up work and how someone who accepts him in his job to bear the cost of his residence and survival is ultimately punished .
I believe that this evaluation system , based on the approval of several research indicators , will allow for better political decisions to be taken by the public and the economy as a whole .
At the same time , I would like to stress that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be based on conditions for lifting the restrictions on freedom and directly involving the abolition of repression of peaceful demonstrators and human rights activists .
Finally , High Representative , you are going to the Middle East .
Worse still , the US Congress is back , just one month after its creation of the ICC in July 2002 , adopting the US Personnel Act .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to make it clear that this report contains amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to the resolution adopted by this plenary on 19 June 2008 , which rejected the Commission &apos;s proposal aimed at approving the trade in poultry meat for human consumption even after the processing of anti-microbs .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my deep sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo , as well as the greatest concern for the four other four prisoners in Cuba and one opposition activist who has also launched a hunger strike in protest .

Our motto should be : &apos; Do not waste any cent ! &apos;
The Union , especially the Mediterranean , has always been at the forefront of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people , as respect for the principle of solidarity towards the people living under such challenging conditions is vital .
Workers are often isolated and , in this situation , often have problematic access to trade unions .
( Laughter and applause )
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements .
However , Mrs Gullaume &apos;s report , in its present form , although it has been improved by some amendments , is a real incentive for the persons concerned to abuse the process by hindering the provision of essential services and preventing those who really need to be quickly investigated .
This is our time , and it is our responsibility to do everything we can , and I would like to thank the authors , Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer , for their excellent work for all of us .
We have taken a really huge programme with a number of very important reports .
The so-called social dumping represents a significant threat to workers , as their rights are being severely undermined .
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo .
( EL ) Madam President , I should like to ask a question about what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of each proposal : can one possibly carry out an ex ante study on this area , including on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific features of this area , so as to have criteria that will have to be taken into account by all countries from the very beginning and respect planning ?
We must also focus on the situation of Roma women , who are suffering from poverty , the problem of access to housing , discrimination and violence , and also the problem of young Roma people , as their lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to access employment in this difficult economic crisis .
I am pleased to be able to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) Regulation , in order to extend the scope of the measures in the housing sector to help marginalised communities in all Member States .
This charter recalls to all policy makers in the areas of competence that it is really important for the public authorities to have genuine freedom of the press : they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and contribute to its development .
Mr President , I believe that the European Union has become excessive , there are too many cultures in it , and I simply do not trust this system at all , and the situation will get worse .
However , it is still too soon to announce the results of this analysis , because , as the Member knows , there is a need to reach a consensus in the Council at every stage of this process .
It is important to point out that the prospect of EU integration is the strongest incentive for Balkan countries to implement the necessary reforms , as well as a contributing factor to the stability of the region .
Nowadays , when advertising is becoming increasingly important , it is essential to lay down criteria that give consumers and patients the opportunity to know fully what impact the use of these medicines is having , and to be sure about this .
Neil Armstrong &apos;s words would be a small step forward for European funds , but a huge leap for the European economy .
