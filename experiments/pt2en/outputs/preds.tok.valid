Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London is a milestone of the global response to the world crisis .
The report &apos;s conclusions debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament draw our attention to the fact that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much greater negative impact on the environment than internal production - which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions - contribute to climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that countries which benefit from these funds cannot use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime institutions of the Member States must cooperate much more closely to harmonise their training programmes , as well as offer opportunities for gainful work and exchanges of experience with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia on Europe .
What we see is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened , and the EU also needs to force the authorities in the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities .
I would like to add something that no one , with the exception of Commissioner Almunia , has so far spoken .
The areas most exposed to the effects of climate change are water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity and , last but not least , the health of the population .
Let me also express my regret , and that of the Commission , for the deaths of nine soldiers and a Turkish police officer as a result of last week &apos;s terrorist attacks .
Congratulations , Mr Piebalgs , on everything you are doing .
However , it is comforting to see that , following the opposition and the concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education regarding the devaluation of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is increasing and causing problems in various Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported , and has increased the initial allocations set out ( for example , in Article 1502 of the case of the Lifelong learning ) programme 202 .
A minority government with entirely different political conviction then took power , but no one considered that to be a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , the international community , did nothing when the Abyei issue was unresolved in the referendum is , in fact , highly irresponsible and is a recipe for war to emerge again in the future .
The case of the Romanian gambler of Andel Cozma , who is brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows us once again that crime knows no borders and that it is counterproductive to ignore the problems of this community .
The EU must have a robust food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to pool the resources of the Member States to achieve optimal results and to work on shared strategies and operations which also make Europe the political union with which its founding fathers dream for years .
That is our request .
We are all , as Hungary is from the outset , supporters of the single market .
in writing . - ( PL ) inevitable climate change is forcing society and the European Union to accommodate itself with a new reality .
Every country will continue to promote internal stability and help find solutions to both socio-economic problems and ethnic tensions .
It was an extraordinary sentimental relationship that has lasted three years and , as with most of the short-term sentimental relations , I am pleased to see it coming to an end .
NATO &apos;s need for continued monitoring and for support , especially now in Afghanistan , is essential .
We need to start somewhere , and we need to get the process in motion .
In this area , common aspects will have to be addressed , such as reduced VAT rates , exemptions to the regime , the option of establishing a maximum charge and , last but not least , the place of taxation of intra-Community transactions .
Allow me to tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the highest youth unemployment rate and our car industry has been decimated , partly because the European Union is funding jobs in Slovakia which have taken away essential jobs from the Ryton plant .
It is essential to ensure that these institutions , which still have limited experience , are not constrained to weaken or undermine the key areas for reforming the financial sector .
Enough is enough !
It will thus be possible to establish a network of research centres which will use specialist infrastructure jointly and which will share information and data useful to their activities .
Qimonda corresponds to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries , especially Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating ever more .
Mr Severin rightly described strategic reciprocity : Europe needs a strong United States and the United States needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to know if the Council can tell us that the proportion of this wave of refugees could be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do everything to remove such a requirement .
After all , it was not a food inspector or an EU food security agency which has found out , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we should use our vision of military capabilities by emphasising the power of persuasion and prevention in the approach to a new agenda , which has already been clarified in Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter a new era of negotiations on disarmament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon this evening prepared for some time in the Committee on Budgets .
In September , members of the MoDem party did not vote for the appointment of José Manuel Durão Barroso as President of the Commission , as his previous performance does not recommend his re-election .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that it focuses on animal welfare , that animals are kept in a position suited to their species , and that they are strong and robust , following the principle that prevention is better than cure .
At the moment , we fear that , if its scope is extended , the directive will have exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - that is , once again , to be blocked by the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians , Member States and the European Union place small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their economic recovery efforts .
Countries such as Britain and the US , both with deficits in excess of 10 % , will have to make significant adjustments to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep matters separate , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to continue to comment on the new press law in Hungary , and I do not think that this falls within his responsibilities .
Of course , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Beyond insulting to wine-growers who are developing a quality policy , especially in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise a derived from a mixture of finished products and allow misleading references to rosted colour that characterises the rosé .
There is a lot more to do , however .
What will happen is that there will be job losses in rural Europe and a reduction in our ability to produce food .
Let us also remember that , despite these institutional matters , this Swedish Presidency - like this autumn - is , of course , very much influenced by the need to act on climate change , by the need to act on the financial crisis , by the concern in Europe , that we need a policy for creating jobs , many important issues to be addressed .
But you can rest assured that we are fully aware that a few texts will be drafted on a new basis for this police and judicial cooperation , thereby enabling Parliament to exercise its role as colegislator .
I would also like to applaud the rapporteurs for failing to include the ethical dimension , which will , of course , fall within the competence of the Member States .
On the other hand , however , we should remember those who have already made a very significant contribution to the construction of Europe .
In other words , we are devising an Economic Recovery Plan in which we give 3.5 billion to the oligarchy of energy giants and not a euro to those partners that we need to help switch to green energy .
Fishing and stock management are essential in order to avoid total overfishing of inland waters and oceans .
We would have preferred Parliament &apos;s resources to be increased through redistribution and measures to increase efficiency rather than an increase in the global budget .
Furthermore , this package may be proof of how European institutions can cooperate responsibly , efficiently and constructively in such an important area .
I think that a &apos; front loading &apos; strategy - which the Commission is , in fact , in the review proposal - that is , an improvement in first-instance &apos; procedures , will enable us to achieve economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and have succeeded in reaching a consensus at first reading on the regulation on animal by-products .
We do not want to export Europe &apos;s jobs to countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we have .
All the contributions have been helpful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
The Hungarian Presidency must work hard to reach an understanding among 27 Member States , to reflect the unity of Europe and its willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I rise as Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights , and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , money was only intended for two types of projects , those aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere , i.e. capture and storage of CO2 ( CCS ) , and the wind farms in the North Sea .
If it were proposed to allocate funds to workers made redundant in the United Kingdom , we would vote in favour and , if we did not , we would be censored .
As regards the Court &apos;s activities , we know that the Court is fully operational , even though it is still taking the first steps .
It concerns our neighbouring countries , including the closest ones , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , and also the most far removed , such as Armenia , Tunas and Georgia .
I am very committed , like my colleagues from the Commission , that the gender perspective should be included in all the policies that we are going to put forward .
These projects will help to eliminate differences in the links between the European Union &apos;s systems and enable the use of EU energy sources to be optimised .
Another aspect is that this approach is based on policies , and I think that Europe , above all , needs more policies , and that is certainly also one of Parliament &apos;s responsibilities .
There is also the issue of FIFA intransigence in introducing balistic online technology when other sports have already done so .
After all , we have the capacity to organise various types of training or workshops , in which we can provide real help with regard to access to the EU funds earmarked for development in rural areas .
Others use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral negotiations with suppliers who often ignore the demands for transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
Furthermore , I am pleased that we have succeeded in creating a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
More specifically , many Member States have made considerable efforts to fulfil their obligations under the Pact .
The aim is to enable the European Union to respond to the major social challenges that concern all Member States and cannot respond alone ( demographic ageing and health ) , energy supply , water and food supply , sustainable development , fight against climate change , etc . ) , as well as developing knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness .
Although we intend to support the resolution tomorrow , in my view , there are still certain inconsistencies in this budget , of which I would like to emphasise two of the most important of the points .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will move on to issues relating to the governance of the global economy , in particular , to financial regulation and to timely follow-up to the Pittsburgh G20 Summit .
However , I would like to explore this in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major changes in the structure of international trade and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market .
The bottom line is at the will of Europeans to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment that would necessarily result from accession .
It is an unappreciated and difficult role .
This is at the top of our list of priorities .
However , EU support is essential to ensure this country &apos;s independence .
The Israeli Government continues its forced colonisations , and this after committing war crimes at the beginning of this year .
The assessments and visits of additional teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are prepared to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal will continue with five longstanding long-liners it already had .
the strengthening of budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities which will help to regain the arms race ;
I would also like to emphasise the contradiction between the commitment of the government of Pakistan to freedom of religion and its dominant role in supporting the agenda &apos; Combating the defamation of religion &apos; of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in the United Nations .
I say this afternoon because it is my sincere view .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , since it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment at the same time .
In this context , rapid and coordinated intervention by the European institutions and governments is essential , namely the introduction of programmes to regain old cars from a consistent reduction in the purchase price of a new vehicle , financial aid and so on .
In my view , the proposed legal basis is correct and does not , however , feel it is very consistent with more than significant entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon when the functions and competences now shared between the two pillars will be consolidated .
Madam President , success or failure , that is the issue .
This policy is doomed to failure if anyone working in the fishing sector , from fishermen to traders selling fish to consumers , does not comply with the rules .
These expensive and ineffective pseudo-parliamentary debates , masking as a good trick of illusionalism , responsible democracy that is merely a deceit to the voters who sent us here .
It is regrettable that we should be united on this matter .
We no longer say that trade liberalisation and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe , whereas in a sense this does not matter because the climate issue should prevail .
Dedebtedness - and we are witnessing the painful evidence of this fact - prevents economic growth , not only in European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this report will help to clarify and simplify the process of various aviation agreements by indicating the criteria to which we should monitor and what aspects we should monitor .
I will vote in favour of the telecoms package , but I do so with some reluctance , because I believe that there has been a fundamental betrayal at the highest level of the essential principle of the liberalisation of the telecommunications that this directive wanted to achieve .
Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office , we are in an unprecedented crisis .
If we manage to coordinate our efforts , we will maximise the impact of these packages and minimise their costs to the taxpayer .
The European Commission is preparing a draft directive to facilitate the obtaining of EU visas by Belarusian citizens and a readmission agreement .
Allow me to give a concrete example .
Take , for example , the education of children and schools .
We do not know , either , whether the standards that we are promoting in terms of trade in timber will come into force and will be applied globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this issue .
The establishment of the special committee on the financial and economic crisis is vital as the body which examines and assesses the coordination of Member States &apos; actions to support sustainable and qualitative growth .
I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and reduce bureaucracy for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for strong integrated European policies to be established .
With my abstention , I would like to express my deepest disappointment at the results of the summit , which have remained far below citizens &apos; expectations .
Late payments often cause difficulties , both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour - which is something that no one disputes - but we must not insist that all efforts fall on the citizens , because they are the only opportunity we have to get out of this crisis .
In the United States , there is already a rapid alert system in these cases .
One such case concerns one of my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , our freedom and our democracy .
To read things up : that is what Europeans have asked to elect in this Parliament and that is what we should give them if , in five years &apos; time , we want to see more citizens coming to the polls .
The parts of the text that fall within the remit of the European Council have been discussed and agreed upon by the European Council itself .
Over the last decade , final private consumer spending per capita has increased by more than 80 % .
At this point , I believe that it would be useful to promote a period of reflection on the most appropriate ways to enforce existing legislation .
The summit &apos;s conclusions on this are very vague .
In view of this , the proposal includes uniform instruments for implementing implementing executive or cautious measures so as to avoid problems concerning the recognition and translation of instruments coming from other Member States , and a standard form for notification of documents relating to credit on the territory of another Member State .
I am in favour of these proposals for the 2011 budget because important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes to support cooperation at European level .
For example , the Council &apos;s decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 , which established the capacity of Member States to cooperate at intergovernmental national level to prosecute such crimes , thankfully - and we all remember General Pinochet - are even part of the legislation of certain Member States .
Thank you very much .
My vote should not be seen either as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy &apos; .
Our purchases are becoming ever more remote and the Internet has changed our habits completely , partly because our lives are made more troubled .
As far as information is concerned , as we receive new data immediately .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in new generation education , and I refer to lifelong learning .
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that these issues have been resolved satisfactorily in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , there are thousands of people involved , in many cases with small children and not enough money .
The appeals procedure before the Commission under the possible future Treaty of Lisbon and the appeals procedure before Parliament are completely different .
Human rights must be respected by all parties to the conflict in the Middle East .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised question marks about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all need to shoulder our responsibilities .
We have been informed , in any case , UNESCO has already approached the Chinese authorities on the impact of urbanisation on traditional heritage and culture in Kashgar .
Mr Schwab has presented a report whose aim is to increase the safety of cars by introducing more safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I have therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown the ability to act and have strengthened our resistance .
If we talk about Parliament &apos;s position with the external bodies , for example , with the human rights organisations that could be affected by this , and if we cannot reach an agreement , we cannot carry out individual projects - although I hope this will not happen - I believe there will be support and understanding for Parliament &apos;s position .
These Thursday afternoon sessions of the European Parliament are becoming increasingly surreal , both by the vacuum we see , by the topics discussed and by the way they are handled .
I think it is not yet quite clear whether Moldova will be able to elect its President , and if that does not happen , Moldova will obviously move towards further elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 , when 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome this compromise , because it raises the issue of the democratic deficits that women in particular had to face for years when they help their husbands independent worker in trade , the artisanal industry , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , without any recognition over time for their work .
Of course , our policy options are quite different and sometimes divergent .
I will call it &apos; climate justice &apos; , because what this is about is the relationship between developing countries and developed countries , and the desire to come up with a credible proposal to finance both mitigation measures and adaptation measures , and also the way in which we show our readiness to take a lead .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone here of the State aid granted to the banks , who have benefited from the aid but did not adopt the corresponding social approach .
I have not only three children but also a grandchildren who , at the moment , have nothing more to do with milk .
We are prepared to draw up technical assistance programmes to monitor the difficult austerity measures which the Greek authorities must implement .
We await the Commission to do so .
As the honourable Member says , the statistics still need to be updated , and Eurostat is looking at the issue .
Sometimes , I wonder if we have not learnt the lessons from the consequences of our actions well by not adopting European solutions to European problems and trying to find something specific , even though we have to deal with this collectively .
Ee-mails have also shown that scientists who are sceptical about that hypothesis have been excluded from peer analysis procedures in order to avoid disparities when research has been revealed to the public .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
The Internet has made this very obscure part of society we are still struggling with .
We are well aware of the kind of people we are dealing with in this context , and therefore the institutions must be aware , in relation to the inspections , that they represent a higher risk , and so there must be stricter inspections .
Our priority during the work on reviewing the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical equipment and e-devices sold in the European Union .
Prevention work is being done , particularly in schools , because this social group is most vulnerable to drug addiction .
It has successfully extended to bring the continent together at the end of the Cold War and it is now being called upon to preserve previous achievements and to continue integration as soon as they return to better times .
There are many Members who want to see their questions answered this evening and , out of respect for them , we will take this period in an orderly manner .
But those who , like us , were involved in this process knew that there was no other alternative , that the problems of the dairy sector had to be solved and that they will hopefully have found the way to resolve some of the problems that were affecting some of the sector .
The second is that , although the ECR Group gives its full support to the need for maternity and paternity standards , we have chosen to abstain on references of this kind because we oppose any family policy being imposed at EU level ; this is a matter for national governments to decide .
Just to make one last but not least point , I would say that the upcoming discussions that we are having on this subject should include the issue of the European Union Border Assistance Mission for the Egyp-Palestinian position in Rafah ( EUBAM Rafah ) , in order to examine how we can reactivate and possibly extend that mission .
The Commission is therefore following the situation and , if necessary , will act , but I think that we should not go beyond the structures laid down in EU law , and the Commission will certainly remain within the limits of that legislation .
Since our common ambition is to see a real European diplomatic service that is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the financial regulation and the regulation on the Staff Regulations , which we are going to debate today and vote on tomorrow , are of the greatest importance .
in writing . - Bearing in mind the persistent differences between men and women in terms of employment , salaries and access to management positions , I invite Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC and to ensure full and effective transposition of provisions into national legislation .
I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I want to ask the Commissioner that no progress will be made in the coming weeks unless these fugitives are brought to justice .
We will deal with this soon when we discuss the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The European Parliament today , Wednesday , 20 October , adopted the report by its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
We are already talking about tax increases that will be mandatory in the near future to balance public finances .
The time has come for us to demand the right of Christians and believers of other religions to freely profess their faith .
Throughout the EU , 31.5 % of women work part-time ( 30 or less a week ) , against just 8.3 % for men .
I share the cautious optimism , both from the Commissioner and the Minister , and I believe that the sky is less touched , but that there are still many clouds .
At that time , few of us could have postponed the scale of the approaching economic crisis .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction , showing it is on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this sound report .
This policy has become essential feature of the economic recovery package , providing added value and supporting efforts at sustainable modernisation and economic growth , while at the same time demonstrating European solidarity .
On the other hand , unfortunately , we still do not know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , and it is clearly necessary to put it into force without hesitation .
However , I believe that the situation clearly shows the enormous difficulties that the agricultural sector is experiencing , and particularly in my region , when farmers have to queue for days outside winter in order to try to obtain modest sums of EU funding .
The Member States of southern Europe have left the Member States very late .
What must be achieved by implementing smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the EU 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will in a democratic vote , which is why tomorrow is a very important day .
It has to be said that housing is an essential necessity and a right for all citizens , particularly in the modern state of provision .
It seems to me that defining priorities that are policies means that they must be scrutinised , they must be transparent , they must be democratic .
This project in particular concerns the deployment of the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , you have reign a climate of fear in Voivodina in the north of Serbia among the various nationalities that live there , and above all among Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise , a difficult compromise sometimes , and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved , on our behalf , a practical and feasible result .
Do we agree with the parts of the proposal that Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council in relation to access to meetings and information , which stipulate regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation in the citizens &apos; initiatives , assessments of the impact of legislation and the use of non-binding legal acts ( instead of coercive legislation ) , but we disagree with the reaffirmation and strengthening of the use of EU directives on the language application of directives .
Everyone knows that there can be no transmission without access to radio spectrum , and it is EU policy to ensure that all market players have non-discriminatory access to spectrum .
This will give us a fairly comprehensive overall framework for action by the Commission in terms of progress on equality between men and women in the areas that Mrs Malmström has just mentioned , from work to other forms in which it is important to ensure and ensure such equality .
We hope that the other heavy pieces of politics and the economy will also put their proposals on the table , which has not been the case so far with regard to some of them .
Dementia and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular are not only serious medical problems , but also an extremely sensitive social and ethical problem , the seriousness of which will continue to rise with the ageing population of Europe .
I would also like to say that you have been careful to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs , who have had to deal with this very sensitive subject : Mr Szájer and Mrs Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Ms Dahl .
Let us stay in the country , with the full support of all the European institutions , and now , please , Minsk , accept it , because it has a lot to gain from it , just like the people of Belarus .
We must keep a close eye on what is happening , because the President said that we would have an annual economy of EUR 38 billion on the part of European companies .
Now , following the trial against Liu Xiaobo , we have even seen a homosexual party being forbidden by the police , which clearly threatens to cause a ice age in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , the report you have presented to us today on Ukraine is very clear .
We must recognise that this will only happen with the involvement of parliaments , because it is only through most of the regulations that can be properly adopted , and that the process and proposals associated with the Transatlantic Dialogue between legislators and the Transatlantic Assembly are of the utmost importance .
Someone spoke of helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I was very pleased to see you here and to hear your speech .
That is what I would like to emphasise in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to women who help husbands in their self-employed work .
Anyone who was in Gaza after the conflict was able to witness the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is the most important strategic association of the European Union .
I have to say that our ambition is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , the high number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting gives me hope that the action of so many allies can finally have a chance of success .
Mr President , I would like to speak in favour of the proposal to prevent this resolution from going ahead , and what I have heard from Mr Schulz is , in fact , extremely significant : if there is indeed a desire to encompass the &apos; Europe &apos; in this debate and not limit it to Italy , then there is no point in our opinion on a resolution called &apos; freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
It proposes the adoption of the regulation proposed by the Council as soon as possible , as the new regulation would not only simplify the management of procedures but also ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals with legal residence within the framework of social security .
This is an outrageous number and it is a number that I mentioned in a report that I drafted in the previous parliamentary term of this Parliament .
But the definition of an Arctic policy is perhaps not as bizarre as the appointment of the suddenly unqualified Baroness Ashton , Sarah Palin of the former student left , for the post of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs .
One of these achievements is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October , which is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union , and which should remain a reference for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 level because I firmly believe it is necessary for there to be a budget reduction , and the position of Conservatives represents a weak starting point for the negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I believe that we have attached very little importance to the development of new completely different types of cars - hydrogen cars , electric cars , batteries and fuel-powered cars .
Then we will separate ourselves .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand , the European Union stands ready to support the country as far as its possibilities are concerned during this complicated process .
In fact , in order for this derogation , which should create jobs and wealth , to truly benefit the local populations and not to undermine European fish processing and canning industries , it was essential to provide for an impact assessment to be carried out as quickly as possible and to allow their suspension , where necessary .
That is what the Commission and the Council are now doing in a very laudable way to ensure that gas supplies are resumed as soon as possible ; threatening legal procedures is , of course , not a very effective option .
It is essential that Member States investigate , without delay , the huge human rights violations against Roma women , penalise criminals and ensure that all victims are identified and receive compensation .
( LT ) Mr President , this is really quite complex .
I would like to draw attention to the significance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies , but also - and this has not been said - to the significance of cooperation with national parliaments , especially with parliamentary committees on European issues , budget budgets and budgetary control .
Now that the European External Action Service is putting into practice its rules on access to information and documents , I suggest to you that it be a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not see foreign policy as an exclusive area of some diplomats guided by secrecy .
Every country is changing its economic policies to get out of the unfavourable economic situation as soon as possible , and at least to regain economic growth .
And let me tell you the same about the Japanese people .
President Barroso said in answer that he was an internal matter .
We are therefore part of those who believe that it should not be weakened , on the contrary , it must be preserved and strengthened .
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity directly arise from the Christian tradition .
While it is helpful for large companies , it changes the normal functioning of public transport and is responsible for the decline in the network and safety .
On the other hand , discussion of the future accession of Turkey to the European Union cannot be left by side .
This risk must be managed effectively and , as the tragic events in Japan have urgently pointed out .
The main objective of the agreement is to increase the protection of workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp injuries used in medicine .
Furthermore , I hope to go to Albania next week , and I can briefly conclude my report this evening , but for myself and the European institutions , the work is still a long way from over .
Firstly , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and I would like to point out that my group - from the first time - has been very careful in accepting SIS II , given the numerous implications for data protection .
Proper conditions must exist .
The Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints in 2009 , whereas in 2008 , there were 3 406 , which represents a 9 % decrease .
In its October judgment , the European Court of Justice clearly rejected compulsory retirement when it comes to the retirement age .
There is also great potential for the exploitation of EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety and the environment , and for the proper functioning of road transport , because they can be used to levy charges .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for nearly a third of the budget , the situation remains in which the only budgetary area in which the error is estimated to exceed 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for tabling a report which has received majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The solutions proposed to emerge from the crisis and to create a &apos; green economy &apos; , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , are intended to gain access for large companies to new cost-effective sectors and not to protect the environment and meet the needs of the working classes .
I therefore share the concern that the Prime Minister expressed that such important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency can be distorted by debates on national issues or on peculiarities , rather than value what unites us .
I agree with the conditional payment of the costs based on prior consent , in justified and defined cases with precision , where cross-border healthcare includes the stay of a patient for at least a night in a hospital and highly specialised and expensive equipment is required , or where there is a particular risk to the patient or to the general population .
The most important way for us to lead would have been , and it is still , to point to a more stringent reduction target of at least 30 % .
Access is particularly harmful to those who are making real efforts to mitigate environmental damage .
Previous scandals relating to the granting of visas show the extent to which the approach of some states to issuing visas is neglected .
The impoverished populations in rural areas , after all those who need funding most , are left to their fate once again .
I know that you are up to these challenges .
( CS ) Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to welcome you very warmly to the European Parliament .
Mr Orbán was not present to the European Parliament political groups as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; , with populist and nationalist speech , which is &apos; protecting the Hungarian people against &apos; attacks &apos; .
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I therefore evaluate the report positively and I congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need the help of Russia to convince Iran not to make nuclear weapons .
I am totally opposed to the idea of the United States carrying out preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
However , this is just one of the conditions for the stability of Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important piece of work that enables us to define a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
This is what we have committed ourselves to : to creating the conditions for the fishing industry to be truly sustainable and to be developed in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the Arctic region are harsh , but also no one doubts that with new technologies and technical progress , the area will inevitably be exposed to a more intensive exploitation of its natural resources , such as fish stocks .
The unemployment rate among young people has reached the 20 % threshold at the start of the year due to the economic crisis , while the school dropout rate has risen to 17 % , mainly affecting young people in rural areas .
At present , there is a mergers of environmental labels with texts and illustrations that can merge consumers and which ranging from forest images containing hazardous substances to axed carbon footprint parts of some food products and to the proclamation of green cars .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it presupposes the responsibility of European countries for the difficult situation of non-developed Third World countries rather than attributing the responsibility to those countries .
rapporteur . - Madam President , my apologies for taking your time and delaying lunch , but I do so only once in ten years , so maybe you do not mind .
This is a sensitive job ; it needs to change things for the better and it simply does not have sufficient experience .
Just last year we agreed to repeal these rules and , although consumers have not noticed a great deal of difference , our producers have noticed and still notice .
I believe that the proposals contained in this package are not ambitious enough , insofar as they are only aimed at austerity and at reducing the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy budget to be reduced , because that would mean that agriculture is worth less in Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of these huge units , planned in economic calculations , entails significant direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to clearly express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction at the compromise proposal negotiated .
President of the Republic of Latvia , Mr Zatlers , it is a great pleasure for us to be able to welcome you today , on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the tragedy has unfolded .
When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration can go , and there is also a readmission agreement - that is the aim - which reinforces the European Union &apos;s agreements with that third country - is this global approach and the philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration - then the borders of the Member States of the Union are strengthened .
We regret that the report has not taken our suggestion fully into account , but we welcome the fact that it is reaching a conclusion that is very close to our own .
Given that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an environment of opening global trade is one of the tasks that President Durão Barroso is assigned to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I will take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner in the Chamber to ask him what he thinks of cooperation with his colleague in charge of agriculture in terms of concluding the negotiations in the Doha Round .
The report proposes simplifying control of financial aspects and strengthening technical and scientific assessment by peer assessment based on excellence .
It is in this context that the proposals now being made should be included , analysed and understood .
It is also worth highlighting the legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , financial rules and , in some cases , intellectual property ) , which may discourage the participation of a large number of the major players in the field of research and SMEs .
I would like to know , however , whether the European Commission will re-examine Directive 2007 / 52 on the points that it has just mentioned .
For this reason , I also voted in favour of the provisions relating to corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , with regard to the new point that we have drawn up together , that is , the question of transparency , progress has been very slow and , in reality , with the new regulation on access to documents , it is clearly diminishing the chances of those who start up infringement proceedings , or who call for entry , to know why these procedures are closed or open .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that this is not the first time in this Chamber that unfortunately is always half-empty at this hour we have discussed the terrible human rights situation in Burma .
It is therefore up to society to take action so that women and men can decide freely between the two logical options , in which each one has a reason to exist when considering it to be from a broader perspective than that of work .
Currently , this cartel promotes the consumption of low-nutritional products , leaving thousands of livestock farmers unable to trade their production in a country that produces 50 % of their needs .
At the moment , it is not yet possible to clearly assess all the implications of the current situation in our portfolio and in the development of our activity .
In the context of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is still of the importance that it has always had - perhaps even more than ever before .
Fossil fuels generate a centralised , hyerarchical and inflexible distribution of energy .
In this regard , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU is already half-way , so it is worth taking stock .
I believe that the review of the first railway package should identify the problems facing Member States and that have received reasoned opinions from the Commission , as well as a method for resolving them .
Israel does not realise that a military retaliation of this scale encourages new , potential suicide bomb bombs and encourages new Kasset attacks on the first opportunity .
The authorities in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and calls for his release by a large number of countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , the Secretary-General ASEAN and a number of Member States of ASEAN , of which Burma is also , by sign .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , has drawn attention to the fact that the guarantees of the EU budget for the EIB &apos;s activities have reached a figure of almost EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , which is a long way to the EU , and therefore in my opinion it is justified that Parliament should have expected an explanation of the risks associated with these guarantees .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved the draft , but on behalf of Mr Soini , and of me myself , I would now like to determine the whereabouts of the information on the project , which will be required of the citizens of all the Baltic countries before construction works start .
Without the active participation of the Czech Republic , this would never have existed .
I think it is essential to develop information campaigns on this issue .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has failed to verify the identity documents of the people of Kosovo .
Clear and strict rules have also been taken and introduced in this area .
Do you prefer a vision , such as that proposed by Mr Corbett , which leads to the United States of Europe , or a more flexible , free-based vision advocated by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Ms Toia , on the quality of the report before us today .
This is not impunity - impunity is to prolong this for many years .
It is rare to find someone by considering so many qualities .
I firmly believe that everyone in Slovenia would agree to such an immediate test in Krško .
The fact that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit on this Thursday does not bode well .
We have seen that much has already been done to meet these standards , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to meet all the requirements as quickly as possible .
In conditions such as these , it allows the Moldovan Government to fund its population programmes and uncertain European agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the ATM Research Programme in the Single European Sky ( ESAR ) , when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , it would ray cynicism .
That way we would be &apos; killing two birds of one stone &apos; , as such a infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and create jobs and , at the same time , mitigate the effects of crises with the same characteristics .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Khanty-Mansiysk , it was agreed that our shared objective would be to conclude a strategic agreement providing a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations in the foreseeable future and help develop the potential of our relations .
At the moment , it is clear that we are still lagging behind the requirements in relation to the affairs of the Mediterranean region and particularly of Libya : we need to consider a little more to recognise that perhaps we need more robust action to understand what is happening and also to put in place concerted measures for the Mediterranean .
The considerable European funding for this line had as a condition the support of the local populations for the project and the existence of private Italian funding .
( SK ) Madam President , reports on the accession processes of the Balkan States were published a week ago .
We have therefore also abstained from the proposals of the EPP on TVI issues in Portugal , even though the criticism of the CFP is known about this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development suggested a country-by-country reporting scheme , which would force multinational companies to draw up reports .
One fundamental issue referred to in the report is the problem of prostitution and the trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to the conclusion , even with the arrest and trial of Ratko Mladić and Hadžić , the Court &apos;s work will not be finished .
Furthermore , I urge the Commission to support damages actions for damages and damage to the misled businesses which , without knowing , have sold their own livestock .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) with the aim of improving the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increasing the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to be able to find solutions , we must use the same approach in future .
But , as you know , our message is as follows : structural reforms ; structural reforms aimed at increasing Europe &apos;s growth potential and Europe &apos;s job creation capacity are absolutely essential .
Such a partnership could be , in particular , during the current global financial crisis , of the greatest importance by providing increased opportunities for trade , science and technological exchanges and enabling us to emerge from this crisis in stronger and more stable positions .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
The adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon bring with it an increase in responsibility for Parliament , with its administrative burden that it bears .
In the context of an unprecedented crisis , which destroys hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to prevent the number of unemployed or poor European workers from reaching 25 million in 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed together with four Members of this Parliament , which was approved by half of the European Parliament , and which aims to oblige the Council and the Commission to adopt legislation that is truly effective in combating corruption .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully endorses your programme for Parliament and the running of Parliament over the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let them keep these promises !
We believe that it is precisely through this kind of dialogue that we will be able to help these countries , especially by increasing the participation of civil society .
Although , as a socialist , we believe that , under Sri Lanka &apos;s current conditions , wars do not represent a solution , the Tamil people see the right to defend themselves against military repression .
It is the opportunity to defend simpler , less costly measures for SMEs , which will , of course , lead to the possibility of more employment and more growth .
In the fight against this phenomenon , it is very important that we adopt harmonised security measures within the European Union , including packaging .
Whenever we talk about collective legal proceedings , it refers to the question of the US , experiences and exaggerations of this country .
The immediate entry into force of the EU-US Agreement on Axitarian Maintius and Extradition Agreement will foster criminal cooperation and remove the grey area that has enabled flights to transfer illegal prisoners .
I have three proposals and would like you to support them very directly .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already received several petitions that would make sport a service of purely social benefit in specific cases , or that instead also embrace economic aspects , making sport a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens must be given the highest priority in this institution and that citizens must be aware of this .
Only time will it say whether this will be a secondary issue or whether the undoubtedly positive impacts of the directive will prevail .
Updating freight logistics and promoting co-modality , in other words , combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain , represents an opportunity to make the Baltic region more prosperous .
In my opinion , it is up to the Member States to decide democratically whether or not they wish to ratify this ILO convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income varied from EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that is to be adopted is not so bad .
The Copenhagen Summit was disappointing in several ways .
We call on international donors , whether governmental or non-governmental , to cease their activities in certain areas in the event of the adoption of this draft law .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights and something that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you , Mr President .
Mr Havel has told us here today that Europe is the homeland of our homeland .
Therefore , if I address a police officer in Slovakia in Hungarian , it is obliged to answer me in Slovak , even if the mother tongue is Hungarian , and regardless of the fact that I do not understand its response .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to address once again one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the area of police and justice , namely the question of SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , that is , the transfer of SWIFT data to the US .
In 2009 , we saw an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection used both by individual members of the European Union and by the new developing economies .
In the case of the SWIFT Programme , the issue of transparency has not been taken seriously either by the Commission or by the Council .
Finally , on the political side , it is important that we have an alliance with the ACP countries within the framework of the WTO .
We need another path .
If we succeed in bringing together a family wishing to have children , we will be making an important contribution to this cause .
As an important step in making the EU 2020 strategy a success , I would therefore like to mention specifically how essential it is that the various EU institutions no longer compete with each other and we cooperate seriously when it comes to instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza will force us to have a more strategic and long-term vision for Gaza .
Other indicators need to be developed which will help to explain which factors influence a country &apos;s standard of living .
According to the medical experts , the treatment with the right medicines can postpone up to a year the need for the person affected by the disease to be transferred to an institution of high level care .
Commissioner Tajani , the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship , has committed himself to looking at the damage in this sector .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions aimed at implementing the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is basically a vote on the position of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent global context and in the midst of an economic and financial crisis , the European Union must strengthen its strategic autonomy to preserve its values , pursue its interests and protect its citizens by developing a common vision of the major challenges and threats and by pooling its capabilities and resources to respond adequately , thereby helping to preserve international peace and global security .
We note the good moment of relations between both sides and the positive assessment of the current global agreement .
The common register will be a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , and it is to be hoped that it will contribute to greater legitimacy of the European project among citizens .
I suggest that you look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore advocate a proactive approach .
the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening surveillance of budgetary positions and economic policy surveillance and surveillance - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
However , if we want to deal with this problem successfully , we must keep our action in strong and decisive political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I have drawn your attention .
I would like the exclusions , regardless of how they are structured , to be granted or subject to a defined deadline , or to certain criteria - perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it is to be put forward to meet the requirements of India .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning I have heard anything against the Italian Prime Minister , unless , thanks to his entrepreneurial activities , he gives employment to tens of thousands of people .
Whether it is timely or not , this is , of course , a matter for Parliament itself to consider .
This report therefore serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme , while also calling for modifications , particularly with regard to the excessive administrative and financial burden and the weak success rate , which maintain the programme that is too prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises , at a time when they play an important role in transforming research results into products and services , and in ensuring better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders in the national research sector .
The issue is that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis ; it took sides .
Similarly , it will not lead to a loss of competitiveness in our industries .
You call for an overall ban on so-called &apos; whole-body scanners &apos; .
Statistics data show that cardiovascular diseases are responsible for 4.3 million deaths in Europe every year and over 1.7 million people die from cancer .
Vaccines are the most efficient and cheapest public health measure to protect citizens from infectious diseases , but it is important that healthcare also reach developing countries in order to help increase life expectancy and combat poverty .
It must therefore be said loud and clear that exploitation by banks of the new rules introduced in the euro area in order to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens is pure stupidity .
It is imperative that in this economic situation , and even more so in this European Parliament , we ensure that expenditure is permanently controlled .
This is why , in my opinion , enhanced protection of the rights of Industrial Propriety , including patents , is essential to European competitiveness .
This man has played an extremely important role because he has seen all the trials held at the Supreme State Security Court and has been regularly involved in assessments of the conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters , and we need greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
It then seems that each of the new Member States would respect the fundamental principles of the EU and the prohibition of discrimination , as well as protect and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
The recession has hit both financial credit and social credit .
These new measures would make it possible to help both European citizens and businesses to defend their rights , especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and their social and residence prerogatives .
This question on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a one-off question .
In its conclusion , the Council encourages the European Commission to continue its impact assessment in order to prepare , if necessary , an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
I pray this : men have the right to fully participate in the family experience of their children &apos;s first days of life .
These intentions deserve attention and not criticism , even though this is not the main issue here .
The reality is that we in the EU need to anchor our absolute dependence on Russian energy supplies .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 111st trading partner , representing trade relations between the European Union and Canada in 2010 , 1.6 % of total EU foreign trade .
I would first like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced it in our Rules of Procedure was Marylène Renault , not me .
The fisheries sector in the country is still absolutely underdeveloped .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate , I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the work they have done and the European Commission for their cooperation .
On the summit , I fully agree that it comes at an important time .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which will apply - and I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - uniformly and not in the entire EU , without affecting the current cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that China &apos;s representatives can study the documents of the archives of his government in the exhibition to make sure that he did not promote violence .
It is your response to the question that has restored its development and integration into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day , we find ourselves in the media or here in Parliament with numerous demagogic allegations without the minimum technical basis .
As human rights represent an essential aspect of the agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must be dependent on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings because it is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , as it directly affects the buildings in which they live and which they use .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position on exemptions - albeit temporary ones - to the principles on which the European Union is founded , including the four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not agree that it is acceptable for this House to use this as a justification for demanding a bigger budget .
It is time to put an end to this unilateral privilege enjoyed by the United States at last .
Now that we finally have this directive , I would like to ask Commissioner Dalli and the Commission to focus more attention on the social security regulation , which is the system on which everything is based , and to clarify who receives the payments and where everything is well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common objective and work together with the Arctic states and with the international community in seeking a better and more effective way to preserve and protect the Arctic for future generations .
I think it was extremely necessary and it is a good example of this achievement by Parliament in preparing the budget , using funds which , let us say , were not being used in other areas .
Now let us consider the chances .
In order for this to happen , we must make every possible effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In sectors as sensitive as that of clothing , laissez-faire or furniture , the creation of conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is crucial to those that have decided to maintain production in Europe , thus preserving the know-how of Europe and employment in Europe .
Indeed , despite the fact that violence against women has been the subject of debate for several decades , the international community has failed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument , promoting the strengthening of relations with partner countries , providing some tangible benefits .
Moreover , it is not only Mr Barroso that is at stake .
In this case , the Commission not only has the right , but also has a duty to give an opinion .
However , with this draft document , we have overturned that barrier and we did so for the need to care for patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance and urgency of these proposals .
In my opinion , all patients have a right to quality healthcare and care that is provided in their own language , close to where they live and close to their families .
When we speak in this House , we must use the terms that everyone accepted , and FYROM , the candidate country , was accepted as &apos; FYROM &apos; and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
Such synergy is possible and will lead to an improvement in the results .
The latest developments in the European economy , particularly around Greece , have shown that there is a pressing and urgent need to strengthen Europe &apos;s economic governance .
In order not to lag behind , this party &apos;s sponsor , Stuart Wheeler , said that the costs amount to GBP 120 billion per year , about 36 times more than the real figure .
I hope that this dual approach to the issue of Belarus - bolster and pride , as Mr Tannock has said - will be successful .
We could talk about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation - could choose the subject , but I think the most important thing is that we have this fundamental agreement on the three reports tabled today , on which we have been doing over the last period .
Then I also said that the Commission should start examining the possibility of issuing European bonds - finally , it is a case to say .
Lithuanian law on the protection of minors ( debate )
This is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Enterprises and SMEs
According to this regulation , manufacturers of tyres should use rolling and autocollar labels to provide users with information on fuel consumption and resistance to rolling , weaponry grip and noise outside the corner .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In this attempt to achieve more ambitious and bold results , I also believe that , in the final phase of negotiating the COP16 negotiations , some flexibility should be granted to the chief of negotiations on behalf of the European Union , so that it is able to react to the developments that negotiations will be noted .
Therefore , balanced and transparent measures are essential , as one of the basic conditions for the success of this initiative is to win the trust of our entrepreneurs .
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of extensive urbanisation on the environment , especially in coastal areas and Spanish islands , but also in other areas , such as around Madrid .
It is important to monitor the situation very closely by the special official for Central Asia in coordination with the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy .
These processes should not overlook the necessary maintenance and surveillance after closure , waste treatment , its storage and decontamination , the environmental requalification of the facilities and support for replacing the energy capacity of the decommissioned plants , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is what I think .
I come from a country where every time I am going to the supermarket I see an individual moving from cylope with a box of timber on the spokesman .
For example , the issue of fertile land selling has been debated extensively in developing countries and the problem of countries which do not have arable land ; the purchase of these is an extremely interesting topic for themselves , and I think that this is also something that can be common understanding .
Without a European-wide network , however , the European Union &apos;s main objectives will not be met .
In Europe , tobacco is established in 17 of the 27 Member States , with subsidies provided by their governments in every case .
One of the three - English , French or German - will be used to ensure automatically legal protection throughout the EU .
This is a very controversial issue in Ireland and profitable for the advocates of a &apos; no &apos; vote on the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Presidency has done everything possible to reach an agreement , but in the end , it should be decided by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our most old trading partners , we cannot deny that we sometimes differ in our views .
So that is how the Commission will work .
This could have been one-off , however , due to the change in ESM to its definitive facilities .
The proposed amendments will allow developing Member States , which include Romania , to use this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members across this House praising the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
It goes without saying how important these two issues are in this situation .
We will work together to conclude the Doha Round with a positive outcome in 2010 , insofar as this is of the utmost importance for the efforts to recover and combat protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a very special day for me because , after ten years of good and fair service , this is my last sitting in the chair in Brussels .
Under the prism of efficiency , it also seems interesting to me that these delegations take some consular roles , such as Schengen visas .
It seems that we have spent a great deal of time discussing among ourselves instead of discussing with others on a daily basis and have been severely defeated .
In my view , the Commission &apos;s draft requires better preparation , and Parliament should therefore have more time to make its decision .
Perhaps there are more ambitious plans than those currently on the table .
All Member States would be in a much worse situation without the European Union and without its protective shield .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome India &apos;s considerable progress towards the universality of primary education , poverty reduction and increased access to drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso , with the Treaty of Lisbon on the hand , said that in the area of the environment , those who speak on behalf of the European Union are the Commission .
Opinions can be expressed , there may be disagreement , even the Eurosceptics are allowed , but the end result must always be the same .
Mr Lukashenko , Mr Lukashenko , in the political game , has managed to take advantage of his electoral programme and enjoy all the political and economic benefits , and continues to show contempt for democracy and human rights .
Still in line with the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude agreements on the small border traffic between Russia and the Member States of the European Union that could be interested .
This is a crucial point for the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , it is the very thing that we have to talk about gaps that still need to be filled in the implementation of our legislation in a number of Member States .
We should treat these people as free and respectful .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without being the target of their bombardments .
We must do everything in our power to ensure its proper recycling , not only to prevent damage to the environment and health , but also to reduce loss of raw materials .
I have to remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still the subject of an international arrest warrant , which the authorities in this country are unaware of .
This charter also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of operation of the project , and the preparatory work was started .
Mr President , I had expected you to respond with a warning reminder .
As regards the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is essentially sound as it deals with a ban on and the gradual replacement of products which have a serious harmful effect on human health .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to define the fishing opportunities for European Union vessels on the basis of the surplus available , as well as the financial contribution separately to access rights and sectoral support .
We in the EU must give the new Tunisian unity government all the support and also provide the necessary assistance to EU citizens , including British citizens , who were stranded in Tunisia when they wanted to go there on holiday .
Ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe that it is right and proper for the island of Taiwan to be transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional media often fail because of commercial interests or because their administrators belong to a given political environment and indirectly oblige their collaborators to self-censorship .
We cannot coexist in the European Union until this continues and , as a result , we believe it is extremely important that the Commission , the European Union authorities and all of us present proposals of the same content in order to put an end to this situation .
This is something , and I will also pay close attention to a set of social , environmental and economic criteria , as I have committed to ensuring that all laws are assessed in advance .
That is why I voted in favour of the report on the Seventh , Eighth , ninth and 10th European Development Funds .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner Georgieva , it is very good that we talk about Belarus here in the European Parliament , but to speak is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to express my support and to speak in favour of the request .
Next , I am pleased that East Jerusalem is considered the capital of the future Palestinian state , or the Jerusalem of the two states .

The FVO also saw major shortcomings in the traceability system applied by Brazil and found problems with many remittances in transit to the European Union that were not accompanied by the required certificates .

I therefore believe that the most important question now is : what can we do and how to continue with the results of the Swedish Presidency ?
The role of the European Union should be strengthened following this crisis .
It is central to this proposal to continue with the idea that dialogue is reciprocal , that the opinions expressed must be heard and respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to raise Polish names in the streets and cities of regions where the majority of residents belong to the Polish minority .
Given that all these actions are linked , they are indispensable and match the degree of ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious outcome as soon as possible in order to meet the expectations of the citizens .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it represents a significant improvement in the current situation .
It is from this perspective that I voted in favour of the document .
The aim of this report is greater risk tolerance , simplifying bureaucratic control mechanisms and creating greater trust in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I value Mr Daul &apos;s comments .
Parliament was the first European institution to establish a register for lobbyists in 1996 .
As the representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission a question , who has been busy dealing with the situation in the images that have arrived in the last weeks of the Mediterranean , where many people who have fled to the conflict in Africa have managed to reach Europe , and has not had the same fate .
That is not what is happening , however , which is a sad example of the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel is bombing and destroying a ghetto .
It is important to hear people &apos;s opinion , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the CAP and global food security is important .
I would like to thank Members for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
This needs to be a partnership based on mutual respect , respect for our commitments , and also for the values that the European Union stands for in terms of human rights and democracy , as well as the principle of the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and creates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
On this issue , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled an amendment which asks not only for Europe , of course , is also very addressed to the United States , as you know very well , for all forms of export subsidies to be abolished very quickly .
Most participants emphasise the need to focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture , the response to climate change , the safety and quality requirements of food and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , extremely important that the European Union increase specific subsidies for cities , as this is where the great potential of the economy and finance lies , because cities have been hit particularly hard by the crisis .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will only be presented officially in the Committee on Budgetary Control for next week .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , as recommended by scientists , and to halt the decline in biodiversity , we need significant financial resources .
Only the fundamental dynamic of the accession process , the carrot and stick of one hand and the other , can enable the governments of those countries to concentrate their efforts on continuing their work and the reforms which will , for once , be able to consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will concentrate on two of the reports , given their importance .
In the interests of the legal certainty of all those involved , the same rights are necessary throughout Europe for suspects of offences and the existence of compulsory information on these rights .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy are under national sovereignty and that is why we have voted against all of the reports on this issue .
I refer to Rule D , Mr Weber .
I also welcome the positive assessment of the proposal of Macedonia &apos;s continued efforts to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened a few hours ago in Greece will not be councious ; on the contrary , I hope that it will mark the start of a unanimous effort in the name of European identity training through solidarity and partnership .
We have been in touch at one time with the people in Tunisia and Egypt , with our delegations , whom I welcome for what they have to face in recent weeks , and also in direct contact with the government and the services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument is of even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis , as it helps the recovery of companies more effectively and can , in future , be a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund .
These inspections were inadequate .
Europe will then be able to make a major contribution , albeit with limits .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman to Parliament following the draft recommendation submitted to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , which concerns the serious delay in the European Ombudsman &apos;s response to the European Ombudsman &apos;s services .
The main progress made by this directive , if we compare it with the existing legislation , is that patients will be able to choose their care-care provider and access information about the quality and safety of the care they will receive .
I reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to provide the necessary mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund flexibly , as well as the review of the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund with a view to adapting to the needs arising from the tragedy .
After consulting consumer rights organisations and representatives of the world of business affairs , I believe that we should insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I have said that those who raise issues are bad about the fake in this debate .
This means that the European Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case , trade negotiations - and to intervene politically by the parliamentary means at its disposal ( hearings , resolutions and also oral questions ) in order to learn about the progress of these negotiations .
There is no recognition of citizens &apos; investment in social cohesion or solidarity between generations .
But the real reform lies in admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights issues in the current European Union .
Adequate financial resources should be made available to enable the opportunities to be used and to exploit new sources of global competitiveness for the EU .
In many countries in Europe , it is well known that when public authorities are in a difficult situation , they usually pay late , often leading to the bankruptcy of some companies .
The G20 conference has also made it possible to decommission tax havens one of its main objectives .
You cannot say the same about the political class .
It is a fact that , in international transactions , the dollar continues to predominate and constitutes a secure investment , but the huge debts accumulated by the United States so that the rest of the world finances its lifestyle will semeer ever more doubt over the capacity that the first economic power in the world will have to honour its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and measures to combat and defeat those who want to destroy it .
To be absolutely clear , Iceland , when it was a rich country , had no interest whatsoever in joining the European Union .
This request is not new , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving everyone to ensure a very high level of local acceptance .
However , it is a problem which will export the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions while fighting in Afghanistan continues .
We must fight this fragmentation , so I urge Commissioner Andor to keep the regulations on the European Social Fund intact and not to disperse it , as has sometimes been suggested in this House .
Of course , by nature , we have not achieved everything we want in a compromise .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets again , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mr Haug , for their constructive attitude throughout the budget procedure , which also shows the very good cooperation that we have enjoyed in this task .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to emphasise that negotiations are not open , which would have enabled more realistic alternatives , as well as a privileged partnership .
It is therefore , above all , an American problem , which must be resolved by Washington .
Let me also mention that we must put in place a reform that will make European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers and create a dynamic of development in the knowledge society .
The restored quota can be maintained in national reserve and distributed at a later stage if the Member States so understand .
For this reason , I ask once again that 25 May , the day of its implementation , be designated the International Day of Heroes of the Fight against Totalitarism , because many people unknown as Pilecki , who have lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , should be remembered .
Allow me to briefly refer to what we have done .
If this were to become the majority in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , we would destroy the peace plan , which was strongly funded , created after the Balkan war .
I hope that all this will encourage greater participation in EMAS , not because it is keen to see a numbers war between EMAS and ISO , but because I believe that the system is good and can help us meet our own sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker agreed to a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I believe it will go well .
Combin dumping should no longer be allowed , nor should the social consequences it entails .

I am aware that during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , the stakeholders in the sheep meat sector defended mandatory origin labelling .
I am well aware of the complexity of this issue , Mr Kelly .
Although most countries are faced with economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to combating the adverse effects of climate change .
I would like to ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will initiate a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system .

It is therefore important to establish a network sharing statistical data and a platform for coordinating research in the areas of the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease among the Member States .
I also share the view expressed by many in this Parliament that the more European solidarity we have the better will be EU-Russia relations .
Syria still has a very long way to go with regard to freedom of expression and association .
Much remains to be done before we can guarantee women equal access to the labour market .
I must , however , reiterate that the proposal must be reassessed in order to take account of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .

in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation experienced by dairy farmers is untenable .
I supported the report because I would like to emphasise , in particular , one of the threats which refers to : the lack of reliable and comprehensive information at our disposal with regard to the properties relating to health , as well as the composition and origin of certain species of fish .
After all , history is filled with examples of interventions by Western countries that have done the best .
Speaking as rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and incapable of dealing with crime prevention for several reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a fundamental political event and , unlike what you said here , Hamas for the first time accepted that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority were their partners in the negotiations .
Countries dispute and negotiate the division of the seabed .
The last area is particularly important , given the problems in terms of energy infrastructure that ...
In other words , it is precisely the institution established to protect us from criminals ( indirectly , by making professional training available for police officers ) ends up in the dock &apos;s seat .
However , the move from Mr Castro to his brother , Raúl , has not led to democratic reforms or the release of political prisoners .
The escalation of energy efficiency in all advertising containing information on energy consumption or advertising that refers to product prices will be revealed .
Colleagues , everyone is aware of the Washington Consensus : you appreciate it very much .
In this way , we could also provide an appropriate response on the ground to the concrete facts , which , in every way , Frontex is already facing .
I would like to conclude by thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs once again , but also the members of the various committees involved for their very constructive and positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this , and I very much welcome the support the Presidency has given to our efforts to find a solution .
In particular , H.G. Gustaf Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the private sector fabric makes the candidate particularly suitable for ensuring the balance between Community law and the specific requirements of both the market and the people of Europe .
So far , this conflict has already claimed 1 000 victims in 17 days .
The number of counterfeit medicines will only be reduced , and their use will only be made safer if such measures are taken .
We must also learn from the Opel case : we still have time to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automotive sector .
We have taken these measures because , like you , President Obama and I reject the false choice between security and our ideals .
The Euro Plus Pact is , unfortunately , proposing to transform wage austerity into a permanent situation .
Recently at Manchester airport , there has been a new attempt , and there is now a legal opinion that the use of these machinery in minors may infringe the legislation on the protection and safety of children because of the image they have produced .
Furthermore , this money does not go directly to artists .
In the area of civil aviation , the development of the system and the use of EGNOS for landing works should be supported .

I am voting in favour of the report establishing a European Microfinance Facility , which will help people at risk of creating or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that some progress has been made in this direction with Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I fully agree with , and I think that this report will enable us to define better the legal framework of the urban agenda and also to introduce some instruments , such as local operational programmes as operational programmes which could give new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , it made clear to me that the improvements that I made on behalf of Parliament are essential if we want to have fair and efficient energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is of the utmost importance that self-employed people be supported and encouraged .
In short , there is no need to ask Brussels for them .
Mr President , for us and for Europe , for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and for us in Europe , of course , energy has become an instrument of foreign policy , an element of exchange that can trigger conflicts or can unite us , and that is precisely what we are dealing with today .
I voted in favour of this report because the food aid programme , the expansion programme of which is being considered a fundamental instrument for helping those people most in need who suffer profoundly from the consequences of the current economic crisis , even in terms of basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States and most emerging countries , have at least a Credit Export Agency ( ECA ) and together the ECA represent the world &apos;s most important source of public funding for private sector projects .
We therefore did not vote in favour of the report .
With this position , we have helped to destroy this joint government .
By setting up in 2003 the French council of Muslim worship , President Sarkozy , then Minister of the Interior , introduced Islam in the French institutions .
In this regard , I have asked the European Commission to know what it thinks and to consider the possibility of launching special programmes that create equal opportunities for women in science .
It is a struggle that we will continue to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and ensure unrestricted access to services for end-users .
The great European politicians and thinkers have realised very well that the strength that could unite Europe was a common approach to economic problems .

Opening of the sitting
I hope that , from this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the strategy in terms of progress in key areas such as promoting civic education , professional orientation and employment .
The costs will be borne by the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to create a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to initiate dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is particularly important for stability in the region .
Therefore , an accident must be foreseen in a reactor every 25 years .
In my view , this increased housing eligibility for the cofinanced expenditure of the ERDF must lead us to consider other possible developments , both in the medium and long term , in terms of the eligibility of funds and their allocation to certain strategic priorities .
Today , the time has come for us to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both countries , this time for Christians .
Climate change : one of the biggest threats facing our planet .
Of course , there has been a great deal of emphasis , as we would have expected , on human rights , on the importance of ensuring that respect for human rights is an integral part of all the dynamic relations that we have and the work we do .
I must also say that for the time being , the EU has no competence in matters of air traffic regulation .
However , Europe is not a love or a cure at a time of economic crisis .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment that the Commission has already made to comitology and optional provisions .
I do not think that any of the fruitless words spoken here today , not even those of the Commission , can change the fact that the European Union does not have any presence in Libya and that it is not even able to stop the crisis in cities or even the actions of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s land troops .
For this reason , I firmly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , it will benefit the citizens of the EU considerably considerably , because its power of choice will be much greater .
Mr President , I share this hope that the European Council will agree on measures that can appease the markets and introduce stability in the euro area once again , because it is in everyone &apos;s interests to both grasp them and not .
Pre-accession funds have proved to be particularly susceptible to fraud .
That is a reason to thank and joy .
We therefore insist that the war and violence of all sides be brought to an end and urge the European Union to take action in this direction .
Outside Europe , the world is looking at the energy challenge very seriously .
Energy efficiency indicators in buildings should be included in the advertisements for sale or leverage advertisements to be published in the media .
It is essential to support efforts aimed at increasing EU investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , at encouraging the generation of alternative and non-conventional forms of energy at local level and at improving infrastructure capacity to facilitate the link to new energy sources .
Infrastructure is the basis for the proper functioning of the internal market , which in turn leads to an increase in internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the possibility of establishing a rapid response mechanism within the ENP to respond quickly and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as was the case recently in the southern neighbourhood .
I find it simply grotesque that there is someone in this Parliament who supports Serbia but condemns the EULEX mission .
What happens then is that the only Members listening to what is said are those who understand the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the emphasis the Swedish Presidency has placed on issues that concern our fellow citizens , our electorate , namely the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because if we want to do a good job , we must be in line with those who voted for us .
The Union budget cannot , as some MEPs claim , be used as a supplement to national budgets at a time of austerity ; on the contrary , it must reflect the difficult situation in which the Member States of the Union find themselves .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the treaty has not given the Council any competence to intervene in the national constitutions of the Member States .
The situation has changed .
You may call me cynical , but students do not always go to study and the tourists do not always go for a limited period of time .
Is the global financial crisis , which has turned into the economic crisis , the cause of this situation , or is we dealing with our own mistakes , negligence and inaction here ?
My second &apos; but &apos; is about the role that the Belgian Presidency has played in the post-Lisbon period .
The main objective of these schemes was to maintain the cohesion of the territory of this huge country , which is inhabited by a multitude of people completely different .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
This already happens a little in many areas with Japan , but I recognise Japan &apos;s right to protect its rice market , to protect its rivers , to pay its farmers higher prices than that of world markets and to say no to mass imports that could destroy their champion , and to recognise our economies the right to protect certain sectors of their activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to talk about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen the social priority , as I have already told Members , when we discuss the broad policy guidelines for the next parliamentary term .
So , Commissioner , I will come straight to the question and ask you what measures - and I use the plural here - the Commission intends to take in the short term to address those shortcomings .
That is precisely what has been lacking so far or has not been made visible enough to our citizens .
It is not in the interests of the citizens , and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m. )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal by adopting with a very large majority the report by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania supports the open-door policy , which is aimed especially at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that , beyond this , everything must be done to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I am also expressly referring to accidents of work , which occur quite often , but also to dangerous substances used in labour processes .
In September 2009 , the Council started the in-depth study of the proposal to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund .
It is important at the moment to take special consideration for island and peripheral regions , which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , are now faced with the devastation of infrastructure and personal goods , trade and agricultural goods , and in many cases , the resumption of normal activities is not immediate , especially for regions which depend almost exclusively on tourism , because mediating potential disvisitors may be diverted .
We have not seen such a sustained upheaval in the sector , with such great financial losses since 11 September and , despite the financial difficulties that we are currently facing , I would urge all Member States to support plans to help a sector which simply cannot bear any further damage .
On the other hand , we must admit that our level of exposure is also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is horrific .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a little linguistic and perhaps semântic remark .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
We can want something to happen - we can very much want it to happen - but we need to see the reality .
Consumer organisations are in favour of binding measures for a collective redress system in all Member States in conjunction with other options , such as the extension of existing alternative dispute settlement mechanisms ( ARs ) to mass disputes .
The problem is not Turkish Cypriots , as some have said .
I would like to ask the Commission what it wants to do to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin without having to be subjected to long and fatist journeys to the countries where they are consumed .
That is what we have to do .
I sincerely wonder , ladies and gentlemen , how the human rights defenders are happy , like us , for the West to be secular and pluralist and , shamefully , distracted from looking at a Middle East that is slowly becoming reserved for a single religion .
This is being done and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , while it is true that bankers who squander our money are contemptible , Mr Schulz , it is also true that the politicians who are now pooling their deficits and debts at the expense of the younger generations are irresponsible .
I must therefore extend my thanks to the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs of the various parliamentary groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to do their part .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights was good ; in fact , the relationship was very cooperative .
We must strive to ensure that the proposed programmes support as much as possible the reforms being made by these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that each Member State maintains national contact points in order to provide all the necessary information to patients , including on the availability of healthcare , procedures and documentation required .
In the past , we could see any events in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , but now we have discussed trade in conditions of absolute individual freedom .
Regardless of whether this is going to become a private or public fund , the report deals with a very concrete issue , namely that Parliament must determine , firstly , that there is no legal justification for subsidising the deficits of that fund and , secondly , that we will never grant deficits .
Certainly their faces are the most expensive ones since Helna de Trojador who has made a thousand ships at sea .
The aid that distorts competition endangers the future of the European automotive industry and will have negative consequences both for employment and for technical progress .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a few things that I think we should bear in mind in the debate that is starting .
You have heard from several Member States that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse majority mechanism .
( FR ) Having said all this , I think it is very important that we do not forget the issues that are really at stake here .
( The speaker agreed to take a question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To show our solidarity with the campaign to arrest this barbaric ritual , I encourage you all to use a rose-talin of today to symbolise our opposition to this practice .
Democratic control is being avoided , because national governments are apologising to the Commission and the Troika when they take the most elementary measures , and the Commission , in turn , is referring to these matters for national governments .
Investment in future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
Following threats from the Commission to conduct actions in the Court of Justice , Sweden has now started to allow the use of the paint BDE .
It is clear to those of us who belong to rural constituencies and to those who are part of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the current situation in many of the livestock sector &apos;s producers is simply unsustainable .
Savers deserve transparent , easy information to understand and accessible information .
I think we could take the task of supporting the Chinese people in the realisation of a harmonious society .
During the vote , I supported these two mechanisms , because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus safeguard our future .
It is also important for the organisers of initiatives - social organisations or non-governmental organisations - to clearly and explicitly specify their object and objective , even though they do not necessarily have to table a proposal for legislation .
There is a city in Latvia , Daugavpils , where more than 90 % of the inhabitants are Russian speakers .
I would like to welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apologies and the recent motion for a resolution by the Czech Government , requiring the health Ministry to take a number of measures to ensure that such violations do not happen again by 31 December 2009 .
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
Now the effects of globalisation have been totally overcome by the economic and financial crisis and our calculated reaction is adjusting the criteria for financing the EGF .
This resolution notes Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 , which was recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to cooperate in their common approach towards Kosovo , with a view to Kosovo &apos;s accession to the EU .
In comparison with any of the other institutions , it can still be considered that Parliament is at the forefront of transparency , and so I would not make this matter my priority , as this House is more open than any national parliament in terms of the accessibility of documents and the transparency of meetings and activities of its members .
It was a question raised by the Minister for Italian Reform , Umberto Bossi , for the purposes of internal politics .
The alerts launched by the Human Rights Centre in the Asturias - my region - and other organisations deserve to be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution relating to the ban on thrombin and pig .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and will be closely following the ongoing research .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data is not sufficient to determine which measures should be used to disciplin Member States with the greatest index of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
Most importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS .
On the second issue , I can assure Members that the Commission is aware that the control of AMR requires a multi-disciplinary approach .
Yesterday &apos;s trialogue gives us great hope that a final agreement will be reached .
The estimates , based on an annual growth rate of around 27 % in the coming years , point to a figure of EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
I believe , however , that the legal basis for the proposal should be adapted so that the act has the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many people ask me about what ACTA represents , and it was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report as EU financial assistance will help people who are victims of globalisation to find employment and return to the labour market , helping them to escape from the recession .
Given that the Internet is the main tool for creating better conditions for development and knowledge for citizens , particularly through the dissemination of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and the creation of software for development and innovation .
All this is added to the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and about the problems that vary from the admission of a country which shares borders with more than 80 million people : factors which will continue to sustain my unwavering belief in the failure of Turkey &apos;s accession to a Europe whose unity depends , above all , on the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This means going against the environment and consumer safety , because old equipment , with high energy consumption and potentially dangerous could be put back on the market .
Thank you for your attention , and I look forward to the debate .
I would like to record my gratitude to the President of the House of Balindam , Dr Reitemann , and to the local council for authorising the memorial in honour of the lives of these young people .
Thirdly , I urge Commissioner Kroes to speed up digitisation in the Member States so that we can be proud of this major flagship project in the future .
Anyone who has witnessed and testified to the results of the environmental disaster caused by the technological failure in Baia Mare , and subsequently the release of toxic noise for water courses , with a long range effect on the fauna of the Tisza in Hungary , as well as the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything possible to ensure that nothing similar can ever be repeated in the European Union .
This is a joint responsibility : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and properties : the fundamental freedom of movement , as the Commissioner said , and to cross dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when it proposes rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we had the courage to convene the summit , that we have convened the social partners , that we will prepare it in advance with them - before the employment summit , in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we are trying to draw conclusions which will be important to the June Council .
In particular , the European Parliament established at first reading a good basis for the proper application of the rules on cross-border healthcare provision in the Member States , so that patients can , where appropriate , and in accordance with the rules laid down and without overloading the courts , receive the ambulatory or hospital care they need in another Member State .

in writing . - ( SV ) We have again decided to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to support a total of 1200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering the effects of the economic crisis and exceptional times require exceptional measures .

The very fact that they are participating in a joint process of mitigating the global imbalance and , for example , in financial regulation , should be acknowledged : a huge step forward that would simply not have been possible a few years ago , and therefore the Seoul Summit was another important step in this process and in launching a new agenda , not just a spectacular event .
The resolution that I and my group have supported with our vote contains some of these things , but I think that Mr Barroso , the Council and Parliament should be bolder .
I am also pleased that the Commission accepted many of the concerns expressed by this Parliament when we rejected the interim agreement , which we considered inadequate .
