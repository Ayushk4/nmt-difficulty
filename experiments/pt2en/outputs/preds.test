Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that research and innovation are not an option for Europe but a necessity if we want a long-term solution to protect our social model and the sustainability of our environment.

In these circumstances, if, on all sides of this House, we are prepared to take action to defend what we call the democratic values of the European Union, then we must make a solemn warning and, Commissioner, we must implement European law, as you yourself have done, and we must say together with thousands of intellectuals, creators and Italian journalists, that the freedom to inform the entire European Union of the freedom to provide information throughout Italy.

It is a clear contradiction to mention the Copenhagen criteria, to mention another type of legislation and, at the same time, perhaps - when there is not enough courage or enough courage - to use the lack of competence as I say, not to go ahead with the protection of minorities, because this is, after all, a dilemma.
Many of these irregularities are detected and/or reported belatedly, jeopardising the protection of taxpayers' money.
The Swedish Presidency and the Commission are congratulated on the work they have done in activating the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection.

Can I ask you, Madam President, to send a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency, as well as to the next Swedish Presidency, to open a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible?

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that, after four years, we have not yet seen a Commission proposal on how we can improve animal transport legislation.
This report is the result of a compromise, since nothing more has been tabled, no less than 1 625 amendments to it, and it is divided into a series of key points covering the causes of the crisis, from the property bubble to unguaranteed banking products, a lack of tax harmonisation at European level and a breach of the Stability and Growth Pact.

Shahbaz Bhatti, Minister of the government of Pakistan, Salman Taser, Governor of the province of Punjab and Sabir Jamaldini, coordinator of the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan, are for us innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law.
I would like to use language that also reflects what the European Union has to be positive, because even more surprising that may seem to be the case, the truth is that in recent times, too, good things have happened.
It is an important step in supporting families with children, enabling them to reduce unfair tax burdens.
We should welcome them with enthusiasm rather than with mosques.

We are talking about an ambiguous speech in which EU control distorts the principles of the issue.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by this debate by fellow Members, who, on the one hand, speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but on the other hand, when it comes to taking the first step with regard to micro-enterprises - and it is exclusively these that we are talking about today and not about any other - are already tempted to say'no' once again.
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to support the management of this waste in order to eliminate its hazards and the adoption of more demanding regulators to prevent the violation of this directive.

Instead, we need a completely correct application of the existing regulations and I think that their comments on navigation, etc. are a positive contribution to this debate.
In another place, it regrets the fact that Europe has an ageing population.
I believe that we, as Parliament, must seek more dynamic decisions in response to the problems faced by Europe, without ever forgetting about transparency in the management of funds.
It is also completely absurd and unacceptable that Members, behind closed doors, are obliged to ask the Commission to inform them of the content of the agreements on which we should vote.

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Presedo, on behalf of the socialists, and Mrs Bowles, for their successful work with me on the compromise text presented today as a report on the Commission's White Paper.
(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the level of interest in this debate with the questioners is visible from the fact that neither one of them is in the Chamber, so they will not have heard what Mrs Vaidere has just said - that real visa policy in Russia was a weapon used by that country not to foster the naturalisation process in Latvia but to achieve precisely the opposite.
However, I believe that the work we do allows us to be optimistic.
I think that the EU should study this possibility during the dialogue to be initiated soon by the High Representative.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, thousands of children suffer from child traffickers and, even more so, are being abducted.
Good governance and EU regional policy (
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability, for example.
This kind of cooperation greatly simplifies the life of a rapporteur.
Therefore, from a political point of view, it is absolutely crucial that we vote on this proposal, and it goes back to Mrs Wallis - and indeed part of the House - is not at all justified, given the debates that we have held.
Moreover, this is supported both by the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss Institute of Comparame Law and by the 2009 report, drafted by Mr Schaldemose and adopted by Parliament.

(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the package to be voted on tomorrow would be nothing without the will of the European Parliament and I take this opportunity to welcome the work carried out.

I think there is one positive point to make: we are all interested in research and we all know that it is the only hope of the EU and the Member States.
I would like to say that it was a mistake for the Presidency not to unequivocally condemn the article published in the Swedish newspaper.
Measures need to be taken to halt late payment in commercial transactions to defend the good health of the European economy, to avoid situations of financial ascertaining structures of productive structures and to burden the use of funding products that increase dependency on the banking sector.
It is absurd to encourage imports of products that do not even meet the quality criteria imposed on our farmers.
To conclude, we have enormous challenges ahead of us to ensure unity at European level, to involve strategically external partners, and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate measures, but there are many lessons to be learnt from COP 15.
Such an approach should therefore be based on real problems, to ask relevant questions and to focus on specific measures that add value to people's everyday lives.
Oral questions and written declarations (submission): see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his very constructive attitude.

At the very least, the work of all mothers must be considered for the purposes of contributing pensions.
Any new balicious and unfounded political attacks will be redundant.
In this regard, Europe's approach could be'yes', of course we need external supply, we need security of supply and major innovative projects such as Desertec, but we must also ensure that citizens, businesses and households, can have greater control over their energy budgets and their energy consumption in terms of price, economy and the environment'.
For these reasons, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the proposals calling for an environmental impact study and will vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Sturdy - which I myself have signed - relating to endocrine disruptors, as well as those which support the provision of plant protection products in the event of an emergency.
It is scandalous that it is always the same working countries that pay for the mistakes of others.
Europe has been involved in the region for some time: EUR 300 million per year in Afghanistan, the EUPOL mission, which is undertaking extremely valuable action despite its personnel problems, the international observation mission and, of course, the involvement of the different ISAF states.
That is one thing.
Another measure is needed is for India to establish and apply clear and transparent public procurement regulations, which will also help European companies to be able to access them.
Thus, with an adequate impact assessment and the formulation of the different legal alternatives, as well as a clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure, long-term strategic projects for building a stronger EU will be easier to achieve.
Part of this is the ratification of the new START Treaty, which is still pending in the United States Congress.

We need an alternative plan, as has already been rightly mentioned, and the railway system is the alternative.
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional EUR 3 million budget for 2008 for the reconstruction of cultural heritage in the areas affected by the war in the Western Balkans.
Furthermore, the Member States are obliged to ensure that no return operations are carried out in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which imposes on them to ensure that no one will be sent back to their country runs the risk of being persecuted or suffering serious attacks once they have been returned.
It will make it more effective than if it were an opt-out situation, enabling the various funds to operate separately.
In order to legislate at EU level, it is absolutely imperative to be aware of the extreme vulnerability women and children experience in the face of domestic violence.

Ireland has decided to hold a second referendum.
I welcome the initiative of the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, to call on the European Union to recognise the official genocide committed by the Nazis and his allies against the Roma population during World War II because it marks a step forward in the fight to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe.

I would like to highlight one of the Commission's paragraphs in the draft statement annex to the proposal.

Mrs Ronzulli, I ask you to sit down and stop talking.
It is an important fact which shows the will and ability of Parliament to propose itself as a candidate for playing a central role in the CFSP/CSDP, based on what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon.
For this reason, I support this report in general, provided that the Member States maintain a leading role in the management, designation and protection of wilderness.
Above all, after a long day of many months, I take away with me the desire of this House to see the service gain life, to meet the needs of the voters that you represent and to serve them well.
The debate is closed.
This and other issues could have been dealt with at the summit.
Georgia's territorial integrity must remain out of the question.
So, as you can see, we are almost at the same level.
Therefore, this debate is important to remind you that this year, in 2009, the Commission made a commitment to present this Parliament with a communication aimed at assessing possible threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information at European level, and to draw attention to the importance of a directive guaranteeing pluralism of information, taking into account new technologies and, in particular, television.

If we were in the former Romanian senate, surely a senator would get up with his toolbox and look at President Trichet, would say:'How dare you dare to abuse and Trichete, trichete, a notes?' - how long are you going to continue to prove our patience, Mr Trichet?
Finally, Mr President, if you will allow me, in order to remove any suspicion that may exist, I would like to propose that a European Parliament enquiry committee be established on this issue.
The service concessions have been deliberately eliminated from the procurement directives in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take into account cultural differences.

I therefore congratulate Mill√°n Mon on his brilliant report, which is now at an optimum time for strengthening relations between the two continents.
That is why we move forward with an important simplification of EU legislation.
Unfortunately, important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected and, as a result, initiatives cannot be signed by residents of the EU who are not nationals of a Member State, thereby preventing the equal participation of residents, regardless of nationality, and there is no guarantee that signatures will meet the numbers of signatories.
I call for the creation of an independent committee formed by local and international legal experts to conduct investigations and prosecute the violent events following the problematic elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan.
All of this has gone too far and it must finish.
The drafting of a guide for public and private operators and the creation of a system of training and mobility on how to implement multi-level governance policies in practice could be effective measures aimed at improving regional policy.

Mr President, the ongoing negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam should also include respect for human rights and civil liberties.

While the construction of an area of security, justice and freedom within the European Union is an imperative for all of us, and undoubtedly also a model of European democracy to be built, and many of us believe that Europol represents an instrument that can be adapted to it, all of us defend that the placing in common of the means - namely, of human rights, but especially of technical means, which is to combat organised crime and all kinds of European security - with the greatest rigour of European citizens' rights.
It is therefore essential for measures to be adopted which can enhance guarantees of independence and transparency in impact assessments, and this will contribute to the fact that this instrument can play its full part in helping the process of political decision making and ensure the quality and adequacy of the activities of the Community institutions.
Secondly, the strategy must strengthen the internal cohesion of the EU, in other words its convergence.
It is not, I might add, the direction in which the Commission was taking, as the Commission's proposal focused - through the regulation that this House adopted - on reform of the current system of agencies, which are private, and on the very strict consolidation of transparency requirements to avoid conflicts of interest, honesty of credit rating.
The European Commission is also called on to assess the costs and benefits of establishing a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.

The EU and the industrialised nations should adopt a target of a reduction of between 25% and 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and, in the long term, should aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels.
Report: Maria in C√©u Patr√£o Neves
I would like to refer more specifically to two outstanding issues which were referred to several times during the debate.
First of all, and on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and spirit of compromise that have enabled us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers, especially with regard to disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility.

Earlier at the beginning of this period, the subject of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy is an important point.

The Irish people, with their very strong vote, are looking forward to continuing to thrive and build a strong Europe and, above all, a federal Europe.
Although the protection of the environment and the safeguarding of public health are inseparable, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
It is a bravery that we should resolve together.
We need to combine our efforts with the major consumer countries, such as the US, China, Russia and Japan, to tackle this problem and create a global alert system and registering of illegal holdings and countries which raise concern, using Interpol, a suitable UN body, with the support of the most advanced satellite detection systems.
Of course, we cannot allow short-term support for the industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness.
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
in writing. - (PT) The fight against unemployment and social exclusion has been given special attention by citizens and the European institutions, due to the effects of the current economic and social crisis.

We regret the rate of abstention in the European elections and vote'no' in referendums.
We have to ask what is happening and we will inform you, Mr Coelho.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements are regulated by a variety of regulations, but omissions in legislative, intentional or non-, provisions can lead to the elimination of competition.

The same horror as Picasso painted in his Guernica, representing our village from Guernica razed by the Junkers of Condor Legion seven decades ago.

The Rapkay report on the amendment of the Staff Regulations of the European Community in the context of the installation of the European External Action Service, the EEAS, is a document of great relevance in the creation of a Union foreign policy.

We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that its independence has not been recognised by Spain or by four other EU Member States.

It is a very important approach to the real humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I would also like to support what my fellow Members have said about the rights of disabled passengers, what Mrs Kadenbach said about minors, about the reference to the issue of fire security, specifically about the safety of the aspersion system in all EU hotels and the need for a new proposal to follow.
I was also going to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission and would therefore take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Ashton on her appointment.
The report makes it clear that national defence and security are areas of the exclusive authority of the Member States, which we consider important to emphasise.
Previously, the Member States most concerned about asset stripping and illegal purchases were those with no lower threshold of disclosure of participations and no disclosure of gainful contracts.
I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen Agreement contains references to the level of ambition that will be required to combat climate change in the climate change agreement post-2012 and lays the basis for a financial package, and calls for serious commitments to be made with regard to reducing emissions.
Knowing, malaria and tuberculosis still clash around four million lives per year.
From a more strictly commercial point of view, I would like to ask the Commissioner for assurances that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to prevent the trade in medicines that are accessible at more competitive prices; safe medicines, generic medicines that do not violate copyright and whose only crime is that of being produced by emerging countries such as India and Brazil and that may disrupt Western pharmaceutical industries.
Nevertheless, Members have the right to say a word.
This is unacceptable!

A very clear distinction must be maintained between the powers of the military authorities and those of the humanitarian bodies, and dialogue between them is needed in order to promote mutual understanding.

Farmers in my part of the world feel completely abandoned and frankly insulted by the fact that some Members assume that they do not know what they do and that they need to be taught.

Therefore, the report on the European Refugee Fund, advocating, as it does, the resettlement of refugees in the European Union, is quite incomprehensible.

Economists use mathematic models to highlight the value of domestic work.
Only when we are fully informed about such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law.
I repeat: from all means.
It is also particularly urgent on the eve of the Copenhagen conference that both the EU and the other international players combine their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development.
I would like to make a reference to Commissioner Rehn's statement, for whom I have a personal regard, which said that Nigeria is a very poor country: that is not true - Nigeria is a very rich country that is the victim of a corrupt and inept class that has squandered the country's resources, leaving millions of citizens in poverty.
Finally, Mr M√∂lzer, not so pessimistic, is what I want to say to you.
I therefore call on the Council to express its opinion without delay on Parliament's new proposal so that ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 and I call on the Commission to ensure mutual respect for the social and environmental requirements of the producing and exporting countries outside the ACP region.
This requires the Commission - as coordinator of the Energy Community - to take Ukraine in arms and to remind you of its obligations when security of Europe's supply is at stake.
We regret, of course, the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes, regardless of whether atrocities are committed in Europe or, for example, in the former European colonies.
The main objective of the regulation must be to create a new collective monitoring and responsibility culture, rather than to impose a bureaucratic and onerous process on each product.
Member of the Commission. - The current EU competition policy for vertical agreements is quite favourable to Internet sales, and I am sure you know that, Mr President.
In contrast, the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third of the mistake, and they are going in the right direction.
In the area of transport, far more efforts will be needed to impose restrictions on vehicle manufacturers to bring cars with a more efficient fuel consumption.
The financial situation in some eurozone countries, which has been analysed today, clearly shows the risks of removal from the Stability and Growth Pact agreements.

In the Commission and Parliament we deliberately chose not to raise the issue of the process of funding, because we are assuming that the sector will keep its promise to address this issue of free and spontaneous freedom without legislative pressure.
This brings me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, as regards the processing industry, I should remind the House that Pakistan is the world's fourth cotton producer, with 9% of global production, followed by the European Union, with a little less than 5.5%.
Therefore, the Council and, above all, this Parliament are also involved in the decision on the College's composition, the portfolios that I have redistributed and the programme you have presented for the next five years.
We have to understand that things have only been working for a year and that the pace should speed up in 2009.

The 2010 budget establishes this systematic approach.
According to the report of the UN Working Group, the victims of trafficking come from different social contexts, the wealthiest of the poorest, the most educated in academic terms to completely ancient women, from children to older women.

I think that mutual recognition of medical revenue among Member States is very important because this is not only about healthcare, it is also about rehabilitation, but we have a time when it is possible to finalise that detail.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports, which raise important issues regarding the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to the achievement of some of the key objectives of public policies: respect for human rights, the pursuit of economic welfare and social justice, the pursuit of sustainable growth and respect for the environment and, in particular, for the climate system.

Everyone seems to forget the contribution made by the United States and, of course, NATO, to peace in Europe.
I think we should consider this as an appropriate opportunity to address something that Europe urgently needs: economic growth, jobs, a sector of dynamic businesses, more innovation, more efficient public procurement; it is on the basis of these things that our citizens will judge.
I think it is not our job to make predictions about the possible developments in those countries.
The second draft involves concessions.
Madam President, Ireland adopted a ban on smoking in the workplace during the European elections in 2004, so we met many sister-rich constituents behind the back door.

Once again, I call on the Commission to continue to push for this promise to be kept until it is contained in Congo's legislation in its contacts with the government.

I believe that this procedure will not only strengthen the food security of EU citizens, but also bring greater clarity for the Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.

Therefore, as agreed with the Council, the following text should be added at the end of Article 1 (4) of the original version of the regulation, pursuant to Article 1 (2) (b) of this regulation:'Every time the charges are referred to in other currencies of non-euro, the annual review of the tariffs regulated by Articles 4 (a), 4 (a) (a) (b) (a) (a) (a) exchange rate) will be carried out by the same toolbox 3).

Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two main instruments adopted by the Council of Europe.

Madam President, our questions have been asked in order to highlight the benefits our citizens will be able to expect from this package of measures and what we can offer within it.
I voted in favour of the report because it also introduces some substantial improvements to the text of the European Commission, particularly with regard to the protection of personal data.
In addition, we have carried out a review of unused funds from 2009, which indicates that a total of EUR 1.9 billion can be activated for energy and EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for your very clear message.
We also see a little of this in the text and an attempt to take the holistic approach, an aspect that was not exactly how we imagine, but which nevertheless goes in the right direction.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a little tougher, and the Council, where we tried to find reasonable solutions in night sessions and in multiple trialogue sessions, because they also approved the reasonable compromise that we reached a moment ago.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, established a European Crisis Coordination Centre in Aviation, following the meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010.

With my vote in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I am clearly expressing my full support for the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution that they have initiated.

The issue I raise concerns Pakistan, whose chronic instability, as we all know, is a factor in crisis for the whole region and also for Afghanistan.

Last week in committee, I deployed the Belgian Presidency as a ghost presidency.

One thing is to establish such a mechanism and another one is that it must be accessible and comprehensible for EU citizens so that they can use it in full.

Having said this, a positive note: some of the agreements that we have concluded in recent times are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
This is why it is important that the European Parliament once again remind the Commission of the issue of the social clause, which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also hope that Belgrade understands that its current approach towards constructive work with the European Union is by far more effective than ever trying to rewrite history.
However ridiculous the European Commission may seem to be unable to find the necessary arguments so far, nor has it taken the time to influence the Latvian Government on ending discrimination on the basis of language.

The main objective of'Trade Assistance' is to boost the internal and international competitiveness of the 48 states.
Even by accepting the rationality of internalisation of external costs as a valid starting point, it is untenable that, with the aim of mitigating transit congestion, only heavy goods vehicles and not light vehicles, as well as the old'polluter pays' principle being punished in a clearly discriminatory way.
The understanding and support expressed in this debate are an incentive for me.
Furthermore, when we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.

There are large traders with a strong market presence in some Member States and there are also small traders who are more satisfied with what we are currently proposing than the conditions in force since 2002, as they have seen that certain aspects, not provided for by the legislator in 2002, do not defend their interests, but rather difficult to face up to competition from large traders.
It must build the European Union's' regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which the Committee on Development launched by adopting its report in April 2007.

There is a completely incomprehensible law which says that the priests, shops and Orthodox patriarchy must be Turkish citizens.
The most relevant points in this Parliament's position are to draw attention to the spread of measures that may suffer from inconsistency, not only as a legislative body, but above all in the area of implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured that the European Union has joined the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

Year after year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us the satisfaction that the European Union budget is spent regularly and in compliance with the law; indeed, the lack of control over taxpayers' money was a major cause for concern to me when I led the European Commission's accounting service in 2002.
For me, this is both a huge challenge and a great honour.

Furthermore, it adds new points to what Parliament has already said in the past, namely, it asks the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations carried out by all parties, informing Parliament of the fact that the responsibility and credibility of the European Union and its Member States demand monitoring of the investigations, and express concern for the pressure carried out by the NGOs involved in the subsequent investigations into the Goldstone report and the report.
I also hope that this decision will help to rescue endangered species.
I hope that I regard my questions as not as a provocation, but as a help for reflection.
I am always prepared - and, I hope, ready to return here and explain the results that we have achieved, but we must check all the data found.

We will soon have a TEN-T meeting, in which the Commission will move towards the development of a network in other modes of transport.

The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 establishing specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union - C7-0255/2009 -.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for the statements they have made today.

I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which extends its scope to housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities in all Member States.
It is also a way of remembering policy makers in their area of competence that, in order to have real freedom of the press, public authorities must play a role: they must be ready to protect freedom of speech and promote their development.
Mr President, I think that the European Union has become too great, has too many cultures and I simply do not have anything faith in this system; it is going to be worse still.
