Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 summit in London will be a branch of a global crisis resolution .
On Wednesday , the conclusions of the report under discussion highlight the fact that the importation of agricultural products from outside the EU is much more damaging to the environment than internal production , which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing CO2 emissions , which is why imports contribute to climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that the countries to which these funds are given cannot use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
Member States &apos; maritime transport institutions must cooperate more closely to harmonise education programmes and provide opportunities for paid work experience and exchange with European maritime transport companies .
Τhe next item is the Commission statement on the impact of storm Xynthia in Europe .
We see that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened , and the EU must also force the Member States &apos; authorities to take their responsibilities .
I would like to add one point that no one , with the exception of Commissioner Almunia , has so far discussed .
The sectors affected by the impact of climate change are mainly as follows : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry , biodiversity and , last but not least , the health of the population .
In addition , on behalf of the Commission , I want to make a contribution to the death of nine Turkish soldiers and police soldiers in the terrorist attacks of last week .
I would like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for all his work .
However , it is comfortable that , as members of the Committee on Culture and Education were opposed and worried about cuts in education policies at a time when unemployment is increasing and there are problems in many Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments - which I supported - and added the amount initially planned for the budget ( for example , in relation to item 15 02 02 ) .
The minority government , which represents a completely different political tendency , then came to power , but nobody regarded it as a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we - the international community - only looked to the sidelines when the Abyei question was not settled in a referendum is , in fact , completely irresponsible and gives substance to a new war that will subsequently break out .
The case of Marian Cozman , who has been cruelly killing two members of the Hungarian community , demonstrates to us once again that the crime does not know the borders and that disregard for the problems of this community does not result in good .
We need a sound food policy in Europe .
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent the new European political model , insofar as it is about the need to integrate Member States &apos; resources in order to achieve the best possible results and the need to develop common strategies and missions that make the EU the political union that its founding fathers dreamed about years ago .
This is the request that we make .
We are all in favour of the internal market , as Hungary has done from the outset .
Undistorted climate change forces the economy of society and the European Union to adapt to a new reality .
Individual countries continue to contribute to internal stability and help find both socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
This has been a fantastic three-year love and , as in the case of most short-term loving relations , I am pleased to see it coming to an end .
The need for ΝΑΤΟ to maintain continuous controls and receive support , especially in Afghanistan at the moment , is necessary .
However , something needs to be done , because we need to move on .
In this context , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , derogations from the system , the possibility of setting a maximum rate and , in particular , a tax base for intra-EU donations .
I have a few points to make from the West Midlands : we have very high youth unemployment , and our car industry was destroyed , partly due to the fact that the EU funded jobs in Slovakia and made important jobs from the Ryton plant .
It is important to ensure that institutions that initiative are not forced to weaken or undermine the key rules of financial reform .
Enough is enough .
It is also necessary to facilitate the creation of a network of research institutes so that facilities can share specific infrastructure and exchange useful information .
Qimonda fulfils the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
in writing . - Mr President , I warmly support the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office , as the situation in third countries , particularly Africa and the Middle East , is becoming increasingly worse .
Mr Severin rightly pointed out the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs strong America and the United States of America for a strong Europe .
I would therefore ask the Council to tell us what this influx of refugees means from the point of view of how much of them can be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do everything they can to lift these visa requirements .
In this case , neither the food inspector nor the EU Food Safety Agency nor the company itself found the problem .
Belarus ( debate )
We could take advantage of it when dealing with the new agenda , which was raised in Munich , even though it had already been in place in the past , and President Obama &apos;s policy will enable these new disarmament negotiations to be opened .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure this evening to present a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been complete for some time in the Committee on Budgets .
In September , members of the Democratic Union did not vote in favour of appointing the Barroso Commission , because his record was not such that they had given rise to his re-election .
By reforming our agricultural policy , we can ensure that the focus is on animal welfare , that animals live in a type of download and are strong and healthy , in principle , that it is better to prevent than to do it .
We are now afraid that , if this directive is extended , the directive will find itself precisely the same fate as the previous company introducing &apos; Made in &apos; country of origin marking , in other words , the Council will freeze the matter again .
( SL ) Madam President , like my fellow Members , I would like to propose that politicians , Member States and the European Union place SMEs at the heart of their economic recovery efforts .
Countries such as Britain and the United States , which exceed 10 % of their deficits , have to make significant adjustments in order to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep things separate , or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , and I do not think that is within his remit .
There is also clearly no freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Similarly , it is an insult , in particular , to the wine-growers applying Provence policy , to the final product confusing the legalisation of manufactured by-product and permitting a misleading reference to rosé wine .
But there is also a huge amount of work to be done .
This will result in job losses across Europe &apos;s rural areas and a reduction in the capacity to produce their own food .
Let us also remember that , despite these institutional issues , the Swedish Presidency - and this autumn of course - has contributed very much to the need to make progress with regard to climate change , the need to make progress with regard to the financial crisis , Europe &apos;s concern that measures are needed to create jobs - a lot of important issues that need to be addressed .
However , I would like to stress that we are all very aware of the need for a new basis for a number of texts for police and judicial cooperation , allowing Parliament to perform its role as colegislator .
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for leaving out the ethical aspects which , of course , fall within the competence of the Member States .
This is good , because it is young people who will decide the future of Europe in the end but , on the other hand , we should remember those who have already made a significant contribution to Europe &apos;s construction .
In other words , we are planning an economic recovery plan where we are allocating three and a half billion euro-oligarchy , but not a single euro for the partners we need help to promote green energy .
The quotas and management of fish stocks are important in order to prevent the total overfishing of inland waterways and oceans .
We would have preferred to see Parliament &apos;s resources increased by means of redistribution and greater efficiency , rather than by means of an increase in the overall budget .
This package could also show that the European institutions are able to cooperate in a responsible , effective and constructive way in such an important area .
I believe that , in its proposal for recasting the Commission , we can achieve real economies of scale in the medium term through a front-loading approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and have managed to reach an agreement on the by-products regulation at first reading .
We do not want to screen European jobs in countries where we do not have as high environmental standards as we do .
All the contributions were helpful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly getting worse .
They need to work hard to achieve a consensus among the 27 Member States , to bring an end to the crisis of European unity and willingness and to European integration at the heart .
Mr President , I speak as Vice-President of the Commission on Human Rights and Democracy and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the sectors of the economy with the greatest potential for development .
At the time , the funds were only used for two types of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage projects and wind turbulence at the North Sea .
If it had been suggested that money from the EGF should be allocated to workers made redundant in the UK , we would have voted in favour of the allocation of money and we would have been criticised if we had not done so .
As far as the Court is concerned , we know that it is functioning to the full , but it is still in childhood .
It concerns our neighbours , including our closest neighbours such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as wider neighbours such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I and my fellow Members are very committed to including gender mainstreaming in all the policies that we are going to propose .
These projects will help eliminate differences between the European Union &apos;s systems and enable the best possible use to be made of the energy sources of the European Union &apos;s own .
In addition , this approach is based on politics ; I believe that more political action is needed in Europe , above all , and this is certainly one of the responsibilities of our Parliament .
In addition , it is about the fact that the FIFA did not introduce paint sports technology when it was adopted in other sports laws .
In spite of everything , we can organise a variety of training or workshops in which we can provide real help in accessing EU funding for the development of rural areas .
Some other Member States use such a policy as an excuse to justify justifying bilateral agreements with journalists , who often do not care about conditions of transparency and fair competition , not to mention EU solidarity .
I also welcome the fact that we have managed to strengthen cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in legislative planning .
Many Member States in particular have made significant efforts to meet their obligations under the agreement .
The aim is for the EU to be able to respond to the major social challenges faced by all Member States , to which they are unable to cope alone ( ageing and health , energy , water and food supply , sustainable development , the fight against climate change , and to develop expertise enabling European businesses to innovate more and strengthen their competitiveness .
Although we will be supporting this resolution tomorrow , I will find some inconsistencies in the budget and will highlight two of the most important ones .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much to Mr Csibi for his very good work .
We are making progress on global economic governance , in particular with regard to financial regulation and the timely follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to look at this issue in some more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to help them reintegrate into the labour market .
The background is to the European hope that they will no longer have to accept the consequences of this accession inevitably .
It is an ungrateful and difficult task .
This is at the top of our priorities .
However , EU aid is vital for ensuring the country &apos;s independence .
The Israeli Government will continue to force the settlements to build after the war crimes have been committed at the beginning of this year .
The evaluation and further visits from expert groups have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal will continue to obtain permission for five surface long-liners , as in the past .
Increasing budgets in these areas and creating new military capacity leads to a new race ;
I would also like to highlight the conflict that arises between the commitment of the government of Pakistan to freedom of religion and its leading role in the Organisation of Islamic States , which supports its &apos; programme to combat religious degradation &apos; in the United Nations .
I have this comment to make here this afternoon , because it is my honest opinion .
I think the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , as it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , the rapid , coordinated action taken by European governments and European institutions is absolutely necessary , such as the introduction of repatriation programmes for old cars against the considerable rebate of the new car procurement , financial support , etc .
The legal basis proposed is , in my opinion , correct , but it does not appear to be very consistent , given the importance of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which is now strengthening the tasks and powers shared between the two pillars .
Mr President , &apos; success or failure &apos; is what it is all about &apos; .
Such a policy will certainly fail if the people who work in the fisheries sector , the fishermen , are fish for the tradesmen who sell consumers , do not comply with the rules .
This Parliament , which generates this costly , useless and mere debate , pretends to be a skilful illusion of a responsible democracy , is therefore appalling fraud against the voters who sent us here .
That is unfortunate , because it seems that we should agree on this issue .
We are no longer saying that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change are destroying 100 % of industry in Europe , where we are , in a way , not concerned about it , because the climate issue has to be given priority .
The burden of responsibility - whose painful existence we are witnessing - is along the road to economic growth , both in European countries and in the United States .
Furthermore , the report will help clarify and handle various air agreements in a simpler way , indicating which criteria should be taken into account and what aspects should be monitored .
I will be voting in favour of the telecoms package , but I will do so reluctantly , because I believe that the basic principle of liberalising the telecommunications market has been substantially infringed at the highest level , which the directive needed to achieve .
( PT ) Mr President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the crisis is unprecedented .
Their impact will be more effective and will be less costly for taxpayers if we can coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing guidelines for visa facilitation for Belarusians and for the readmission agreement .
Let me give a special example .
Take , for example , child education and education .
We still do not know whether the standards that we are promoting in legal trade in timber will be brought into force and whether they will be applied globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this problem .
The creation of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by Member States in support of sustainable quality growth is a very important step .
I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow more effective vaccines to be used and reduce the bureaucracy faced by livestock farmers .
I voted in favour of this report , insofar as it calls for a strong , integrated European policy .
By abstaining , I would like to express my deep disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which was significantly weaker for our citizens .
Late payments often create difficulties for the internal market and cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy of responsibility and discipline in the budget , not one of the controversy , but we must not call on the citizens to make every effort , because they are the only ones who can emerge from this crisis .
In the United States , there is an early warning system for this .
One of these cases concerns my own electorate , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , freedoms and our democracy .
Come on : that is what the public asked for when choosing this Parliament , and it must be if we want more voters in five years &apos; time .
At this meeting , we discussed the issues contained in the document in which the European Council is competent , and they were approved by the European Council .
Private consumer spending calculated per person grew by more than 80 % in the last decade .
At the moment , I would consider it useful to think carefully about the right ways to monitor the legislation in force .
The conclusions of the summit are very fragile in this regard .
To this end , the proposal provides harmonised documents to facilitate recovery or precaution measures in order to prevent problems relating to the recognition and translation of documents originating in other Member States , as well as a standard forms of leave used to report on available documents on the territory of another Member State .
I agree with these proposals on the 2011 budget , as important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States with a financial programme to promote cooperation at EU level .
For example , the decisions taken by the Council on 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 confirmed the Member States &apos; ability to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes , which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinocht - are even part of the laws of some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not , therefore , be regarded as support for the &apos; EU bathing &apos; either .
We are now doing more and more distance , and the Internet has now completely changed our way , partly because our lives have become ever more passionate .
In the area of information , we will provide information as comfortable as we receive it .
Finally , the best investment is investment in education for the young generation , and I mean lifelong learning .
We hope that the death penalty will be abolished everywhere .
I welcome the fact that these issues have been resolved satisfactorily in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , thousands of people , who often have small children and do not have sufficient resources , are affected .
Procedures are completely different when appealing to the Commission under the possible new treaty regulations or appealing to Parliament through the petitions procedure .
All parties to the Middle East conflict must respect human rights .
in writing . - ( ET ) Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain stability in the euro area .
We all have to shoulder our responsibilities .
However , to understand , UNESCO has made comments to the Chinese authorities about the impact of the reform on Kashgar &apos;s traditions and cultural heritage .
in writing . - Mr Schwab has proposed a report aimed at improving vehicle safety by introducing safety standards for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
We were hard hit by the economic and financial crisis , but we have demonstrated our ability to act and strengthened our resilience .
If we discuss Parliament &apos;s position with human rights organisations or with other external entities affected by this issue , if we do not reach an agreement , which I hope will not be the case , and if individual projects do so , I believe Parliament &apos;s position will still be supported and understood .
These Thursday afternoon sessions have become increasingly realistic in this House , not only in terms of the stupidity we see , but also in terms of the issues discussed and how they are handled .
I believe that it is still completely uncertain whether Moldova will be able to elect the President , and if not the case , the country will apparently submit new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , 1 January 1999 was launched by the European Economic and Monetary Union , and a single EU Member State introduced a common money .
( EL ) Mr President , I , too , support and am delighted with the compromise achieved , as it raises the question of the shortcomings in democracy that women , in particular , have faced in recent years in helping self-employed spouses in trade , craftspeople , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , without recognising the work of many years .
Our political views are , of course , very different and sometimes different .
I call it a climate right , because this is a relationship between developing countries and industrialised countries , as well as a desire to come up with a credible proposal so as to finance measures relating to the fight against climate change and its adaptation , as to show our willingness to lead the way .
I would therefore like to hear the Commission &apos;s view on this matter as well .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks , which benefited from support but did not choose a social approach similar to that .
I have not only three children , but also a child who is currently drinking milk only .
We are ready to bring together technical assistance programmes , which will be accompanied by difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities must take .
We now expect the Commission to prepare the strategy .
As you say , we need to constantly reform our statistics , and Eurostat is looking into that .
Sometimes I wonder whether we have not learnt enough from the consequences of our approach if we do not follow the EU &apos;s solutions to the problems and try to find something specific , even though we have to deal with it jointly .
It is also revealed that scientists suspected of the hypothesis have been excluded from the peer evaluation processes in order to avoid gaps in research being subjected to public scrutiny .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has brought more publicity to this very sinister aspect of society that we are still fighting with , and with which we are still struggling .
We are aware of the human species that we have to deal with here , and the agencies need to be aware that their part is that there is a greater risk , and so they need to be stricter .
In revising the Restriction of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive , it was most important for us to tighten safety standards for equipment and electronic homes sold in the European Union .
Preventative work is carried out mainly in schools , as this social group is the most exposed to drug addiction .
It expanded successfully , connecting the continent with the end of the Cold War , and now it is being called upon to maintain previous achievements and to continue integration when better times are coming .
Many Members wish an answer to their questions today and we need to act in good order .
However , those of us who participated in this were aware that there was no alternative but that problems in the dairy sector had to be solved , and hopefully we are now on the road to solving some of the problems facing the dairy sector .
Secondly , while the ECR Group fully supports the need for regulations on maternity and paternity leave , we have chosen to abstain on the related parts of the report , because we oppose the decision on domestic policy at EU level , which is something for the Member States to decide .
Finally , I would like to say that I believe that the next debates on this subject need to be linked to the question of EUBAM Rafah : how could this mission be reopened and expanded ?
Therefore , the Commission is monitoring the situation and acting where necessary , but I do not think that we should go beyond the structures of the Community legal system , and the Commission will definitely remain within the limits of Community law .
As our common aim is to achieve a real European External Action Service , which is not only a continuation of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we are debating today and voting on tomorrow , are extremely important .
in writing . - As there is a pressing gap between employment rates , salaries and access to leading positions between men and women , I call on Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national law .
in writing . - ( FR ) I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I would really like to hear the Commissioner say that no further progress will now be made in the next few weeks , unless these carcasses are caught .
We will look at this in the near future when we discuss the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on future mobility .
On Wednesday 20 October , the European Parliament adopted its report on the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
We are already talking about tax increases in the near future in order to keep public finances at the mercy .
Now is the time for us to make a loud call for followers from Christians and other religions to be able to exercise their faith .
Throughout the EU 31.5 % of women work in part-time ( up to 30 hours per week ) , whereas this figure is only 8.3 % for men .
I share the cautious optimism of the Commissioner and the Minister , and I believe that the skipper is lying , even though much is still missing .
At the time , only a few were able to be able to recognise the extent of the future economic crisis .
The European Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction and shows itself on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent report .
Cohesion policy has become an integral part of the economic stimulus package , providing added value and supporting actions to promote reforms and sustainable economic growth , while also demonstrating European solidarity .
It is also unfortunate that we do not yet know whether the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force and when it will enter into force ; we clearly need to promote its entry into force .
In my opinion , however , the situation shows the terrible situation of the agricultural sector , especially in my region , if farmers are to be able to afford to release several days from winter in order to allow them to access reasonable low-level EU funding .
The Member States of southern Europe have reacted too late .
This should be done by creating smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of the citizens , we will announce our will in a democratic vote , so tomorrow will be a very important day .
It has to be said that housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in a modern state of welfare .
In my opinion , defining political priorities means that they should be subject to scrutiny , they should be transparent and democratic .
This particular project concerns the introduction of traffic management systems .
( HU ) In recent months , in Vojvodina , Northern Serbia , there has once again been a climate of fear among many of the nationalities living there , primarily among Hungarians .
What we are about to vote on now is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I really understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved , for us , a result that is practical and viable .
We agree with the elements of the proposal that Parliament and the Council be treated equally with regard to access to meetings and the provision of information , with regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament , cooperation in the context of citizens &apos; initiatives , impact assessments should be carried out , and ( with non-binding legislation ) , but we do not agree to the transposition and transposition of compulsory time directives into the European Union .
You know that access to radio spectrum is a sine qua non for broadcasting , and the EU &apos;s principles include ensuring that all market players have access to radio spectrum .
It provides the Commission with a general and fairly broad framework in terms of promoting equality between women and men in the areas mentioned just now by the honourable Member , employment and other areas where it is important to ensure and ensure equality .
We expect other countries of political and economic importance to make proposals , many of which have not worked so far .
In particular , dementia and Alzheimer &apos;s are serious medical problems , but they are also a huge ethical and social problem , and their severity is continually increasing as the European population ages .
You also emphasised very carefully the fact that we must not confuse different responsibilities , and in no way would I wish to confuse Member States &apos; responsibilities with the responsibilities of the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs who have tackled the details of this matter : József Szájer , Andrew Duff , Monica Frassoni and Hne Dahl .
We have taken our hands and offered the full support of all the European institutions : the leadership of Belarus , take it against , because you and the people of Belarus have a lot to gain .
We need to monitor closely what happens , because the Presidency said that we would have a EUR 38 billion annual savings from European companies .
Now , following the verdict of Liu Xiaobo , we are even seeing how the police has banned homosexuals and how dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals are threatening a political stay in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report today on Ukraine was very clear .
In this context , it must be acknowledged that this will only be achieved if the parliaments are involved , as most of the provisions can only be duly adapted through parliaments , and that this process , as well as the proposals for dialogue and the Transatlantic Legislators &apos; Assembly , are very important .
Someone talked about helicopters .
Mr President , Commissioner , I was very pleased to see you and to listen to your speech .
That is what I wanted to emphasise with regard to this agreement .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a strong message to self-employed women who assist their spouses .
Anyone who has visited Gaza since the conflict can say that the people are suffering enormously .
( EL ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is the most important relationship for the European Union , from a strategic point of view .
I have to say that it is our goal to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we know that the EU cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , the large number of participants in Copenhagen fills me with hope that there will ultimately be a chance to succeed with such a large number of allies .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , I am in favour of the motion for a resolution to be tabled , because I think Martin Schulz said something very important : if we really want this debate to cover &apos; Europe &apos; , and not only Italy , it makes no sense to vote on a resolution entitled &apos; freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I therefore decided to vote in favour of this report .
Parliament &apos;s recommendation suggests that the regulation provided by the Council be adopted and no longer delayed , as the new regulation would simplify the procedures and guarantee equal treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the field of social protection .
This is a rather shocking chapter , which I also mentioned in my report on the previous parliamentary term .
EU policy on the Arctic may not be as strange as the appointment of Baroness Ashton , the former student left , Sarah Palin .
One of these achievements is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement concluded by the European Union , through time and must be used to measure our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment on freezing the budget at 2013 levels , because I firmly believe that the budget must now be reduced , and their stand is a weak starting point for negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I believe that we have paid far too little attention to the development of new cars , to hydrogen cars , to vans and to cars using fuel cells .
Then we go to each and every one of our own deeds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
The European Union , which is Thailand &apos;s partner , is ready , as far as possible , to support the country in this complicated process .
Indeed , in order for the derogation which is to be created to benefit local populations and not to harm the EU &apos;s fish processing and canning industries , it was vital to demand an immediate assessment of the impact of the exemption and , if necessary , to suspend it .
Their aim is to ensure that gas supplies are restored as quickly as possible and , of course , to threaten justice is not a very effective approach .
It is imperative that Member States investigate the serious human rights violations committed against Roma women without delay , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and reimbursed .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a rather complicated issue .
I would like to draw attention not only to the importance of cooperation with the national supervisory authorities , but also - and this has not yet been mentioned - of cooperation with the national parliaments , especially with the committees responsible for European affairs , the budget and budgetary supervision .
My proposal is that , at a time when the European External Action Service is drawing up its rules on access to information and documents , you are making it a modern organisation to which citizens can contact and which does not deal with foreign policy as if only belongs to stealth diplomats .
All countries are undertaking changes to their economic policy , with the aim of getting rid of the unfavourable economic situation as soon as possible and achieving at least some economic growth .
I would also like to tell you about the people of Japan .
President Barroso responded to this : this is an internal matter .
That is why we belong to those who believe that the Schengen acquis should not be undermined , but rather must be retained and strengthened .
It is no secret that the origins of our European identity are burned directly by a Christian tradition .
It benefits big businesses , but it confuses public transport and is responsible for discrediting net and safety .
On the other hand , the debate on Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot be excluded .
This risk must be managed effectively and , as shown by the tragic events in Japan , urgent .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against all injuries caused by sharp objects in medicine .
In short , I may be finalising this report this evening , but the work is still far from finished , either for me or for the institutions of the European Union .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and stress that my group has been - from the outset - very cautious about the adoption of SIS II , as it has a number of implications for data protection in many ways .
The appropriate conditions must be created .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman received a total of 3 098 complaints and 3 406 complaints in 2008 , which represents a 9 % decrease .
The Court of Justice of the European Union also clearly rejected , in its judgment of October , the transition to compulsory retirement when the retirement age was met .
The use of EGNOS and GNSS systems also offers significant potential in the area of safety and the environment and the smooth use of road transport , which can be used to collect road tolling .
In the area of cohesion policy , which represents almost a third budget , this is the only budget area with an estimated error rate of over 5 % .

We are committed to creating the conditions under which the fisheries sector is truly sustainable and able to develop in the long term .
I have no doubt that living conditions in a wonderful Arctic region have been harsh , I do not doubt that new technologies and steps forward will inevitably facilitate the exploitation of resources in the region , which is an example of which fishing is a good one .
As a result of the economic crisis , the unemployment rate among young people reached 20 % at the beginning of the year , while the percentage of early school drop-out rates rose to 17 % , mainly young people in rural areas .
Today , the market has a very large number of ecolabels , identifiers and texts that can cause confusion to consumers , with the image of forests in trees containing hazardous substances , the coal footprint of footwear is claimed to be ecological .
We voted against this motion because it wanted to place responsibility on the plight of the undeveloped third world on the shoulders of the EU Member States and not on their shoulders .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I apologise for taking everybody &apos;s time and delaying the south-west , but I will do so only once in ten years , so maybe this will not harm .
This is a sensitive task that needs to change things for the better , and she simply does not have sufficient experience .
Only a year ago , we accepted the repeal of these rules and , although consumers have not noticed a lot , producers have noticed it and are still finding it .
I believe that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only aimed at austerity and at limiting the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) to be cut back , because that would mean that the value of agriculture in Europe would be reduced .

( DE ) The President of the Republic of Latvia , Mr Zatlers , is a great honour for us all today to welcome you on your first visit to the European Parliament .

When a readmission agreement is concluded with a possible third country in the transit of illegal immigration , which is the objective of strengthening the agreements between the European Union and that third country ( which is the general approach and philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration ) , then also strengthens the borders of the Member States of the Union .
We regret that the report does not fully take into account our proposal , but we are delighted that the conclusion that it has reached is very close to our view .
Given that the promotion of a more competitive agricultural system in an open global trade environment is one of the tasks that President Barroso gave to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I take advantage of the Commissioner &apos;s presence in the Chamber to ask him what kind of cooperation with his agricultural colleagues in order to conclude the negotiations in the Doha Round ?
The report proposes simplifying financial monitoring and control , as well as strengthening the scientific and technological evaluation process through a peer review based on knowledge .
The proposals put forward here today must be considered , analysed and interpreted in this light .
Similarly , legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , financial rules and , in some cases , intellectual property rights ) need to be highlighted , which may lead many key actors in the field of research and SMEs to abandon their participation .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission intends to review Directive 2007 / 52 on the basis of the considerations it has just read .
I therefore also voted in favour of the paragraphs emphasising corporate social responsibility .
We see that , with regard to the new aspect that we have developed together , namely transparency , progress has been rather slow and , in fact , with the new regulations on access to documents , the opportunities for those seeking infringement proceedings or infringement proceedings to find out why they have been concluded or why they have been launched , are weakened to everyone &apos;s scale .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) As my colleague Charles Tannock said , the terrible human rights situation in Burma has been spoken before the European Parliament , which , unfortunately , is always half empty at this time .

In the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is now very important - perhaps even more important than ever .
Because of Fossil fuels , energy supply is concentrated and becomes a carbon market and an inflexible one .
In this regard , I agree with my fellow Members .
( HU ) Mr President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU is halfway through , so it is worth considering what has been achieved so far .
I believe that the review of the first railway package must identify problems in those Member States that have received reasoned opinions from the Commission , as well as ways of solving them .
Israel does not realise that such large-scale military responses will boost the potential of new suicide measurements and that they will abandon new Cassas at the first possible opportunity .
The Burmese authorities have decided not to ignore the protests and calls for the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi by many countries and organisations , including UN Secretary-General , ASEAN , as well as a number of ASEAN Member States of which Burma belongs to .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
Mr Cutaş has told us that the EIB &apos;s actions in the EU budget were almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009 , which is a great deal for the EU , and I therefore believe that Parliament is fully entitled to wait for an explanation of the risks involved in this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved the project , but both on behalf of Timo Soini and on my own behalf , I would like to ask what the information about the project is that all citizens of the Baltic States need before building works are started .

In these circumstances , by allowing the Moldovan Government to impose uncertain European programmes and agencies such as , for example , the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and the Single European Sky ATM Research project , although Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , seems cynical .
This means two birds with one stone , as this infrastructure can contribute to the European economy and create jobs , while at the same time mitigating the effects of similar crises .
The summit between the EU and Russia in Hanty-Mann agreed on our common objective of reaching a strategic agreement that would provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations in the near future and would help to develop the potential of our cooperation .
It is clear now that we are still lagging behind what is needed in the handling of the Mediterranean and , in particular , of Libya : we need to think a little more about it in recognising that we need perhaps more vigorous measures to understand what is happening in the Mediterranean area , and also in order to apply joint action .
It was a prerequisite for the substantial funding granted by the EU to the local population to support the project and for some of the funding to come from private Italian investors .

in writing . - ( LT ) I support the Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies to improve energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .

Particularly at a time of global financial crisis , this partnership may be very important and open up greater opportunities for commercial , scientific and technical exchanges and make us out of this crisis stronger and more serious .
We can no longer tolerate this being done .
The adoption and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has increased Parliament &apos;s responsibility and , at the same time , the associated administrative burden .
In this unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , we must do everything we can to ensure that the number of unemployed or working poor in the EU does not rise to 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption , which I proposed together with four other Members of the European Parliament , and which has been approved by more than half of the Members of the European Parliament , with the aim of binding legislation that really effectively combat corruption .

( DE ) Mr President , I would again like to look at one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the police and judicial spheres : SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , that is , the transfer of SWIFT banking data to the United States .
In 2009 , it turned out that there had been an alarming increase in the use of different forms of protection , both in individual Member States of the European Union and in new emerging economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency has not been taken seriously - neither the Commission nor the Council .
Finally , from a political point of view , it is important for our alliance with ACP countries within the World Trade Organisation .
We need to do something else .
If we can help bring together the abandoned orphans and the family who are fleeing children , we will have done important work .

The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and on the EU strategy for humanitarian aid .

At a time of global instability and economic and financial crisis , the EU must increase its strategic autonomy so that it can defend its values , defend its interests and protect its citizens by developing a common vision for tackling the major challenges and threats , and by targeting its resources and resources so that it can respond adequately to these expectations , thereby contributing to the preservation of world peace and security .
This is a good period in relations between the two parties , and the results of the overall agreement in force are good .
The common register is a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which I hope will help increase the legitimacy of the European project in the eyes of the citizens .

In sensitive sectors such as clothing , leather goods and furniture , creating conditions that would allow consumers to make informed choices is an important issue for those companies that have decided to maintain European knowledge and European jobs .

It would appear that we have spent too much time discussing each other rather than having discussions with others on a daily basis , and we were ultimately deeply neglected .

The resolution adopted today underlines the fact that the establishment of a common register will ensure the widest possible participation of all groups of operators , while respecting their different or specific identities .
As a member of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has been urgent in reacting to the images we have received in recent weeks from the Mediterranean , where many people fleeing the situation in Africa have managed to arrive in Europe , while others have failed in their business .
However , this is not being done , and the situation in Lampedusa is a sad example of this .
Israel bombs and dismantles ghettos .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s opinions , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The question of the CAP and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
It must be a partnership based on respect for one another , on respect for our shared commitment , and also on respect for the values that the European Union defends in terms of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
This sector accounts for 3 % of EU GDP , with a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment in this regard calling - referring , of course , not only to Europe , but also to the United States , as the Commissioner knows very well - for all types of export subsidies to be dismantled completely and rapidly .
Most of the comments highlight the need to target or focus the common agricultural policy on the competitiveness of European agriculture , tackling climate change , food safety and quality standards and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on :
It is , of course , very important that the European Union increase its special support for cities , which are the ones with the greatest potential for the economy and finance , because the crisis has hit cities particularly hard .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; special report will only be formally presented in the Committee on Budgetary Control next week .
We need significant resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 40 % recommended by scientists and to halt the decline in biodiversity .
Only a carrot-and-stick approach , which is an integral part of the dynamism of the accession process , can make the governments of these countries focus on it and on implementing reforms that will ensure stability and well-being in the Western Balkans once and for all .
I am going to focus on two reports for their importance .
In the interests of legal protection for all concerned , we need to give equal rights to those accused of crimes throughout Europe and these rights to be informed .
Foreign policy and diplomacy fall within the sphere of national sovereignty , which is why we voted against all relevant reports .
I would also like to draw your attention to the estimates that have been made by the Venice Commission in similar cases , and to Mr Weber I am now going to state that I am referring to Article d .
I also appreciated the positive assessment in the motion for a resolution of the OSCE &apos;s continued efforts to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened only a few hours ago in Greece will not be seized , and I hope that this can , on the contrary , be the beginning of a European identity and partnership forming a united front .
We have been in contact with those in Tunisia and Egypt every hour and with our delegations to whom I would like to pay tribute to what they have had to deal with in recent weeks , and we have also been in direct contact with the government and with the services .
In fact , I am convinced that this financing instrument will be gaining very special value at a time of financial crisis , as it can help businesses to recover more effectively and can , in future , set up a pilot project in order to create an even more generous fund .
Those checks were not competent .
We can then make a significant contribution from the EU , but it must not be a matter of reflection .
I voted in favour of this report on the special report by the European Ombudsman following the draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT .
In comparison with previous legislation , the greatest progress achieved in this directive is that patients can choose the health care provider and be informed about the quality and safety of their treatment .
I would reiterate the need for the European Commission to be flexible in mobilising the Solidarity Fund and in reforming regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund so that they can meet the needs of the disaster .
After consulting with consumer rights organisations and representatives of business , I believe that we need to call for greater harmonisation of consumer rights in the European Union .
I have said that whoever asked questions is in the light of this debate .
This means that Parliament has the right and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case , trade negotiations - and to stay informed as the negotiations go forward , to intervene politically with the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as the consultations , resolutions and the oral questions .
The investments of citizens in social cohesion or inter-generational solidarity are not recognised .
However , the real reform is linked to the admissibility of a petition .
This is one of the most serious human rights issues in today &apos;s European Union .
To this end , the necessary financial resources must be available to the EU to take advantage of opportunities and new sources of global competition .
In many countries of the European Union , in a difficult situation when public authorities are in a difficult situation , they are generally aware that they are overdue and very often driven to some company bankruptcy .
At the G20 , too , the abolition of tax havens was one of the key objectives .
No response belongs to politicians .
The Dollari continues , of course , to remain a &apos; window of business &apos; in the world and is still a safe currency , but the huge debts that the United States has been charging in trying to get the rest of the world to finance its life expectancy more and more doubts about the ability of the world &apos;s largest economic power to honour its commitments .
We need to ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures at its disposal in order to combat and overcome people who are trying to destroy it .
It is telling that , when Iceland was a rich country , it was not interested in joining the European Union .
Vice-President , this is not a new request .
It is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and for involving everyone in order to ensure broad acceptance at local level .
However , it is a problem that takes the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions as long as the struggle in Afghanistan continues .
We must avoid fragmentation , which is why I call on Commissioner Andor to maintain the European Social Fund ( ESF ) in its regulations and not to divide it , as suggested in Parliament at the time .
It is , of course , natural that we should not get everything in the compromise that we want , an issue that I believe is important to us and which I would like to emphasise is our opportunity to achieve a greener CAP .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mr Haug , for their constructive attitude throughout the budgetary procedure , which also illustrates the very good cooperation that we have enjoyed here .
The Socialist Group cannot overlook the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
I think it would have been better to emphasise that there are limits to the negotiations , so as to make room for more realistic alternatives , such as a more recommended partnership .
It is therefore primarily a problem for the Americans that must be solved in Washington .
I would also like to say that we should implement a reform that will make European universities more independent and European , open to students and researchers , in order to create the dynamic development of the information society .
The quotas that are to be purchased can be maintained in the face of the mountain reserves that it can be distributed later on if the Member States so wish .
I , too , appeal once again for his execution , for 25 May , to be designated as International Day of Remembrance of the Catories against Totalitarianism , because many unknown people who lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms deserve to be remembered .
I would like to say briefly what we have done .
If this becomes the view of the majority of the European Parliament in the next parliamentary term , we will be destroying the peace plan drawn up after the Balkan wars , which has been funded a great deal .
I hope that all of these people will be encouraged to participate in EMAS , not because of numbers or because EMAS is doing the ISO , but because I believe that the system is good and can help us achieve the sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be very important , and I think it will be good .
We must no longer allow dumping and its social consequences .
This issue is crucial for ensuring an effective Neighbourhood Policy .
By identifying best practice based on the experience of the Member States , we respect fundamental requirements such as non-discrimination and equal and fair treatment , as well as protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we have arguments for a single European policy on this matter .
I am aware that in the context of public consultation on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep meat sector supported mandatory origin marking .
Mr Kelly , I am very aware of the complexity of the issue .
Although most countries have many economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to preventing the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will launch a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system .
In general , therefore , these measures have generally increased the level of equality .
Like the European Parliament , the Commission has the right to express its opinion on the audit process .
For example , the amount of fraud fraud fraud fraud in France and Spain is considered to be &apos; suspect low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council cut off 2003 .
They are interested in solutions and whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to develop networks for the sharing of statistical information and to establish a forum for coordinating research into the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also agree with many of the views that have been expressed in this House that the more solidarity Europe is , the better our relations with Russia .
Syria has much to improve in transit as to what freedom of expression and assembly comes .
Much remains to be done before we can guarantee equal access to the labour market for women .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal needs to be reviewed , taking into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is unacceptable .
I am in favour of the report because I would particularly like to highlight the following point : the lack of reliable and comprehensive consumer information on the health impact , composition and origin of various types of fish species .
After all , history is full of examples of Western intervention , which have caused more harm than profit .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and fails to implement the crime prevention system for a number of reasons .
Palestinian reconciliation is a key political event and , contrary to what has just been said here , Hamas has , for the first time , accepted the fact that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority are acting as its negotiating partner .
Countries argue and negotiate the division of seafarers .
The latter is particularly important in view of the problems with energy infrastructure that ...
In other words , this institution , which has been set up to protect us criminals ( indirectly by training the police ) , ends up in the pockets of the accused .
However , the transfer of power from Fidel Castro to his brother Raúl Castro has not led to democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners .
Energy performance categories are also presented in all advertising containing information about energy consumption or related to the price of products .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know the Washington Consensus : you have it .
In this way , we would also provide an adequate response to the situation on the ground , which Frontex is already aware of .
Finally , I would again like to thank the members of the various committees involved , as well as the shadow rapporteurs , for their constructive and very positive contributions .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this , and I very much appreciate the fact that the Presidency will support us in trying to find a viable way forward .
Thanks , in particular , to their involvement in private companies , the candidate Wessberg has a particularly good capacity to ensure a balance between EU law and the specific demands of both market and European citizens .
So far , the conflict has claimed 1 000 lives during 17 days .
Such action will reduce the number of falsified medicinal products and will contribute to the safety of the use of medicines .
We have to learn from the Opel case ; it is not yet too late to launch a coordinated Community strategy for the car sector .
We do this because , like you , President Obama and I personally reject the wrong choice between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro proposes that there must be a permanent measure on pay discipline .
Recently , a new experiment was launched at Manchester airport , and the legal advice that has now been obtained suggests that minors &apos; use this equipment may be violated by the inherent nature of the legislation on child safety and protection .
In addition , this money does not go directly to artists .
The development of the system and the use of EGNOS applications should be supported in the production of landings in civil aviation .
Common rules and standards for inspection and survey organisations , as well as for the relevant activities of shipping authorities ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for inspection and surveying installations ( recast ) - Requirements and standards for monitoring by Sates States - for monitoring the Community monitoring and , in the case of maritime accident investigations - for shipping accidents - for shipping - for maritime transport purposes - air carriage monitoring and maritime transport certificates ) .
I am voting in favour of the report on the new microfinance facility , which is aimed at helping people who risk losing their jobs , setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
I agree with it and believe that it will allow us to define better the legal framework of the urban dimension and also to introduce instruments such as urban action programmes , which will allow cohesion policy to be given a new quality .
During the trialogue , it became clear to me that my improvements on behalf of Parliament are essential for achieving a fair and efficient energy market .
In the current economic crisis , it is very important to support and encourage self-employed workers .
There is therefore no need to ask them about Brussels .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , for us and for Europe , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us Europeans , it is clear that energy has become an instrument for foreign policy change that can give rise to controversy or combine us , and that is exactly what we are discussing today .
I voted in favour of this report because the food programme , which is being considered to extend , is a key instrument for helping the most vulnerable people affected by the current economic crisis and for meeting their basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all Member States of the European Union , have at least one officially supported export credit agency , which together constitute the world &apos;s largest source of public funding for private sector projects .
Therefore , we will not vote in favour of the report .
When we took this position , we helped break with the common government .
When Sarkozy was the Minister of the Interior in 2003 when he was the French Council of Muslims ( CFCM ) , he brought Islam to French state institutions .
In this regard , I have already asked the European Commission &apos;s opinion and asked the Commission to consider creating special programmes for greater equality between women in scientific life .
We will continue this fight in order to ensure that citizens &apos; rights are protected and that end users receive services without restrictions .
Europe &apos;s major politicians and thinkers understood full well that a common approach to economic problems was the driving force behind Europe .
The limits of freedom and security do not end up within the limits of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , from June this year , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating this strategy when it comes to progress in key areas such as the promotion of basic education , vocational governance and employment .
The costs will cost the country of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the region .
It can therefore be expected that this reactor accident will occur every 25 years .
When eligibility of housing interventions is now being extended from the ERDF to cofinanced costs , I believe that we should consider other possible development needs , both medium- and long-term , relating to eligibility or the reimbursement of funds for certain strategic objectives .
Once again , it is time to discuss violations of religious rights in the same region ; this time , they are Christians who are victims .
Climate change : one of the biggest dangers threatening our planet .
Particular attention was , of course , given , as I was expecting , to human rights - the importance of ensuring that they are clearly part of all our dynamic relations and that they are included in our work .
I must also say that , hitherto , the European Union had no competence in regulating air transport at all .
However , the EU is not a bail-out or medicine for the economic crisis .
I can therefore confirm the commitment made by the rapporteur to the comitology procedure and alternative regulations already made by the Commission .
I think that nothing of the warm speeches that have been made here today , along with the Commission &apos;s considerations , does not change the fact that the European Union is absent in Libya and that it cannot get out of the crisis in cities or Gaddafi troops at the moment .
I therefore firmly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , it will be of great benefit to European citizens , who will be able to use much greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I share the hope that the European Council will agree on measures to convince the markets and to once again stabilise the euro area because , whether we are Members or not , we should all be interested in it .
Support for accession has proved to be particularly vulnerable to abuses .
This gives rise to great thanks and pleasure .
We therefore call for an end to war and violence by all parties , and we call on the EU to act accordingly .
The world outside Europe is trying to meet the energy challenge .
The energy performance indicator for buildings must be mentioned in the case of sales and leasing bills published in the media .
It is important to promote measures to increase European investment in the diversification of cross-border structures and incentives for the development of new , alternative forms of energy at local level and to improve the opportunities for infrastructure to facilitate the use of new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the foundation of an effectively functioning internal market , thus enabling the growth of domestic demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the creation of a rapid working platform within the framework of the ENP in order to react swiftly and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as happened recently in the Southern Neighbourhood .
In my opinion , it is simply ironic for the EULEX mission to support Serbia in this House to be condemned .
For this reason , the problem is that you are only able to listen to the Members who are able to follow you in the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency is emphasising citizens , our voters , particularly the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , job protection and the fight against crime , which , in order to do a good job , must be in line with those who voted on us .
The EU budget cannot , as some MEPs claim , be used as a complement to the national budgets during a period of austerity ; rather , the difficult situation of the Member States should be reflected in this .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Treaty on European Union ( EU ) has not granted the Council the power to interfere in the national constitutions of the Member States .
It is not a normal approach .
You can tell me cynical , but students do not always get to study and tourists do not always get to a short time .
Will we be faced with a global financial crisis or with our own mistakes and lack of action ?
My second objection relates to the role that the Belgian Presidency has played in the post-Lisbon period .
The overriding aim of these governments has been to keep a huge country in the home , a country with completely different nations .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative effects .
This is very much the case in many areas of Japan , but I recognise Japan &apos;s rights , for example , to protect its most deprived farmers , to pay their farmers higher prices than those on the world market , and to ban massive imports , which would destroy the rural farmers , in the same way as recognising the right of our own economy to safeguard some sectors of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to talk about two issues , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to act in accordance with this new strategy in order to strengthen social priorities , which I already stated when we discussed the broader policy guidelines for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will go straight to you and ask you what measures - in multilingualism - the Commission will take to address these problems in the short term .
That is precisely what has been lacking so far , or it has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens .
It does not interest the citizens , which is absolutely right .
( The sitting closed at 12.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong message and adopt , by a very large majority , a report which I would like to thank Mrs Muscardini and the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Susta .
At the same time , Romania has advocated a policy of open doors with the aim of strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine in particular .
I firmly believe that , in addition to this , every effort must be made to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to rebuild living conditions .
I refer clearly not only to the cases of job security that occur quite often , but also to dangerous substances used in labour processes .
In September 2009 , the Council launched a detailed study of the proposal to amend the decision establishing a European Refugee Fund .
At such a time , it is important to pay particular attention to the situation of islands and peripheral regions , which are now faced with a situation where infrastructure , personal and commercial property of people have been destroyed , and people are unable , in many cases , to return to normality , especially in areas that are almost exclusively dependent on tourism because they have been able to take out of tourist information .
This sector has not had such major economic losses since 11 September and , regardless of the current financial difficulties in all Member States , I would urge them to support plans to support industry that can no longer cope with losses .
At the same time , we must recognise that the risks of our exposure are also increasing .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is really shocking .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a minor and perhaps semantic comment .
( The sitting closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Of course , everyone has the right to hope for something to happen - although passionate - but the facts do have to be accepted .
Consumer organisations favour binding action as collective redress mechanisms in all Member States , along with other options , such as extending existing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to collective claims .
The problem is not the Turks of Cyprus , as some have already been proven .
I therefore ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin and do not have to withstand long and stress journeys to countries where they are manufactured .
That is what we need to do .
I am really wondering , ladies and gentlemen , where human rights defenders have gone , who , like us , are pleased that the West has paralysed and pluralistic and who shamefully look away from the Middle East , which is gradually reserved for one religious faith .
This is the case , and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , Mr Schulz , our washing bankers are cheap , but politicians who are now charging up deficits and debt behind younger generations are just as irresponsible .
I would like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies for this , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various political groups .
We believe that it is now time for the Member States to act .
Mr President , the Commission and Parliament worked well together on the financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights ; the relationship was actually a very cooperative one .
Our goal should be to ensure that the programmes available provide maximum support for the reforms committed by these countries in order to approach the Union .
It is also very important for every Member State to maintain national contact points so that patients receive all the necessary information , such as access to healthcare , procedures and the necessary documents .
Earlier , we felt all the events in the Soviet Union as an ideological pressure , but we are now discussing trade under the terms of absolute individual freedom .
Irrespective of whether the fund is considered to be a private or a public matter , it is a very specific report , namely that Parliament states , firstly , that it does not have legal claims for the financing of losses , and so forth , that no losses will be financed either .
These are probably the most expensive faces , then Trojan Helenan , which left thousands of vessels in water .
Support distorting competition undermines the future of the European car industry and has a negative impact on employment and technological development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need to bear some points in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard several Members say that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact and a reverse voting mechanism .
( FR ) Having said that , I think it is important to return to what is fundamentally at stake .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
In order to show solidarity with the campaign to end this barbaric ritual rhetoric , I call on you all to carry out a rose-lean front today , which symbolises our opposition to this practice .
The control of democracy is being marginalised , because national governments are hiding behind the Commission and troika in most of the fundamental measures , while the Commission is transferring these matters to the national governments .
The new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
With the Commission &apos;s threatening legal action , Sweden now allows the BDEE to do so .
For those of us who come from rural electoral circles , and for those who are in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , it is clear that the current situation in which many livestock farmers are in is simply unacceptable .
Savers deserve open information that is easily understandable and accessible .
I believe that our role could be to support the Chinese people in achieving a harmonious society .
I voted in favour of these two mechanisms , as I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to stabilise European public finances and thus safeguard our future .
It is also important that the organisers of the initiative - the social organisation or the NGOs - define clearly and unequivocally the subject and objective of the initiative , even though it does not necessarily have to submit a legislative resolution .
There is a city in Latvia , there is Daugag , where more than 90 % of the population is Russian .
In this regard , I welcome the apologies made by Prime Minister Fischer , as well as the Czech Government recently made a proposal calling on the Ministry of Health of the country to implement a series of measures to ensure that there will no longer be such violations by 31 December 2009 .
in writing . - ( LT ) I welcomed this report , because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
Now the financial and economic crisis has completely disguised the effects of globalisation , and our considered reaction is to change the financial criteria for the EGF .
This resolution takes note of the declaration of independence issued by Kosovo on 17 February 2008 , recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to step up their common approach to Kosovo , taking into account Kosovo &apos;s intentions to join the EU .
In comparison with both other institutions , Parliament can still be considered to be a pioneer in terms of transparency , so I would not make it my top priority , because both in terms of access to European Parliament documents and in terms of transparency and the activities of its sittings are more transparent than any national parliament .
That was the internal policy pursued by the Italian Minister for Reform , Umberto Bosnia .
Asturias - in my region - warnings from the Centre for the Monitoring of Human Rights and many other organisations need to be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of the Casini report .
I find it deeply regrettable that Parliament has adopted this resolution prohibiting the use of this and beef thrombin .
That is why I decided to abstain and I am going to follow the ongoing investigation closely .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data are not entirely sufficient to determine what measures should be taken to discipline Member States with the highest level of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement to honour the fifth European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting closed at 16.25 )
What is more , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions by 20 % in sectors outside the Emissions Trading System .
Turning to the second question , I can assure honourable Members that the Commission is aware of the need for a multidisciplinary approach to control microbial resistance .
Yesterday , the trialogue gave rise to a great deal of hope for a final agreement .
The estimates for the future , based on approximately 27 % annual growth in the next few years , indicate that the value will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that the text would be in the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what ACTA is about , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because EU financial support will help people who are victims of globalisation to find work and reintegrate into the labour market and help them overcome the discipline of the recession .
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions , development and information for citizens , particularly through the sending of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of the report and hope that the EU will have a leading role in the field of radio spectrum and in creating development and innovation software programmes .
And all this brings together ordinary concerns about differences and problems in relation to Turkey and Europe &apos;s culture and science , which would lead to the accession of a country with more than 80 million inhabitants : they are factors that reinforce my conviction that it is not right for Turkey to join the EU , above all , the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This means compromising the environment and consumer safety , because old , energy-consuming and potentially dangerous appliances would be placed back on the market .
Thank you for your attention , and I look forward to the debate .
I wanted to put on record my thanks to the mayor of Balingen , Mr Reitemann , and to the mayor of the city council , who authorised these young men to commemorate .
Thirdly , I would very much like to ask Commissioner Kroes to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we want to be proud of this wonderful flagship project in the future .
Anyone who experienced and saw the consequences of the environmental disaster caused by technological distraction in Baia Maria and the subsequent liberalisation of the toxic cyanide emissions to water for seas consequences in Hungary and in the Danube River Bulgaria would do everything possible to ensure that nothing similar could happen again in the European Union .
It is the responsibility of everyone : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change costs developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year .
Secondly , it is about the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and their skills : in your words , it is about the fundamental right to move across borders .
I therefore agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal to reject this proposal in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
What is important is that we found the courage to convene this summit , that we invite the social partners to take part , that we prepare it with them for a long time - before the Working Summit there are discussions in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we try to reach conclusions that are valuable for the June Council .
In fact , at first reading , the European Parliament established a good basis for the correct application of rules on the provision of cross-border healthcare in the Member States so that patients can , if necessary , be able to access open or hospital treatment in another Member State without burden .
This was also proposed in the Barnier report , but there has been no agreement so far on this matter .
There is no time to waste .
Through a new irrational step which distorts reality , the European Parliament is dishonourable about trying to interfere in Venezuela affairs .
In the end of 2009 , the Commission published a document containing new information and opinions from the various users on this matter , and I will address the results of this public consultation in a moment .
Thank you for your participation .
I would like to add that where a person is held in detention , it is in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights .
I hope that this amendment will gain majority support tomorrow .
The Copenhagen Communication forms the basis for the development of the European Union &apos;s positions on key points and enables us to maintain a leading role and to help the negotiations to succeed in Copenhagen .
Secondly , at this point , the Commission does not have clear answers to a number of questions and problems raised by honourable Members , such as geographical coverage , the coverage of Objective 2 or the existence of existence , an appropriate financial basis , transitional arrangements or the status of individual groups in the regions .
Secondly , it promotes fundamental rights as a priority of the Stockholm Programme by drawing up strategic guidelines for the development of an area of freedom , security and justice in Europe .
in writing . - ( SV ) We have once again chosen to give our support to the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , which is still suffering from the effects of the economic crisis and which is exceptional times require exceptional measures , and this time we need approximately 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The Commission should not carry out these assessments if it is useless , unnecessary or costly .
The Arab League plan , the Saudi Arabia Peace Plan , anticipates the end of the violence , while acknowledging Israel &apos;s right to exist .
The EU must strive to ensure that the poorest countries are increasingly supported and that their debts are invalidated if necessary .
The Czech Presidency also acknowledged the importance of the matter , and I think we have achieved a good result , particularly for those who want to move freely within the EU .
Show me evidence that the transfer of aid increases the effectiveness of expenditure at European Union level .
The EU will maintain its view that the best way to shape post-2012 frameworks is an integrated , legally binding instrument .
I have even heard in this House today say that terrorism is a hysteria .
However , I am pleased that some of the fundamental rights laid down in this regulation are applied to passengers whose trips are not so long .
