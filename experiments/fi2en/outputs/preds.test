For everything that we are going to do in this country, it is crucial to ensure that the country complies with the rule of law, and this applies not only to the judiciary, of course, but also to political reform and constitutional reform.

This Commission proposal extends the concept of micro-enterprises to companies that do not exceed the following two criteria in respect of their annual accounts: the total annual accounts amount is EUR 500 000, the net turnover of EUR 1 000 and/or the average number of personnel during the validity period is 10 lives.
However, we need to keep our promises on climate change, and everyone acknowledges that we are leading the world on this issue.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I was not exactly prepared for this because I had not seen the timescales that have been completely changed today, but I am very grateful to the House for allowing me to speak about this very important area of financial services, namely the insurance and insurance sectors, about what we have done on Solvency II and how, in the end, we have been able to strengthen the European Parliament's very concrete regulatory basis.
So it is absolutely crucial to move up to 30% and, finally, I repeat what Barack Obama has said, namely that we can hand over future jobs to our competitors or we can seize the opportunity of the century, as they have already started to do.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make four observations.
That is why I, and a few other Members of this House, have also invited an expert here who has investigated the trafficking of organs and the deliberate killing of people who have met in China in order to obtain organs, who will speak tomorrow.

The EIB can and must play an important role in controlling the recent events in the Mediterranean region.
I therefore support the call for an examination of the profits margin in the production and distribution chain.
However, if you always want to prioritise the'polluter pays' principle - I am ready to discuss this with you - then Member States themselves cause congestion when they do not provide sufficient infrastructures.
Students of mobility need, firstly, to be given guidance on mobility.
However, it is important that we are aware that fires are particularly strong on the southern borders of Europe, here we have the opportunity to increase the level of ambition and the link that citizens feel in Europe's importance: the added value of the response.
Today, despite the fact that the proportion of people who are educated is higher than those who are more successful, such as China or India, is sinking into Europe.
That is why we need more and better Europe: a more united and more ambitious Europe.
I am sure that they are a step in the right direction.
The Greek Communist Party is opposed to and voted against amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure in order to adapt to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: it is really surprising that, while the growth indicators in Albania are steadily rising and economic growth were over 2% in 2010 at its worst, while 3% growth is being predicted for 2011, social tension is only getting worse and not false.
The trafficking of human beings remains a serious problem, including within the European Union.
There are also other issues that I would like to emphasise, as Mr Paparizov did, in the same way.
The EU can make a significant contribution in South Sudan to stabilisation, development and the improvement of the institutions' capacity.
As you said, Sri Lanka must implement the country's Constitution 13th amendment calling for the decentralisation of regional government, in which the EU can provide useful assistance.
I would also like to reiterate that there can, of course, be differences of opinion, and there are differences between the Commission and the Council, and also between some Members of Parliament - some would prefer separate legislation on river and maritime transport.
I agree with the proposal's underlying objective, which is to establish a coherent and comprehensive framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure within the Union, so that the Commission can monitor the development of planned investment projects in the energy sector.
The start was promising: there was a general consensus in 1995 that women and men are equal from all angles, including politics, the economy, justice and society.
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure the proper implementation of the rule of law and democratic principles, as well as to ensure that corruption continues to decrease in Serbia and that people who abuse their position receive severe punishment.
In short, the kind of Europe we are fighting for - a Europe that is fair and that is a Europe with social development that exists in terms of economic and social cohesion with sovereign states with equal rights, and a Europe of cooperation, and a Europe for peace, cannot precisely be achieved on the basis of the guidelines that this Commission proposes to follow.
From the point of view of both democracy and legitimacy, it is important to tell citizens what the EU is doing.
We Germans would not do justice to our national unity if we did not regard it as a contribution to European unity, which has followed historic events, which I have now briefly spoken about.
To put it plainly, one person is now doing the job of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
As I have said in this Chamber before, I stand before you as someone who very much wants to see a European Union that is composed of cooperating nations.
- Report: Elles
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained from voting in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
In addition, the compulsory nature of the register for all lobbyists who want to maintain permanent access to the premises of Parliament and the Commission is an important step towards greater transparency in relations between these organisations and the European institutions.
However, if we adopt everything at first reading, Parliament will weaken its own rights.
It is a very important step which will enable the fundamental rights of European citizens to be subject to more effective control.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on Mr Kirilov's report will take place in the next few weeks, which I welcome, because this is a very urgent matter.
Personally, I was not entirely convinced that this legislation would be necessary, because it is mainly companies that buy vans - small and large - that are already very well aware of the need for the economy and fuel efficiency.
I would like to propose an investigation into consolidated accounts.
(DE) Mr President, I would first of all like to make a general remark, and then two or three questions, depending on whether there is time available.
We must also remember that, if Turkey is in the European Union, countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria are at our borders.
In the end, I believe that we need to understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without continually bearing in mind employment change.
What would Europe expect?
Let us not forget that we are responsible for everything we do for our constituents, who are going through difficult times.
However, for the same reason, export credit agencies may be guilty of massive business distortion if their financial operations are not controlled by common rules.
I believe that good governance of the internal market can only be based on the quality and the validity of information about the functioning of the internal market.
In the current period of global economic crisis (that is, economic recession and rising unemployment), the reality on the European labour market is that more and more people are being made redundant, which will further increase the total number of people affected by poverty and exclusion in Europe.
Of course, the poultry was already there, as did my national anthem, but it was still necessary to set up a new state.
These are issues that are dealt with to a certain extent by corporate social responsibility, but they cannot be implemented without a national framework.
This is a real compromise.
In the event of an accident, appropriate operational assistance must also be guaranteed to give passengers the services and goods they need most.
The Council accepts this common text, and therefore the President of the European Parliament, can say that the budget has been definitively adopted.
In order to strengthen the EU resettlement programme, support must be given to the creation of private financing mechanisms, as well as the promotion of public and legal initiatives.

I also call on the Commission to take concrete steps and to take initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe.

The EU cannot just be the sum of 27 countries' national interests.
Now, Mr Reinfeldt will present us with a report on the activities of the last six months of the European Council.
The reverse side of tough measures, the fact that people who work hard are being made redundant from the public sector's jobs, must be turned into an increase in the number of new businesses, taking advantage of entrepreneurial lives and reducing the costs involved in setting up a company in order to achieve a lucrative private sector that is needed to top up the bottom of the Member States from this gap.
These two forces have been unable to create a common vision and, as a result, progress has been stalled.
Does this free trade agreement actually only apply to the current world and to the division of economic power between Europe and India, or is it appropriate in another ten or fifteen years' time?
The main objectives of the Radio spectrum programme are the availability of broadband connections throughout the EU by 2013, as well as rapid needing connections by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis, but is its main reason for failing to take immediate action when needed to tackle this crisis in the Republic of Moldova.
European workers and poor people must take these disastrous measures and support a genuinely democratic and socialist Europe, and that means opposing the actions of the new European Commission.
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Animal welfare standards have now been officially added to the European Union Treaty and must be taken into account when drafting policies in areas such as the internal market.
It is expressed mainly at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage, and it is an asset that must be taken into account and emphasised within the framework of regional development policy.

There are many mistakes, and only one on the backgrounds of those accused, the euro.
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have just described, I believe that we now have a solid foundation on which to develop our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research work under the framework programme.
Our debate is too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon this excellent report, which comes at a good time for strengthening these two continents.
That is why we are trying to significantly simplify European legislation.
Unfortunately, important amendments proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected, which is why initiatives cannot be signed by persons who are not nationals of a Member State who are not in the EU, thus preventing residents from participating on an equal footing regardless of nationality, and there is no guarantee that signatures will enter into a personal identification with the signatories.
I call for the establishment of an independent committee composed of local and international lawyers whose role is to examine the violent events that followed the elections and to raise the necessary complaints.
NATO and what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results achieved in Afghanistan.
This has gone too far and it must be concluded.
The drawing up of a guide for public and private operators and the development of an education and mobility programme in terms of how multi-level governance policy should be applied in practice could effectively contribute to the development of regional policy.
I hope that our Spanish and Italian fellow Members will join it, but we cannot leave it any longer, as the whole world is looking for innovation markets.

Mr President, the negotiations currently under way between the EU and Vietnam on a new partnership and cooperation agreement must also address human rights and civil liberties.
Without prejudice to the adoption of some of the important measures proposed in the report, I would like to draw attention to a key factor in the problem.
However, it is not the method that exposes the economy and jobs to the sphere of bureaucracy, unfair competition and unpredictable price volatility.
It does not have a detrimental effect on the cod, because very little is currently being done at the moment in vain as the fridges.
The sanctions proposed are proportionate and necessary, and it is desirable that they prevent unfair commercial practices by commercial operators.
I believe that this argument is excessive and discriminatory, because, for example, in Portugal, the majority of families of this kind live in protected rural areas.

As a result, ODA and new funding are needed.
The ethical evaluation of work carried out within the framework of this project has achieved a positive result, which has been confirmed.

Above all, the rapporteur regrets that citizens do not know the rights that it would give them.
The creation of an area of security, justice and freedom in the European Union is a crucial and definite example for all of us of the European democratic model that we are building, and many of us regard Europol as an instrument to be able to adapt, but we all very much appreciate the fact that resources - not least human resources, but also the combination of organised and technical resources for combating all forms of trafficking - would be closely monitored, and thus the greatest possible European citizens' rights to be equipped with the greatest possible legal certainty.
That is why it is important to adopt all sorts of measures to strengthen the transparency and independence of impact assessments, which will help maximise the role of this instrument in supporting the decision-making process and ensure the quality and suitability of the functioning of the European institutions.
My second point is that this strategy should strengthen cohesion within the EU, in other words, its convergence.
By the way, it is not the direction in which the Commission was moving, because its proposal focused - the regulation adopted by this House - on reforming the current system of private agencies and on strengthening transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest and honesty in their work on rating agencies.
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of setting up a European Credit Rating Foundation completely independent.
Even before the current crisis, social difficulties existed in the countries of the European Union due to weak economic growth, the complex demographic situation and the difficulties that exist in the increasingly global economy.
Part influence, however, is, to some extent, worrying, with regard to the danger of a slowing down in the enthusiasm of the Moldovans.
We in this House have always been strong in defending the autonomy of the Tibetan people, which is not automatically about self-determination or the right to independence.

These costs still leave room for some derogations if they are demanded by Member States with good reason.
This framework decision should not lead to excessive administrative burdens in cases where problems can easily be tackled using more suitable alternatives.
The ECB did not see a major crisis coming, and it did not really lock it with a regulation that is far from perfect.
However, a serious organisation should be better prepared by the European Union for such situations and, in particular, ready to react effectively in the event of an emergency.
- Kaczmarek report
This should only be supported if the measures do not produce a result.
I committed myself to reporting to the European institutions this citizens' protest.
The EU and industrialised countries should adopt the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 25% and 40% by 2020 and the long-term target of an 80% reduction by 2050 compared with 1990.
- Report: Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to clarify two important points which have been raised several times during the debate.

With its very strong vote, the Irish people have given us the spirit and strength to continue to consolidate and to build a strong and, above all, a federal Europe.
Although environmental protection and the protection of public health are interconnected, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
That is a problem that we need to resolve together.
We need to work together with large consumer countries such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan to establish a global system of warning and illegal logging, using the most recent satellite technology systems.
Of course, we cannot give short-term support to the sector to weaken its competitiveness in the long term.
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity.

This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to say that I believe that this subject is too important for us to be able to continue living in the lies in which Europe has been alive.
Of course, as has already been pointed out, we did not know the names of the candidates and we did not have a female candidate, even though, for the sake of honesty, Commissioner Barnier explained it appropriately.
We regret the low turnout in the European elections and the'no' votes in referendums.
Mr Coelho, we need to look at what is happening correctly and we will inform you then.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements cover a broad spectrum of provisions, and the observations, whether they be purposeful or unintended, may result in competition being lost.
We also need a common European asylum system that is more effective and more protective.
That concludes Question Time.

This was described by the same horror in its country as Guernica seven decades ago, when the June Lisndors in Legión disappeared at the level of Guernica.
In this regard, it can be said that speculators, too, are trying to speculate in a bad economic situation and sometimes are making it worse.
José Bové is absolutely right and Hynek Fajmon...
Not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale and organic farming and local values, which ensure the diversity of agriculture throughout Europe, must be promoted.
Mr Rapkay's report on the amendment of the Staff Regulations in connection with the establishment of the EEAS is a very important document on its path towards the creation of a Union foreign policy.

Mr President, a few weeks ago, I had the honour of chairing a delegation from the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, which attended the Seventh World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference in Geneva.

I have asked Member States to put forward names, including women.
The first is that it is important to maintain the geographical distribution of financial assistance from the EU budget between the countries of the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe, in accordance with the financial perspective for 2007-2013, and it is also important to continue providing support to these countries, in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.
We consider Kosovo to be an exception case and we would point out that it has not been recognised by Spain and by four other Member States.
There are sufficient reasons to exclude Alexander Lukashenko from the EU summit, in accordance with the appeals from the Belarusian opposition.
Our policy of underlining the current humanist and global elements is a very important approach, even if it then concerns the internal market.
Mr President, I would like to support the positions of other colleagues on the rights of people with disabilities and what Mr Kadenbach said about children and what was said about the issue of the protection of hotels and, in particular, about the safe operation of sprinklermen in all EU hotels, as well as about the need for the new proposal to be appropriate for the future.
I was going to ask about gender balance in the Commission, so this is a good opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment.
It is clear from the report that the Member States have exclusive competence in defence and national security, which we would like to emphasise.
Similarly, Member States with the greatest concern about the accumulation of funds and the secret sections were those whose limit values were lower than those and which did not publish price reserve contracts.
I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen Accord has a reference to the level of ambition needed to address climate change in the post-2012 climate agreement, and lays the foundations for the financial package and calls for serious commitments to reduce emissions.
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis still require some 4 million lives every year.
With regard to trade more closely, I ask the Commissioner for a guarantee that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) will not be used to prevent the sale of available medicines at more competitive prices - I am thinking of safe generic medicines that do not infringe intellectual property rights, the only crime associated with them being produced in emerging economies such as India and Brazil, and may export markets from the West industry.
After all, Members have the right to say.
That is unacceptable.
We want to be involved in this.
We therefore need to find proportionate financial and technical compensation.
In this area, too, we need to take decisive action in the context of competition and consumer protection policy.
It is also contemptible that the same politicians require us to accept the result of the second referendum, even though they did not actually accept the result of the first vote.
in writing. - (PL) As the author of one motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on Kyrgyzstan, I would like to thank my fellow Members who voted in favour of this document today.

The Heads of State or Government also emphasised that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union and that we must ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests.

The Commission is currently working on a more systematic assessment of the quality of development of public finances, including aspects of the result-based budget.
I regard this as a priority as Commissioner for Trade.
The Commission will therefore be able to submit revised or new proposals depending on the situation.
The United States must introduce clear, transparent criteria on the basis of which it imposes a visa requirement in certain Member States.
The issue of funding remains open.
For the rest of this House, let me say that constructive criticism of Turkey is needed; we are self-criticised friends.

I repeat: not in any way.
Particularly in the run-up to Copenhagen, it is also important for the EU and other international players to declare their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development aid.
I would like to refer to Commissioner Rehn, who I personally appreciate, when he says that Nigeria is a very poor country, and that is not true, because Nigeria is a very rich country, but the problem is corruption and the incomparable decision makers who have robbed the country of natural resources and have left millions of citizens at the centre of poverty.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, I would like to tell you that you are not so pessimistic.
I therefore call on the Commission to state without delay Parliament's position on the new proposal so that ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010, and I call on the Commission to ensure that non-ACP producers and exporters are reciprocally complying with social and environmental standards.
This calls on the Commission, as a coordinator of the Energy Community, to take on and remind Ukraine of its responsibilities in relation to the security of European supply.
in writing. - We naturally regret all the victims of aggressive and authoritarian regimes, whether or not they have been committed in Europe or, for example, in the former colonies of Europe.
The main objective of the regulation must be to establish a new culture of shared control and responsibility, and not to develop a bureaucratic and costly process to check every product.

In the case of transport, much more needs to be done to put pressure on manufacturers to develop vehicles that consume less fuel.
in writing. - (ET) The economic situation of some of the countries in the euro area that have been dealt with today clearly illustrates the risks posed by a distance from the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I therefore believe that it would be very reasonable to see how best we could use the funds saved in order to expand the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery, so that a new, obviously necessary financial instrument can be introduced to support energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives.
Both the Commission and Parliament have deliberately chosen not to address the entire issue of fund processing, because we are leaving behind the assumption that the sector will keep its promise to deal with the matter on its own, with no legal pressure.
This will serve as a catalyst for two issues concerning Europe 2020.
(EL) Mr President, with regard to the manufacturing industry, I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is the world's fourth largest cotton producer, accounting for 9% of global production, and the European Union, which now represents a share of a little below 5.5%.
The Council, and above all the European Parliament, are also involved in deciding on the composition and the portfolios of the College of Commissioners that you share, and on the programme for the next five years that you are presenting.
We need to understand that this process has lasted only a year and that we should tighten the pace in 2009.

Many public doctors apparently start to call for dementia to be too late to prevent the budget from exceeding, which goes against themselves.
Paradoxically, this instrument could easily be misused in practice, and not only by extremists, but also by very strong and influential interest groups, and I say this because we believe that the threshold of one million support is not a big village when compared to the population potential of the Union.
The 2010 budget introduces such a systematic approach.
According to the report of the UN task force, victims of trafficking have different social backgrounds: the most wealthy among the poorest, the most educated, fully qualified, small children are more elderly women.

We need to increase and improve European economic governance, and national action must support this line, and we need a tax on financial transactions, which I call on the Commission to consider very carefully at European level as well.
I think that mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important, because it is not only about health, but also about after-sales, but we still have time to resolve this detail.
I would first of all like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for their reports on important issues concerning the contribution of the European Union to achieving key policy objectives: human rights, the pursuit of economic prosperity and social justice, the achievement of sustainable growth, and respect for the environment, and in particular for the climate.
Consumers will be able to resort to a number of protective measures if they purchase a product that is not in line with the agreement, and they are also entitled to claim compensation if a solution is not provided.

Thanks to this new and intelligent symmetric system, stricter supervision, the Commission, Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank will make more thorough assessments of additional reforms and corrective plans.

(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union returned to growth in the third quarter of 2009, which could make us believe that the worst is behind us.
In this context, a broad programme of structural reforms is expected to be adopted by Greece, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of public administration, speeding up pension and healthcare reform, improving the viability of the labour market and the effectiveness of the pay negotiations system, improving the operation of the product market and the business environment, as well as maintaining banking and financial stability.
We believe that when concluding agreements between independent countries, it is essential to mention the following: respect for the sovereignty of the country and its citizens, the common interest, reciprocity and respect for the specific features of each country, and the assessment of what each country brings to an agreement from an economic, social and cultural point of view.
I believe that the transition towards a sustainable green economy will also be successful without imposing over-the-top legislative measures.
Everyone seems to be forgetting the efforts of the United States and, of course, NATO to promote peace in Europe.
I believe that we should see this as an opportunity to respond to what Europe desperately needs: economic growth, employment, dynamic small businesses, more innovation, more efficient public procurement, and our citizens are assessing us on the basis of these considerations.
I do not think it is up to us to predict the possible development of these countries.
The second project concerns concessions.
Mr President, during the elections to the European Parliament in 2004, a ban on smoking was introduced in the workplace, which is why we were faced with a large number of hate voters outside restaurants and books.
In fact, at a time when state intervention involves deep disappearance, increasing the EU budget shows confidence in the common project and strengthens the action taken at supranational level.
I know we have a good message, so it should be disseminated.
The report contains instructions as to how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and what procedures should be applied.
The language law causes imbalance.
Perhaps when the Treaty of Lisbon finally enters into force on 1 December, the internal British policy can also be excluded from this Chamber.

In addition, we support the need for the full involvement of each national parliament, in accordance with its budgetary and supervisory rights, in order to increase the transparency and accountability of the decisions taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, five plus questions have been asked regarding economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy.
I therefore believe that we should actively involve the national authorities, the European Commission and Members of this House in promoting SOLVIT.
This system is based on real policies and guidelines, as well as on - and - attention, Mr Michel - leading figures and liberal rhetoric, which have caused the current situation: the promotion of an agricultural model in the interests of large agricultural and food companies, as a result of which the quality of world agriculture is deteriorating, and on the fact that investments in poor, agricultural output and medium-sized farms in the world have been promoted for many years.
Economically: producers are paying less than their production costs, and the CAP must make it possible to solve this problem.
I would again like to call on the Commission, when this is in contact with the government, to put pressure on that promise to be fulfilled until the law is coming together in Congo.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I fully understand that the European Parliament is following with great interest the measures that are being taken both within and outside the Union in order to overcome the difficulties affecting public finances in some Member States.
We sympathise with those people who want a better life, a better chance of influence and a better tomorrow.

The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the evaluation of horizontal cooperation rules in the field of competition - B7-0565/2010).
You fought for this together, whether it is the blue or the orange.
I believe that this procedure and strengthening the food safety of EU citizens will ensure clarity and transparency, not only for Member States, but also for third countries exporting these products to the EU.
In view of this, it seems nonsense to us to try to reach agreement with the Mercosur countries, especially after the Swedish Food and biotechnology Institute demonstrated that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be up to 35 times as much as that of Irish beef.
Therefore, as agreed with the Council, the following text, which is Article 1 (2) (b) (b) of Article 1 (a) of the original regulation, should be added, and'the same reference rates will apply to the revision of payments in Article 4 and 4 (a) as well as the annual review of payments under Article 6 (3) if these payments are expressed as a non-euro'.
Now the Irish Government has withdrawn and rightly gained European solidarity.
Let us look at Ireland, which was particularly hard hit by the financial crisis, and its membership in the monetary union protected it from a much larger crisis.
He fears the Germans to demand the Sudeten Regions, and having listened to the speeches of German politicians about this, I think she is quite rightly afraid of this.
an increase in support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund and more financial support for technical activities related to the preparation and implementation of projects;

In the same way, it is up to each Member State to sign or ratify the framework convention for the protection of national minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are two important documents presented by the Council of the European Union.
We can therefore exchange views on issues that are of concern to us in a structured dialogue.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability: people with jobs already have access to security and support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and do not have to retrain and improve their skills for one or two years to get to work; it is about maintaining existing jobs.
Mr President, the purpose of our questions is that our fellow citizens can understand the benefits they will gain from such a package and what we can offer with this package.
I voted in favour of this report, which also completes the European Commission's proposal with a few significant improvements, in particular, concerning data protection for individuals.
In addition, we have carried out an amendment in 2009 on unused funds in order to introduce an additional EUR 1.9 billion earmarked for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for your very clear message.
We can see something about this, as well as the fact that efforts have been made to adopt a holistic approach in your work, but this has not been the case, as we expected, but it is nevertheless on the right road.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes lenient, and the Council with which we tried to find a sensible solution at night and at various trialogue meetings, because only hour ago adopted the sensible compromise that we reached.
In order to ensure substantial and coordinated action, the Commission established, together with the European Aviation Supervisory Organisation, a European Crisis Coordination Centre for Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010.

I come from a country, Portugal, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important, and where it has focused on regions that are socially sensitive and where maintaining the quota system after 2015 would, in fact, be crucial.

Political parties can be banned, there is corruption, there is a violation of human rights, there is no freedom of expression and freedom of association in the same way as in countries as Britain or most other EU countries.
Of course, it is also clear that we need as wide a'energy mix' as possible, namely different energy sources, because it stabilises energy independence and brings about the diversity of each nation and of Europe's own rights.
However, I have doubts when Parliament calls for certain disgusting practices in international law, even though the legal basis for this is anything but clear.
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic and democratic revolution that it embarks on.
Furthermore, Parliament calls on Member States to take appropriate measures and effective policies such as national action plans or targeted social measures, as well as regularly reporting on their actions aimed at resolving this issue.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, allow me to make some comments directly on the points and questions that I have been asked.
Last week, at committee meeting, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a challenging chair.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the continued violations of human rights in the country, particularly freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and freedom of association, and because I support the aspirations of the Iranian people for democracy.

In addition, the private aspect of tourism improves the image of the European Union and promotes European citizenship.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today aims to amend the regulation of 2004, which improved and harmonised security provisions relating to the protection of European citizens' passports and travel documents against abuse, while at the same time introducing elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, some institutional framework must be created for the implementation mechanism for decisions.
What is positive is that some of the agreements that we have recently concluded are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
It is therefore important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade understands that its current approach to constructive cooperation with the European Union is much more effective than trying to write history again and again.
It seems strange to hear that, so far, the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments, nor time to bring the Latvian Government to an end discrimination on the basis of this language.
For this reason, I call on the Council and the Commission to combine all assistance to the government of Pakistan with the urgent end of the destructive discrimination of religious minorities.

It is acceptable and justified, and we have fought for it.

The main objective of aid for the development of trade is to improve the national and international competitiveness of these 48 countries.
Although it would make sense to have a starting point for the internalisation of external costs, it is fundamentally intolerable that only heavy goods vehicles can suffer from the goal of facilitating traffic congestion, just as the old'polluter pays' principle is clearly applied in a discriminatory way.
I am encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate.
In addition, if we look at the starting position, we have some concerns.
The European Union and its governments, be they centre-right or centre left, have to safeguard the profitability of monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union.

That is why the Commission must play a strong role.
We cannot intervene where the US Government has exclusive competence.
We are looking to people in charge of care very little if there is any provision for these hidden activities, which many see as self-sufficiency.
Unfortunately, it must also be said that the list of outstanding problems seems to be dragging on, not shortening.

There are large dealers, who are very much present in the markets of some Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are more pleased with what we are currently proposing, rather than with what has been in place since 2002, because certain aspects that the legislator did not mean in 2002 have been in their interests, but rather have made it more difficult for them to compete with large dealers.

Despite all the characteristics of health, it is within the scope of the Treaty on European Union.
However, I would like to warn Parliament that the recent study of the European Geogological Monitics (European Society for Cardiology) has once again shown that there are serious limitations to the method, as women are involved little in these tests.
The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but also that they must not prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives.

It is very inconceivable that Orthodox priests, spies and Patriarchaes must be Turkish citizens.
The most important point of the position adopted by Parliament is the attention it pays to the decentralisation of measures, which will therefore allow them to interfere with unity in terms of both legislative poorer and their implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least the question of the single digital market has been raised among the EU's priorities.

This is a huge challenge for me and a great honour.
If we are honest, our historic responsibility for climate change must be acknowledged, and our emissions per capita are still multilingual, compared, for example, with China and India.
I am sure that the dialogue that has resulted from it will be constructive.
That is why we regret the urgency of the urgency with regard to Europol as well as the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms.
I support the Commission's proposal, which aims to introduce a new, simpler method for using funds from the European Social Fund to ensure that it can respond more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties faced by the EU.

I think we need to take care of the impartiality of the EU's humanitarian aid, which is sometimes difficult in crisis regions.
In addition to the new aspects that Parliament has already raised in the past, as called on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to evaluate the results of the investigations carried out by all the parties and to report to the European Parliament on those assessments, it reminds us that, in the name of responsibility and credibility, the implementation of the reports is fully controlled, including the Goldstone activities carried out by the EU and their observatory activities.

The number of new infections still exceeds the number of people who have access to care, and in 2009, two thirds of people in need of care still had access to care, which means that 10 million people in need of care did not have the effective treatment they need.
When human dignity is upheld, in fact we see no minorities at all.
I support the Commission's proposals to simplify the Fund.
In future, all the European institutions should ensure that our budgets are aimed at helping people and businesses cope with economically difficult times and at planning recovery.
The fastest way to make them conditional on citizens' initiatives and on the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions, which is much more effective and pragmatic than what is downward.
For all those who continue to fight this agreement in the mistrust that it is an agreement to strengthen the European Union, I would say: those who fight against this agreement actually strengthen our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents.

We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will push for the development of a network of other modes of transport.

Sri Lanka's economic recovery depends on foreign direct investment and EU financial support.

The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.

The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Mr President, my question relates to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of every proposal, and whether a prior study should be carried out in the relevant region taking into account Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific characteristics of this region, so that every country must take into account certain criteria from the outset and comply with them in planning.

Mr President, I think that the European Union has become far too big and far too multicultural; I simply do not have any confidence in this system and will get worse.
It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis and, as the honourable Member knows, each step in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to point out that the prospect of integration into the EU is the strongest incentive for the countries of the Balkans to implement the necessary reforms and also a factor for stability in the region.

All those taking decisions in this area should have equal access to expert information about the country of origin and bodies to which decisions can be brought to complain, and the same must also be the case with asylum seekers.

Together, we have achieved something.
In addition, during this parliamentary term, we intend to work on services of general interest.
I would therefore like to propose that we turn to some countries, for example, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Joaquín Almunia, who, during his term, was rather critical of certain countries, and then the Greek crisis broke out.
In this regard, reforms are really needed in Turkey.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU Member States, particularly Portugal and Spain, so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania.
