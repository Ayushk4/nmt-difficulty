Closure of sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in its global response to the global crisis .
The report &apos;s conclusions debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament show us that the importation of agricultural products from third countries has a much greater negative impact on the environment than internal production , subject to stricter carbon dioxide reduction rules favouring climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that the countries to which these funds are allocated cannot use .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
Maritime institutions in the Member States must cooperate much more closely both to harmonise their curricula and to offer opportunities for staggering and exchanging experiences paid to European navigation companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we have seen is that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers .
Frontex must be supported , and the EU must also oblige the authorities of the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
I would like to raise one issue that no one has yet addressed except Commissioner Almunia .
in writing . - The sensitive areas of climate change are mainly : water , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity and , last but not least , the population &apos;s health .
Let me express my personal grief and the Commission for the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a jandarm as a result of last week &apos;s terrorist attacks .
Mr Piebalgs , congratulations on all your work .
However , it is encouraging that , following the opposition and concern expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education regarding the degradation of policies on training and training , especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and is causing problems in numerous Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments - which I supported - by increasing the planned appropriations ( for example in the case of Article 1502 ) on the Lifelong Learning Programme .
A minority government of completely different political orientation then took over power , but no one found this a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , as the international community , have seen the problem of Abyei unresolved in the referendum is , in fact , very irresponsible and it is a prescription for the breaking of the war in the future .
The case of the Romanian Korean Handez Cozma , killed with a festified two representatives of the Roma community in Hungary , shows once again that crime has no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive .
We need to have a strong food policy in the EU .
The Treaty of Lisbon must be a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to compose the resources of the Member States , in order to achieve optimal results and in cooperating on common strategies and operations that will make Europe the political union dreams years ago .
That is what we are making .
We all support the single market , as Hungary did from the outset .
The avoidance of climate change forces society and the European Union &apos;s economy to evoke themselves into a new reality .
Every country will continue to promote internal stability and help to find socio-economic solutions and find solutions to ethnic tensions .
It has been a formidable three-year link and , like most of the amorous short-term ties , I am pleased to see that it is coming to an end .
The need to maintain the continued vigilance of NATO and its support , especially in Afghanistan today , is essential .
But something needs to happen and we need to get things moving .
In this respect , common issues , such as reduced VAT rates , system derogations , the opportunity to set up the maximum rate and , last but not least , the place of taxation on deliveries to the EU .
Allow me to tell you about the West Midlands region : we have the highest rate of unemployment among young people and our car industry has been decimated , partly because of the EU &apos;s funding activities of Slovakia , which have kidnapped jobs essential to the Ryton plant .
It is essential to ensure that these new institutions are not cowed to weaken or undermine the rules that are important for reforming the financial sector .
Enough is enough !
We must also facilitate the creation of a research centre network that can share specialised infrastructure and change information and useful data .
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of creating the Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries , especially in Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating all the time .
Mr Severin has noted very well strategic reciprocity , as Europe needs strong United States and the US , too , need a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this flow of refugees will mean in relation to the proportion that can be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that , in the near future , the Canadian authorities will make every effort to abolish these visas .
Finally , not a food inspector or or or or or or or or or or or or or or of an EU food safety agency has made the discovery discovery , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we should use our vision of the capacity of the militia , with the emphasis on the soft power and prevention to address a new work programme , one that has already existed , but which has become clearer at Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter a new era of disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure this evening to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been drafted in the Committee on Budgets for some time .
In September , members of the moderate democrats party did not vote in favour of appointing Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , his past being unable to recommend his re-election .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that animal welfare is promoted , that animals live in suitable conditions for their species and are sound and robust , following the principle that prevention is better than treatment .
Now we fear that , if the scope of the directive is extended , it will have exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking , in other words , that it will be blocked again at the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to endorse the proposal by my fellow Members for politicians , Member States and the EU to put SMEs at the heart of their efforts at economic recovery .
Countries like Britain and the US , both with deficits exceeding 10 % , will have to make significant adjustments to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep matters separate , otherwise the Latvian Prime Minister will have to comment on the new Hungarian media law and I do not think it is his responsibility .
Clearly , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from the island to viticula that follows on from a quality policy , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise an underproduce by mixing finished products and to allow misleading references to rosé colour .
But there is a great deal more to do .
The pursuit will be job losses across rural Europe and reduce our food production capacity .
Let us also remember that , apart from these institutional matters , the current Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - are , of course , highly influenced by the need to move on to the issue of climate change , to the issue of the financial crisis , to the need for Europe to have a policy of job creation - many important issues that need to be addressed .
I would , however , like to point out that we are aware that we will have to establish a new basis for a series of texts necessary for judicial and police cooperation , thereby enabling Parliament to exercise its office as colegislator .
I would also like to applaud the rapporteurs for excluding the ethical element , which will naturally fall within the Member States &apos; sphere of responsibility .
This is a good thing , because it is young people who ultimately decide the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must also remember those who have already contributed significantly to the building of Europe .
In other words , we are devising an economic recovery plan in which we are granting three and a half billion the oligarchies of energy giants and not a single euro to the partners we need to engage in the switch to green energy .
Fish quotas and the management of stocks are essential for preventing overfishing in inland and oce-fishing waters .
We would have preferred to have seen Parliament &apos;s resources increased by redistribution and measures to increase efficiency , not by increasing the total budget .
Furthermore , this package can show how the European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , efficient and constructive manner in such an important area .
I believe that an approach based on the initial effort ( &apos; frontloading &apos; ) , as recommended by the Commission in its recast proposal , in other words , improving the quality of first-instance decisions , will allow us to make real medium-term split economies .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and managed to reach agreement at first reading on the regulation on animal by-products .
We do not want to externalise European jobs in countries that do not have the same level of environmental standards as we have here .
All contributions were useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly worsening .
A lot of work needs to be done between the 27 Member States to reflect Europe &apos;s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and defend the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament for democracy and human rights , and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , money was only intended for two types of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) and wind farms in the North Sea .
If the EGF funds were proposed to be allocated to redundant workers in the UK , we would be voting for this allocation and we would be criticised if we did not do so .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that it is fully operational , but it is still on track .
This concerns our neighbours and includes the closest , like Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as the most remote , such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Together with my colleagues in the Commission , we are very committed to including the principle of equality between women and men in all the policies that we will be presenting .
These projects will lead to an end to differences in connection between the European Union &apos;s systems and will make it possible to make the best use of the energy sources that the European Union has .
What is more , this is a political approach , and I think that Europe needs above all more policy , and that is certainly one of the rewards of our Parliament .
There is also the problem of FIFA &apos;s failure to introduce empty technology while other sporting has done so .
After all , we have the opportunity to organise different types of training or workshops , where we can provide real help with access to EU funds intended for the development of rural areas .
Others use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral actions with suppliers who often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
I also welcome the fact that we have succeeded in creating a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
In particular , many Member States have made considerable efforts to fulfil their obligations on this Pact .
The aim is to allow the EU to respond to the major social challenges that concern the Member States and cannot respond alone ( ageing people and health , energy , water and food supply , sustainable development , climate change , etc . ) , as well as to develop knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate further and increase their competitiveness .
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow , I think there are a few shortcomings in this budget and I would like to highlight two of the important ones .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will then move on to the key issues for the global economy , in particular , financial regulations and timely monitoring of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to look at this in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide assistance to workers suffering as a result of major structural changes in world trade practices and to help them reintegrate into the labour market .
The background to the problem lies in the desire of Europeans to stop accepting the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would necessarily result from accession .
This is a difficult role , a lack of satisfaction .
This is even at the top of our priority list .
But EU support is essential for guaranteeing the independence of that country .
The Israeli Government is continuing the settlements in force , and this is after having committed war crimes at the beginning of this year .
The additional evaluations and visits made by teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has the five long-liner vessels to the surface .
increasing budgets in these areas and creating new military capabilities which will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would also like to highlight the contradiction between the commitment made by the government of Pakistan to religious freedom and the leading role it plays in the organisation of Islamic states to support the &apos; Combating Religion &apos; agenda in front of the United Nations .
I stress this today afternoon , because it is my sincere opinion .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , because it guarantees both equality of rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , rapid and coordinated intervention by governments and European institutions is absolutely necessary ( programmes for returning old cars to a consistent reduction in the purchase of a new one , financial aid , etc . ) .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is right , but it does not seem to be very consistent than the significance of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , when the functions and powers shared between the two pillars are to be strengthened .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , that is the question &apos; .
This policy is intended for failure if those people working in the fishing industry , from fishermen to traders who sell consumer fish , do not comply with the regulations .
The costly and inefficient spoken of Parliament , the masquerade of democracy , the monstrous way in which those who sent us here are deceived .
This is an unfortunate situation , because it would appear that we should join our efforts on this issue .
We have stopped saying that trade liberalisation and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe , which is something that we are not interested in because the climate issue must take priority .
The task of debt - painful proof of the situation we are witnessing - hinders economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
At the same time , this report will help clarify the various aviation agreements and simplify their processing , by mentioning what criteria we must pay attention to and what aspects we must follow .
I will vote for the telecoms package , but I will do so with a certain retention , because I believe that there has been fundamental betrayal at the highest level of the basic principle of the liberalisation of telecommunications that this directive is supposed to achieve .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
They will have a major impact and generate lower costs for taxpayers if we succeed in coordinating our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to simplify the procedure for obtaining EU visas by Belarusians and a readmission agreement .
Let me give you a concrete example .
Take the example of educating children and schools .
Nor do we yet know whether the standards that we promote in the legal trade in timber will come into force and work globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this issue .
The setting up of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by Member States to support sustainable quality growth is crucial .
in writing . - I voted for the amendment to the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow vaccines to be used more effectively and reduce bureaucracy for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report insofar as it launches a call to shape strong and integrated EU policies .
In view of this , I would like to express my deepest disappointment at the results of the meeting , which was far below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payment leads to difficulties , both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , no one disputes this , but we should not insist that citizens make every effort because they are our only chance of emerging from this crisis .
In the United States , there is a system of early warning for this purpose .
One of these cases is that of one of my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy .
Let us speed things up : this was what the Europeans asked for , expressed at the time of the European Parliament elections , and this must be our answer if , in five years &apos; time , they are to be better .
The parts of the text for which the European Council is competent have been discussed and accepted by the European Council itself .
The expenditure on final private consumption per capita has increased by more than 80 % over the last ten years .
At this point , I think it is useful to start thinking seriously about suitable ways of enforcing existing legislation .
The conclusions of the meeting on this are very vague .
To this end , the proposal provides uniform instruments to facilitate precautionary or enforcement measures in order to avoid problems related to the recognition and translation of acts issued by other Member States and a form for notification of claims on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget as important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes for cooperation at European level .
For example , the Council &apos;s decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 provided for the Member States &apos; ability to cooperate nationally , intergovernmental , for the criminal prosecution of these crimes , which - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - are , fortunately , even included in the legislation of certain Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen either as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; combined subsidies &apos; .
Decisions are increasingly distance , and the Internet has now totally changed our habits , partly because our lives have become much more common .
As far as information is concerned , we always provide information as we receive it .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is being made in the education of the new generation , and I mean lifelong education .
We would like the death penalty not to apply anywhere else .
I am pleased that these problems have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , there are thousands of people involved , often with small children and without adequate funding .
Procedures are completely different when it comes to appealing to the Commission on the basis of the possible future treaty and the use of Parliament under the petitions procedure .
Human rights must be respected by all sides of the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all need to assume our responsibilities .
In any case , we understand that UNESCO has made statements to the Chinese authorities regarding the impact of development on Kashgar &apos;s traditional heritage and culture .
in writing . - MEP Schwab has proposed a report that intends to increase the safety of motor vehicles by introducing higher safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown our ability to act and have strengthened our resilience .
If we talk about Parliament &apos;s position on external bodies , for example on human rights organisations that could be affected by this , and if we fail to reach an agreement , although I hope it will not be the case , and some individual projects cannot take place , then I think there is support and understanding for Parliament &apos;s position .
These Thursday afternoon sittings take increasingly surreal turnout in this House , both in terms of the lack of content that we see and in terms of the issues we are dealing with and how they are treated .
I believe that it remains completely unclear whether Moldova will manage to elect a president , and if this does not happen , a new election will take place next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 , with 11 EU Member States adopting the single currency on the same date .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome the current compromise , because it raises the issue of the democratic deficits faced by women for years , in particular , when it helps spouses who have been involved in self-employed trade , meusurised , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , without any recognition , over time , of their work .
Of course , our political choices are clearly different and sometimes divergent .
I would call this climate justice because it concerns the relationship between developing and developed countries , as well as the will to present a credible proposal for financing countermeasures and adaptation measures , and how we are showing our willingness to open the way .
I would therefore like to know the Commission &apos;s position on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid granted to the banks , which have made use of aid , but did not take the appropriate social approach .
Not only do I have three children , but I also have a net which currently only has milk .
We are ready to develop technical assistance programmes to accompany the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities have to take .
We expect the Commission to develop it .
As you said , we need to keep up our statistics all the time and Eurostat is looking at this .
Sometimes I wonder whether we have not learnt enough from the experience of the consequences of our actions , unless we follow European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific , even if we have to deal with a situation collectively .
Emails also show that scientists who have been sceptical of this hypothesis have been excluded from peer review processes so as to avoid errors in research reaching the public &apos;s doors .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
The Internet has shed light on this very dark part of society , which we are struggling with , which we are struggling with .
We know what kind of people we are dealing with here , so institutions have to be aware of inspections , of the fact that they pose a higher risk , and they therefore have to be subject to stricter inspections .
Our priority during the work on revising the RoHS Directive was to raise the level of safety of the rules applicable to electrical appliances and electronic gambling available for sale in the European Union .
Prevention work is especially being done in schools , because this social group is the most vulnerable to dependence .
The EU has developed successfully in order to bring together the continent at the end of the Cold War , and now it is called upon to conserve previous successes and to continue integration as soon as times come more precious .
Many Members want to answer their questions this evening and , out of respect for them , we want to conduct this process in an ordered manner .
But those of us who were involved in this problem knew that there was no alternative , that the dairy farming and dairy farming problems need to be resolved , and we hope that we are now on the verge of resolving some of the problems that some of the sector has faced .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provisions , we have chosen to abstain from such references in this report , because we oppose any family policy that is dictated at EU level ; this is a matter for national governments to decide on .
Last but not least , I believe that the following debates on this issue must address the issue of the EUBAM Rafah mission : how to resume this mission and how it can perhaps be extended .
Therefore , the Commission monitors the situation and , if necessary , the Commission will take action , but I believe that we must not overcome the structures in Community legislation and the Commission will certainly remain within the framework of Community legislation .
As our common desire is to see a genuine European diplomatic service that is not simply a supplement to the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we will be discussing today and voting on tomorrow , are of paramount importance .
in writing . - In the light of the persistent distance between men and women in respect of the employment rate , wages and access to top positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC while ensuring that its provisions are fully transposed and effectively transposed into national legislation .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I want to try and get the Commissioner promise that no further progress will be made in the next few weeks , until these fugitives are handed over .
We will address this issue very soon in the discussions about reshaping the railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The European Parliament today adopted , on Thursday 20 October , the report by its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already a discussion of tax increases in the near future to maintain public finances on the firing line .
Today , the time has come to make us better heard in our demands so that Christians and others are free to practise their religion .
At European level , 31.5 % of women work part-time ( 30 hours a week or less ) compared with only 8.3 % of men .
I share the cautious optimism of a member of the committee and of the Minister , and I think the sky is running out , but there are still many clouds left .
At the time , few of us would have assumed the proportions of the economic crisis to come .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction , showing that it is on the side of the consumer .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
This policy has become an essential element of the economic recovery package , generating added value and supporting modernisation and sustainable economic growth efforts , while demonstrating European solidarity .
It is also regrettable that we still do not know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force , and we clearly need to bring it into force without further reservations .
However , I believe that the situation clearly demonstrates the desperate situation of the agricultural industry , certainly in my region , if farmers have to sit outside , during the winter , in a bid to secure their modest amounts from EU funding .
The southern European Member States have postponed them far too much .
This should be done by applying smart , sustainable and inclusive economic growth in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will be expressing our will in a democratic vote , so tomorrow is very important .
It must be said that access to housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in the modern social state .
In my opinion , the definition of political priorities means that these should be considered , transparent and democratic .
This special project is about launching the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , a climate of horror has been established in the Voievina region of northern Serbia among the various nationalities living there , mainly Hungarians .
What we are about to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I do understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved a result that is applicable and feasible on our behalf .
in writing . - Although we agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for equal treatment for Parliament and the Council in terms of access to meetings and information , a regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives , impact assessments and the use of &apos; fur law &apos; ( rather than punitive law ) , we do not agree with : the reaffirmation and strengthening of binding deadlines for the implementation of directives and the use of the European Union .
You all know that there can be no broadcasting without access to the radio spectrum , and the aim of EU policy is to ensure that all market players have non-discriminatory access to the radio spectrum .
This will provide us with a general and relatively complex framework of action provided by the Commission for progress on equality between men and women in the areas that my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to other ways in which it is important to ensure and guarantee this equality .
We look forward to other and hard-pressed political parties putting offers on the table , which has so far not happened in a few cases .
Dementia , and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular , are not only serious medical problems , but also an extremely sensitive ethical and social problem , the seriousness of which will continue to increase in the context of an ageing European population .
I would also like to say that you have taken great care to point out that we must not confuse the different responsibilities and , of course , I do not want to interfere with the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , let me begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs , who have tackled all the details of this topic : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have extended their hand and , with the full support of all the European institutions , I ask Minsk to receive our help , because you and the Belarusian people have a lot to gain from it .
We need to monitor what is happening very carefully , because the President said that we could save EUR 38 billion annually on European companies .
Now , after a sentence against Liu Xiaobo , we have seen how the police prohibited gay oil , which clearly shows that a ice age is being approached for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today was very clear .
We must emphasise that this will only be possible by involving the parliaments , because it is only with their help that the majority of the regulations can be adapted properly , and that this process , as well as proposals for the transatlantic dialogue of legislators and the transatlantic Assembly , that this process is of paramount importance .
Someone spoke about helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I was very pleased to see you here and the statements made .
That is what I would like to emphasise in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today the European Parliament is sending a strong message to women who are helping their spouses in self-employed work .
Anyone who was in Gaza as a result of the conflict can bear witness to the enormous suffering of the population .
( ES ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is , from a strategic point of view , the most important relationship of the European Union .
I must say that our ambition is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , cash participation at Copenhagen awakens me hope that such an allies will ultimately have sleeping doors .
Mr President , I would like to support the proposal not to draw up a resolution because I have heard Mr Schulz say something that I think is very important : if we really want this debate to include &apos; Europe &apos; and not only Italy , it makes no sense to vote on a resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of Information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament proposes approving the regulation presented by the Council without further delay , because the new regulation would simplify the management of procedures and would guarantee the equality of treatment of legal third-country nationals in the area of social security .
This is a shocking figure , which I also mentioned in a report from the previous term of this Parliament .
But perhaps an EU Arctic policy is not as bizarre as Baroness Ashton nomination , this former Palin elevates of the Left , who is extremely unskilful as High Representative .
Such an achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October , which is simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union and which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that what we need is a reduction and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I believe that we have paid too little importance to developing completely new types of cars , which operate hydrogen cars , batteries and combustion parts .
Then everyone will go down their own path .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand , the European Union stands ready to support the state as long as possible during this complex process .
Indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which must allow job creation and wealth creation , is a real benefit for the local population and does not affect the European processing and conservation industry , it was vital to ensure that it was evaluated as soon as possible and allow for its suspension in case of need .
This is what the Commission and the Council are currently doing , in a commendable manner , to ensure that the gas supplies resume as soon as possible ; of course , the threats to legal action are not a very effective action plan .
It is indispensable that Member States immediately investigate extreme human rights abuses against Roma women , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and given redress .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a very complex issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies , but - and this has not been discussed - and to the importance of cooperation with the national parliaments and , in particular , with the committees for European affairs , budgets and budgetary control .
My suggestion to you would be that , now that the European External Action Service is implementing its regulations on access to information and documents , you are making it a modern organisation that is accessible to the citizens and does not treat foreign policy as if it were merely the area of secret diplomats .
All countries are now changing their economic policies to get out of the unfavourable economic situation as quickly as possible and to achieve as little economic growth as possible .
Let me also speak to you about the Japanese people .
Mr Barroso replied to me that this is an internal matter .
That is why we are among those who believe that it should not be weakened , but rather preserved and strengthened .
It is no secret that our European identity sources derive directly from the Christian tradition .
It is a very positive prospect for large corporations , but it disorganises public transport and is responsible for the degradation of the network and the threat of safety .
On the other hand , discussing Turkey &apos;s future integration into the EU cannot be left alone .
This risk must be managed efficiently and , as we remember the tragic events in Japan as a matter of urgency .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure a higher level of protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or savage items used in medicine .
In short , I can conclude this report this evening , but work is by no means completed , either to me or to the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and I would like to point out that my group - from the outset - has been rather prudent in accepting SIS II because of the numerous data protection implications .
Adequate conditions must be created .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints compared with 3 406 in 2008 , which represents a 9 % decrease .
The European Court of Justice also clearly rejected forced retirement at retirement age when the October judgment .
In addition , EGNOS and GNSS have considerable exploitation potential in terms of safety , the environment and the smooth operation of road transport , since they can be used for the collection of road tolls .
The cohesion area , which accounts for about a third of the budget , remains the only budgetary area in which the estimated error rate exceeds 5 % .
I would , of course , also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report which received majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of the solution proposed for exiting the crisis and moving to a green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , is actually to extend access for big business to profitable sectors , not to protect the environment and meet the needs of the grassroots classes .
I therefore share your concern that such important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency can be distorted by national debates or particularities rather than by what unites us .
I agree with the conditional coverage of costs on the basis of prior authorisation in justified and precise cases , when cross-border healthcare includes at least one night of hospitalisation and when it is necessary to use highly specialised and costly medical equipment , or when there is a particular risk to the patient or the rest of the population .
The main way in which we could have led would have been , and is still , to target a stricter target for reducing emissions by at least 30 % .
The abuses are harmful , especially for those players who are making real efforts to combat environmental damage .
The visa scandals of the past show , of course , how relaxed the visa waiver procedure is for some states .
The poor population in rural areas , which are in greater need of funding , is once again allowed to live by their own means .
I know that you have the ability to bring these challenges to a conclusion .
Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orbán has not presented himself to the groups in the European Parliament as a European politician of consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; which uses a populist and nationalist tone and &apos; defence of the Hungarian people &apos; of attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I look favourably at the report and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to create the nuclear bomb .
I am totally against the idea of a preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for stability in Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is a very important piece of work that enables us to jaloneer a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
With this in mind , we are committed to establishing the conditions under which the fisheries sector will become truly sustainable and be able to develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic are harsh , but there is also no doubt that , in the light of new technologies and developments , the area will inevitably be open for the wider exploitation of its natural resources , with fishing being a first example .
Due to the economic crisis , the youth unemployment rate has reached 20 % at the beginning of the year , and the school drop-out rate of 17 % , which mainly affects young people in rural areas .
At present , very many ecolabels , images and texts are being placed on the market that can confuse consumers , from images of conserve forests containing hazardous substances to non-CO2 food declarations and even environmentally friendly vehicles .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it was intended for European countries to take responsibility for the non-developed countries of the Third World , not to hold those countries accountable .
rapporteur . - Madam President , please excuse me for taking up everyone &apos;s time and late lunches , but I do so once every 10 years so that you will have nothing against it .
This is a sensitive task , a task requiring improved matters , and it simply does not have enough experience .
Last year , we decided to abolish these rules and , although our consumers did not notice too much difference , our producers saw and continue to see .
I believe that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , going exclusively towards austerity and the reduction in citizens &apos; social rights .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) to be cut because it would mean that agriculture would be worth less in Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of such a proportional power station , which is taken into account in economic calculations , creates huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the negotiated compromise proposal .
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , distinguished Mr Valdis Zatlers , it is a great pleasure to welcome you today , on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the drama has been resolved .
When there is agreement with a third country that can take illegal immigration and there is readmission agreement - which is the objective - and therefore the European Union &apos;s agreements with that third country are strengthened - that is , the global approach and the philosophy of the European Parliament on immigration - are strengthened the borders of the Member States of the Union .
We regret that the report does not take full account of our suggestion , but we welcome the fact that it is coming to a conclusion that is very close to us .
Because promoting more competitive agriculture in open world trade is one of the tasks entrusted by President Barroso by the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I take advantage of the Commissioner &apos;s presence in Parliament to ask him how he cooperates with his colleague responsible for agriculture to complete the Doha Round negotiations .
The report proposes to simplify financial control and monitoring and strengthen the technical and scientific assessment by means of a peer review based on excellence .
The proposals made here today must be considered , analysed and understood from this point of view .
It is also necessary to highlight legislative and administrative obstacles ( legal subjectivity , funding rules and , at times , intellectual property ) that can deviate many actors in the field of research and SMEs from participation .
I would like to know , however , whether the Commission will re-examine Directive 2007 / 52 of the points it has just mentioned .
That is why I also voted in favour of the provisions outlining corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , with regard to the new point that we have developed together , namely the issue of transparency , progress has been fairly slow and , indeed , in view of the new rules on access to documents , the possibility for those who conduct infringement proceedings or who are asking for such procedures to be initiated to find out why they have been concluded or why they have been initiated according to any standard .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that this is not the first time in this Chamber which , unfortunately , is always half empty this hour , we have debated the appalling human rights situation in Burma .
It is therefore the task of society to make it possible for women and men to be able to choose freely between the two logical options , which have every reason to exist , if we look from a broader perspective than that of work .
It currently promotes the consumption of products with little nutritional value , leaving livestock farmers who are unable to sell their products in a country producing 50 % of their own demand .
The full implications of the present situation on our portfolio and the development of our work cannot yet be clearly perceived .
In the context of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is today just as important than ever - and perhaps even more important than ever .
Fossil fuels create a centralised , hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution .
In this respect , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU has come halfway through the mandate , so it is worth looking at its achievements to date .
I believe that in reviewing the first railway package , the problems that the Member States have to receive the reasoned opinions from the Commission must be identified , as well as how they are settled .
Israel realises that such a broad military response only serves to incite further suicide attacks on bombs and the launch of new rockets Kassam as soon as the opportunity arises again .
The Burmese authorities have chosen to ignore the protests against the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and the demands for his release , which have been made by a large number of countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , the Secretary-General of ASEAN , and several ASEAN Member States , of which ultimately belong , and Burma .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , has informed us that the guarantees for EIB activities provided for in the EU budget amounted to almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009 , which means a great deal for the EU itself , in my opinion Parliament is right to ask for an explanation of the risks associated with this obligation .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but on behalf of Timo Soini and on behalf of me , I want to provide more information on the project , the information that all citizens of the Baltic States need , before building works commence .
Without the active participation of the Czech Republic , this decision would not have existed .
I believe that it is essential to carry out an information campaign in this respect .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has not been able to ensure that identity acts held by the people of Kosovo have been verified .
Action must be taken and clear and precise rules must be introduced in this area , too .
They are in favour of the vision proposed by Mr Corbett , of a federal United States of Europe , or of a more Europe of free trade , which my party supports ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report she is presenting today .
It is not a question of not imposing punishment - not imposing the penalty would mean maintaining this situation for many years .
We rarely meet people with so many qualities .
I firmly believe that all the inhabitants of Slovenia will agree that such a stress test be carried out immediately in Krško .
It is not good enough that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit to take place this down .
We have seen that a great deal of work has been done to achieve the benchmarks , and we ask the Commissioner to support Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania in order to meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
Under these circumstances , let the Moldovan Government force people to finance European agencies and programmes as uncertain as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Programme ( SESAR ) , when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , is a noticorian cynicism .
It would be to kill two birds out of a blow since this infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and create jobs , while also weakening the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Khanty Mansiysk , it was agreed that our common objective was to reach a strategic agreement that would provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations in the near future and help develop our potential .
Today , it is obvious that we do not have sufficient solutions to the problems of the Mediterranean and , in particular , in Libya : we need to think in depth , recognise that we will probably need a stronger initiative to understand what happened and also take concerted action in the Mediterranean .
Substantial funding by Europe for this line has been conditional on support for the project by the local population and the existence of funding through Italian private investment .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , reports on the accession process in the Balkans were published .
We , therefore , also abstained from voting on the proposals tabled by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on matters related to TV1 in Portugal , although it is known that the Portuguese Communist Party criticises this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has suggested a national reporting regime so that transnational corporations , too , report at national level .
One key issue addressed in the report is the issue of prostitution and trafficking in women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly , Mr President .
We approved the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to the completion , even with the arrest and trial of Mr Mladić and Mr Hadžić , the Court &apos;s work will not be completed .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the compensation applications introduced against those farmers responsible who have lived under their lifeblood without knowing their dreams .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve the European Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to be able to find solutions , we will have to use the same approach in future .
But you know that our message concerns structural reforms ; structural reforms to increase Europe &apos;s growth potential and Europe &apos;s capacity to create jobs are absolutely essential .
Particularly during the current global financial crisis , this partnership can be of extreme importance and open up new opportunities for trade in trade , science and technology , enabling us to emerge from the crisis on stronger , more stable terms .
We can no longer tolerate the lack of action .
in writing . - The subsequent approval and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has meant increased responsibility for Parliament and the administrative burden that this entails .
At a time of unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that the number of unemployed in Europe or poor workers does not reach 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to reiterate the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed together with four other Members and which has been approved by half plus in the European Parliament , with the aim of engaging the Council and the Commission in genuinely effective legislation to combat corruption .
Mr President , Presidents of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports your programme for Parliament and how you want to lead Parliament over the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let him fulfil his promises !
We believe that it is precisely through this kind of dialogue that we will manage to help these countries , particularly by increasing the participation of civil society .
As a socialist , I believe that the practice of guerrilla fighting under existing circumstances in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution , but the Tamil population has the right to defend itself against military repression .
It is time to support simple , less costly measures for SMEs , which will naturally lead to more jobs and more growth .
In combating this phenomenon , it is very important to accept unified security measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
When we talk about collective action , the subject of the United States and the experiences and excesses is always on the table .
The immediate entry into force of the agreements concluded between the EU and the US on extradition and legal assistance will support cooperation in the area of criminal law and help eliminate the grey area that has made flights possible in relation to extraordinary renditions cases .
I have three proposals and I want to ask , as emphatically as possible , for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has been asked several times to decide , in specific cases , whether sports activity is a service with purely social benefits , or whether , on the contrary , it also contains economic aspects , involving the fact that such an activity is a service of general economic interest .
I believe that protecting EU citizens is one of the main priorities of this institution , and they must be aware of that .
Only in time will we realise whether this proves to be a marginal problem or whether it will prevail the unquestionable positive effects of the directive .
By modernising the transport of goods logistics and promoting co-modality , that is to say combining different modes of transport within the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region .
Every Member State should have the freedom to decide in a democratic process whether or not they wish to ratify the ILO Convention .
in writing . - According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income varies between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1758 in Luxembourg .
The text that will be adopted in the future will probably not be so weak .
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment in many respects .
We are asking international donors , both government and non-governmental , to stop their activities in certain areas if the bill is adopted .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights , and this should be debated again .
( DE ) Thank you , Mr President .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe is a homeland of our homelands .
Therefore , if I address a Slovak policeman in Slovakia , he is obliged to respond to me in Slovak , even if Hungary is his mother tongue and even if I cannot understand his response .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to look again at one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the area of Swift &apos;s policies and justice , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of bank details from the Swift system to the US .
In 2009 , we observed an alarming increase in the number of forms of national protection used , both in European Union Member States and in new developing economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency has not been taken seriously by either the Commission or the Council .
Finally , politically , it is very important for us to have an alliance with the ACP countries within the framework of World Trade Organisation regulations .
We need to do something else .
If we are able to help bring together an abandoned orphan child and a family who wants a children , we will have made a very important contribution .
As it is an important step towards the success of the 2020 strategy , I would therefore like to talk in particular about how essential it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing with each other , and for us to cooperate honestly on the instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and on the European Union &apos;s humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza should also force us to adopt a more strategic and long-term approach to it .
It is necessary to develop other indicators to explain which influence living standards in a country .

Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions seeking to implement Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is in principle a vote on the position of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent global context , and in a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union is being called upon to strengthen its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , pursue its interests and protect its citizens , by developing a common vision of the main challenges and threats , and by aligning its resources and capabilities to provide an appropriate response to this , thereby helping maintain international peace and security globally .
This is a good moment for relations between the two parties and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This register will represent a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which , I hope , will contribute to greater legitimacy of the European project among citizens .
I suggest you read out the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore urge a proactive approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and on the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - and
But if we want to successfully address it , we must also support action through robust and decisive political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I have told you this .
I would therefore like provision to be made for these exceptions either clear deadlines or well-defined benchmarks , irrespective of how structured they may be , and perhaps the Commission should examine the proposals they intend to put forward to get closer to India &apos;s demands .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning we have heard all possible reproaches to the Italian Prime Minister , except that , thanks to his entrepreneurial activities , he provides jobs for tens of thousands of people .
Whether this is appropriate or not , it is a matter for Parliament itself to look at .
This report therefore serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme and calls for changes : to alter burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the low rate of success that make this programme still prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , at a time when they play an important role in transforming the results of research into products and services , to ensure better cooperation and coordination between the various parties of European stakeholders at a time when the research funding is still divided between the different parties and the research .
The fact is that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis ; it is subjective .
It does not get to a situation where our industries will be uncompetitive .
He asked for a total ban on the so-called &apos; body scanners &apos; that shattle &apos; to be banned .
Statistical data show that every year , cardiovascular conditions are the cause of about 4.3 million deaths in Europe and over 1.7 million people die of cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective public health measure for protecting Europeans from infectious diseases , but are also important for health services to reach developing countries so as to help raise life expectancy and combat poverty .
And , therefore , we must state firmly that the banks are exploiting the new rules that have been introduced into the euro area to increase their profits in the damage of citizens is an obvious nervous one .
Without a doubt , we must ensure in this economic situation , but also here in the European Parliament , that expenditure is kept under control .
I therefore believe that greater protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
It has played a very important role , because it has monitored all the processes carried out at the Supreme State Security Court and carried out regular assessments of detention conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
The day then , that every new Member State will respect the basic principles of the EU and ban discrimination , protect and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
It has not only affected financial credits , but also social credits .
These new measures would help European citizens and businesses to exercise their rights , especially as regards the recognition of their qualifications and social and residence rights .
The issue of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not unique .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment in order to prepare , if necessary , a European legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
This is a concrete point : men have the right to be fully involved in the first few days after their children are given birth .
These intentions deserve praise and not criticism , although this is not the main purpose .
The fact is that we in the EU must eliminate our absolute dependence on Russian energy supply .
Canada is currently , for the European Union , the 111th important trading partner , trade relations between the European Union and Canada representing approximately 1.6 % of total external trade in the European Union in 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this procedure in the Rules of Procedure was Marylène Renault , not me .
The country &apos;s own fisheries sector is still underdeveloped sufficiently .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate , we are discussing four reports and I would therefore like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the European Commission for their cooperation .
As far as the summit is concerned , I fully agree that this is an important opportunity .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which will be applicable - and that is why I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - in a uniform and non-bureaucratic manner across the EU , without harming the existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that China &apos;s representatives are well advised to study the documents in the archives of its government in exile to ensure that they themselves have not instigated violence .
It is its solution to the problem that has caused its development and integration in our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law so as to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day , we see many soapbox statements , which have no professional foundation , in the press and here in the European Parliament .
As human rights are an essential element of the agreement linking the Union to Pakistan , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in the country .
That is why I voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings , which is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it directly affects the buildings in which they live and use .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable , although temporary , position on derogations from the principles underpinning the European Union , including from the four fundamental freedoms .
But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this Parliament to consider that this is all a reason for a larger budget .
The time has finally come for this unilateral privilege that the United States enjoyed to come to an end .
Now that there is this directive , I would be pleased Mr Dalli , if you and the Commission were to focus more closely on the social security regulation , which is the system on which everything is based , which clarifies who is paid and where everything is well organised .
We must never lose sight of our common goal , and we must work with the Arctic states and with the international community to find the best and most effective way to preserve and protect the Arctic for future generations .
I think that was very necessary , and it is a good example of this House in terms of budget formation , using funds that were not used in other areas , so to speak .
Let us now take these hypotheses into account .
In order for this to happen , we must make every possible effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In areas as sensitive as clothing , the spotlight or the mobility , the conditions to facilitate consumers to make an informed decision are a major issue for companies that have decided to maintain production in Europe , keeping European knowledge and jobs .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument , promoting and strengthening relations with third countries , with certain tangible benefits .
Moreover , this is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to express its opinion .
With this proposal for a document , however , we have overcome this barrier , and this is because of the need to appease patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency .
I believe that every patient has the right to provide good quality care in his or her language , close to where he or she lives , with the family close to and seed .
When we speak in this Chamber , we must use the terms that everyone accepted , and FYROM , the candidate country , was accepted as &apos; FYROM &apos; and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be done and lead to better results .
The latest developments in the European economy , particularly with regard to Greece , have shown that there is an urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
Let us not forget that Stuart Wheeler , the sponsor of this party , said that the cost would actually be GBP 120 billion a year , 36 times higher than in reality .
This dual approach towards Belarus - by &apos; incentives and constraints &apos; , as called by Mr Tannock - is hopefully one that will succeed .
We could talk in hours about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation , whatever you like , but I think it is important that there is fundamental agreement between the three reports that have been presented today on what we have done recently .
Secondly , it also stated that the Commission should begin to examine the possibility of Eurobonds - finally , I could say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
This kind of credibility does not need Europe .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
According to this regulation , tyre providers must ensure , through labelling and self-collecting labelling , that users are informed about : fuel consumption and rolling resistance , wet grip addiction and outside rolling noise .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon .
In trying to achieve more ambitious and bolder results , I believe that , at the final stages of the COP16 negotiations , the European Union should give its chief negotiator some flexibility in order to be able to react to developments in these negotiations .
Therefore , balanced and transparent measures are essential because gaining the confidence of our entrepreneurs is an essential condition for the project &apos;s success .
There is the disastrous impact of extensive environmental urbanisation , especially in coastal regions or the Spanish islands , but also in other areas , such as around Madride , for example .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia follows the situation and work very closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and vice-chair of the European Commission .
These processes should include the necessary maintenance and supervision following the necessary closure , processing , storage and decontamination of waste , environmental rehabilitation of facilities and support for replacing the energy capacity of disadvantaged plants , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is my opinion .
I come from a country where , whenever I go to the supermarket , I see a man running a motto who has a book of timber in the back door .
For example , there was a whole discussion about selling off fertile land in developing countries and countries that do not have arable ground ; purchasing these land in themselves is a very interesting topic , and I think it is also a topic on which we will be able to reach a common understanding .
However , without a European network , the key objectives of the European Union will not be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco is grown in 17 of the 27 Member States and governments are subsidising each case .
One of the three - English , French or German - will be used to guarantee legal protection in the European Union automatically .
This is a very controversial issue in Ireland , which gives water to those who recommend a &apos; no &apos; vote on the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Presidency has done its best to reach an understanding , but ultimately it has decided that the European Council should decide that this issue should be decided by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that sometimes we do have different opinions .
That is how the Commission will work .
However , this may have been a unique case due to long-term relocation in the office building of the Agency .
The proposed amendments will allow less developed Member States , including Romania , to be eligible for this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear how so many Members across Parliament rightly boast the Belgian Presidency .
I do not need to emphasise the importance of both sides in the current circumstances .
Together we will cooperate to conclude the Doha Round with a positive outcome in 2010 , because this is extremely important in the efforts made to promote recovery and combat protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , this is a special day for me because , after ten years of loyalty , this was the last session I chaired here in Brussels .
For efficiency reasons , it also seems interesting to me that they should take some consular powers such as Schengen visas into the future .
It seems that we have spent too much time talking to us , rather than talking to others on a daily basis , and we have come to be downright disregarded .
In my opinion , the Commission proposal needs to be better drafted and Parliament therefore needs more time to make a decision .
Perhaps there are other plans to go further than what is currently being debated .
All Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation without the European Union and its protective shield .
As a democratic social democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made considerable progress in universal primary education , poverty reduction and increased access to drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso , before the Treaty of Lisbon , said that the institution that is speaking on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues was the Commission .
You can express opinions , there may also be disagreements , even the Eurosceptics are welcome , but the final result must be the same .
Lukashenko , who is an intelligent political player , was able to exploit his campaign programme , enjoyed political and economic benefits and , at the same time , continued to treat democracy and human rights with contempt .
Instead , according to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia were hoping to negotiate and conclude agreements on the small border traffic between Russia and neighbouring European Union Member States that would be interested in this .
This is important for the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , even you mentioned the shortcomings that still exist in a number of Member States in implementing European legislation .
These people must be treated as free and respectful citizens .
Hamas and the other Palestinian armed groups must admit that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without the threat of bombs .
We must do everything we can to ensure that it is recycled properly not only to prevent environmental and health damage , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot fail to recall that Omar al-Bashir is still under international arrest warrant without the authorities in that country bearing this in mind .
This letter has also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to submit to Parliament a detailed report on the first year running the project , with preparatory work on this issue already in place .
Mr President , I would have expected you to respond to that remark with a call to order .
With regard to the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is in principle correct , insofar as it refers to the prohibition and gradual replacement of products that have serious harmful effects on human health .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to define fishing opportunities for European Union vessels based on overfishing resources available , as well as due separately to financial contribution for access law and sectoral support .
We in the EU must give our full support to the new Tunisian Government of unity and also to the citizens of the European Union , including British citizens on holiday in Tunisia , who are therefore victims of riots .
Fellow Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and proper that the island of Taiwan is transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional media do not often meet expectations because of commercial interests , or because their leadership belongs to a specific political environment , which indirectly forces employees to practise coaches .
We cannot coexist in the European Union while this situation continues and therefore we believe that it is very important that the authorities of the European Union , the Commission and all of us put forward proposals in the same spirit to put an end to this situation .
This is something , and I will , furthermore , supervise a series of social , environmental and economic criteria , since I am committed to all legislation being assessed in advance .
These are the reasons why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Fund report .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are discussing Belarus here in the European Parliament , but talking is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support the motion and speak in favour of it .
Then I am delighted that East Jerusalem is seen as the capital of the future Palestinian State or Jerusalem of the two states .
The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be armed .
However , there are major differences between the regions of the same Member State .
Combating and eradicating violence against women is an essential strategic objective , important for the progress that our civilisation tends to make .

As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to put a question to the President of the Commission , who was very busy filled with the situation in the Mediterranean , illustrated by the images that we have seen in recent weeks , in which a lot of people have arrived in Europe fleeing the situation in Africa , while others have not succeeded .
However , this is not the case , with Lampedusa being a sad example of this .

In this respect , we , as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , have tabled an amendment that asks - not only with reference to Europe , of course , we are also addressing the United States , as the Commissioner knows - for all forms of export subsidies to be completely eliminated in the short term .
Most participants stress the need to make the CAP or focus on the competitiveness of European agriculture , the response to climate change , food safety and quality requirements , as well as other environmental objectives .
We also believe that negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded ahead of the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on

I have been in contact every hour with the people of Tunisia and the people of Egypt , our delegations , to whom I pay tribute for the things they have had to face in recent weeks and also in direct contact with the government and services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument takes on even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis , because it can help businesses to recover more effectively and perhaps in the future constitutes a pilot project for creating a more generous energy fund .
Those inspections were inadequate .
Then we will be able to make a great contribution from Europe , but this cannot be a joke .
I voted in favour of the special report submitted by the European Parliament &apos;s Ombudsman following the draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , on the excessive delay of the Commission in providing an answer to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
The main progress achieved in this directive when compared with existing legislation , it is that patients will be able to choose the healthcare provider and have access to the information about the quality and safety of the care they will receive .
I would reiterate the need for the European Commission to request mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in a flexible manner , as well as the review of the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund , in order to adapt them to the requirements of such tragedies .
Having consulted consumer protection organisations and representatives of the world of business , I understand that we need to push even further for greater harmonisation of consumer rights in the EU .
I said that anyone who questions is the bad figure in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the obligation to monitor the negotiations , in this case being trade negotiations , and to intervene politically by using the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , in order to be informed about the progress of these negotiations .
There is no recognition of investment by citizens in cohesion or social solidarity between generations .
The real reform , however , is about admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights problems in today &apos;s European Union .
Adequate financial resources must be made available to this end , which will allow opportunities to be utilised and the EU to exploit new sources of global competitiveness .
In many countries of Europe , it is a fact that public authorities pay late when they are in a difficult situation , often causing companies to go bankrupt .
The G20 conference also debated the eradication of tax havens , one of its main objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
Of course , the dollar remains the setbacks of global transactions , providing still a secure investment , but the colossal debt accumulated by the United States by financing their lifestyle by the rest of the world will increasingly spot the seeds of doubt about the ability of the economic power to honour its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and measures at its disposal to fight and overcome those who want to destroy it .
One relevant argument is that Iceland , when it was a rich country , was not interested in joining the European Union .

However , it remains a problem which will move the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions throughout the Afghanistan military conflict .
We must fight against fragmentation and therefore urge Commissioner Andor to keep the regulations of the European Social Fund intact and not divide them up , as is sometimes suggested in this House .

on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Social Democrats cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to stress that negotiations are not indefined , which would be prepared for more realistic alternatives such as a preferential partnership .
This is why it is primarily a problem for these American states , which must be resolved by Washington .
Let me also add that we should implement a reform that makes European universities more independent and European , open to students and researchers , and create dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The buy-out quota can be retained in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage , if the Member States so wish .
I would like to make an appeal that 25 May , the date of its execution , be appointed International Day of the heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism , because many unknown people , who , like Pilecki , have lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedom , deserve to be remembered .
Let me briefly present what I have done .
If this were to become a majority in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the peace plan , which has guided so much funding , put it on track after the Balkan wars .
I hope that this will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I would like to play a nomination game and see EMAS in competition with the ISO , but because I believe that the system is good and we could help to meet the sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker answered a blue-card question by Cristian Dan Preda under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )

I know that , during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep meat sector advocated mandatory origin labelling .
Mr Kellz , I am extremely aware of the complexity of this issue .
Even though the majority of countries are facing a series of economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to halting the negative effects of climate change .
I would ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will trigger a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system .

For example , fraud rates in France and Spain are regarded as &apos; low suspect &apos; .

I also share the opinion expressed by many in this House that the greater European solidarity the better the relations between Europe and Russia will be .
Syria has a long way to go on with regard to freedom of expression and association .
There is still much to be done before we can guarantee women fair access to the labour market .
But , I repeat , the proposal needs to be reassessed for the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farming is drastic .
I supported the report because I wanted to highlight , in particular , a certain threat , which it mentions : the absence of reliable and comprehensive information for consumers on health properties , composition and origin of certain species of fish .
After all , history is full of examples of intervention by Western countries that have done more harm than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely incomprehensible and cannot address the issue of crime prevention for a number of reasons .

We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this and I very much appreciate the Presidency &apos;s support for our efforts to find a viable solution for the future .

I am voting in favour of the report on the establishment of a new microfinance facility , which will help those whose jobs are at risk of setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that we have made some progress in this direction by Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I fully agree with , and I believe that this report will allow us to define the legal framework of the urban dimension and introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes that are capable of assigning quality to the cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , I understand that the improvements that we have proposed on behalf of Parliament are essential to ensure the fairness and efficiency of the energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is vital that those who are self-employed are supported and encouraged .
In short , we do not need to ask for these funds from Brussels .
Mr President , it is clear to us and Europe , for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us in Europe , that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , a change element that is capable of triggering conflicts or bringing us together , and that is exactly what we are talking about today .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report because the food programme which is being envisaged is a key instrument for helping people with disabilities and which , in the context of the economic crisis , is suffering even in terms of meeting basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least one export credit agency ( ECAs ) receiving public support , which jointly represents the most important source of financing for projects in the private sector in the world .
We are therefore not voting in favour of the report .
By adopting such a position , we have helped to destroy this union government .

Opening of the sitting
I hope that the Commission will take a leading role in strategic coordination as regards developments in key areas such as promoting civic education , vocational orientation and employment from this summer .
Expenditure will be borne by the state of origin .
In particular , I take into account actions to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to launch a dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is very important for the stability of the area .
We can therefore expect a reactor accident to happen every 25 years .
In my opinion , this increased eligibility for housing for cofinancing expenditure from the ERDF must lead us to think about future developments , either in the medium and long term or in terms of the eligibility of funding or in terms of allocating funds to certain strategic priorities .
Today , the time has come , once again , to talk about violations of religious rights in these two countries - this time , against Christians .
Climate change : one of the biggest threats facing our planet .
Of course , human rights have benefited , as I was expecting , from special attention - the importance of ensuring that they are respected is clearly included in all the dynamic relations that we have and cover our work .
I must also say that the European Union has no jurisdiction whatsoever in terms of regulating airspace .
However , Europe is not a lever or a remedy for an economic crisis .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission on comitology and optional provisions .
I do not think that any of the soft words expressed here today , even by the Commission , can change the fact that the European Union is absent from Libya and that it is currently unable to put an end to the crisis in the cities or to the actions of Gaddafi &apos;s land troops .
For this reason , I firmly believe that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , EU citizens will benefit greatly from them , as they will be able to make a greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I share the hope that an agreement will be reached in the Council on the measures needed to ensure the markets and restore stability in the euro area , whether we are in them or not , because this is in everyone &apos;s interests .
Pre-accession funds have shown particular vulnerability in this respect .
This is a great opportunity for gratitude and joy .
We are therefore calling for an end to the war and violence by all parties , and we urge the EU to act accordingly .
The world outside Europe is facing the frontal energy challenge .
Energy efficiency index must be included in the sale or rental announcements published in the media .
It is necessary to encourage efforts to increase EU investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , stimulate the production of alternative , non-traditional energy sources , locally and improve infrastructure capacity intended to facilitate the link to new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which therefore results in an increase in internal demand and in economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider setting up a rapid response instrument within the ENP for a swift and flexible response to political changes in partner countries , as recently happened in the southern neighbourhood .
I believe that condemning the EULEX mission from someone here in Parliament supporting Serbia is simply a pity .
The problem is therefore that it is the only Members who listen to you who understand what you say in the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted what concerns our citizens , our electorate , namely our environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because , to work well , we must be in harmony with those who voted on us .
The EU budget cannot be used , as some of my fellow Members are advocating , as supplement to national budgets , at a time of austerity , but , on the contrary , it must reflect the difficult situation in which the EU Member States find themselves .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty did not give the Council any powers to address the issue of the Member States &apos; national constitutions .
It is not a state of normality .
You can do me cynically , but students do not always come to studies and tourists do not always visit for a limited period .
Is the global financial crisis , which has turned into the economic crisis , the cause of this situation or are we dealing here with its own mistakes , negligence and a lack of reaction ?
The second &apos; but &apos; concerns the role played by the Belgian Presidency in the post-Lisbon period .
The main objective of these regimes was and is to maintain the entire territory of this huge state , which is inhabited by a wide range of completely different peoples .
( PL ) Although many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
This applies to Japan in many areas , but I do recognise Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect its rice market , to protect its rice growers , to pay higher prices for its farmers than those on world markets , and to refuse massive imports that would endanger poor farmers , as our economies recognise , to protect certain sectors of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to talk about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen social priorities , as I have already told you when we discussed the broad political guidelines for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will move straight to the point by asking you what measures - and I use pluralism - the Commission intends to do in the short term to address these shortcomings .
That is exactly what was lacking at this point or not done sufficiently visibly for our citizens .
This does not concern citizens , and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 00.10 )
I hope that Parliament is sending a strong signal by endorsing with a very large majority the report by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank together with the shadow rapporteur Mr Susta .
Romania has also supported the policy of open doors , directed mainly at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that everything must be done to avoid the consequences of disasters and to restore living conditions .
I am equally and clearly referring to work-related accidents , quite frequent , but also to the hazardous substances used in the process .
In September 2009 , the Council began a detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund .
At this point , it is important to take account , in particular , of the island and the outermost regions which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , are currently faced with an infrastructure , private , commercial and agricultural property which are devastated , in many cases unable to urgently resume their musicial activities , especially in regions exclusively dependent on tourism , as the media description of events can stop potential tourists .
We have not seen such a long overturbulence of the industry , with enormous financial losses since 11 September 2001 and , despite the financial difficulties faced by all Member States , I would urge them to draw up plans to support an industry that simply cannot endure further losses .
At the same time , we must recognise that our exposure to risk also increases .
Madam President , I voted in favour of the resolution because the situation in Congo is a terrible one .
Mr President , I would like to make a small language and perhaps semanic comment .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
We can want something , we can want something with everything before it , but we have to see the reality .
Consumer protection organisations are in favour of binding measures for a collective redress scheme in all Member States , combined with other options , such as extending existing mechanisms of alternative conflict resolution mechanisms to collective claims .
It is a problem , as some people have said .
I would like to ask the Commission what it does to ensure that they are sacrificed in their home country , without having to carry out long and exhausting travel to consumer countries .
That is what we need to do .
And I ask myself , really , ladies and gentlemen , where human rights defenders have disappeared , who , like us , are also congratulating themselves that the West is secular and pluralistic , and who shamefully bow their eyes to a Middle East that is reserved for a single religion .
Action is being taken on this and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , bankers who waste our money are contemptible , but politicians , Mr Schulz , who are leaving deficits and debts on the shoulders of the younger generations are equally irresponsible .
For this , I must thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from every group .
We believe that now everything is in the hands of the Member States .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights was good ; relations have been very cooperative in reality .
We must strive to ensure that the programmes provided provide the greatest possible support for the reforms undertaken in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that every Member State maintains national contact points to provide patients with the necessary information , for example , on the availability of healthcare , procedures and documentation .
Some time ago , we felt all that was happening in Russia as ideological pressure , but now we are trade in absolute individual freedom .
Regardless of whether it is a public or private fund , the report refers to a very specific issue , which aims to establish by Parliament that there is no legal basis for its deficits to be subsidised , first and foremost , that such deficits will not be granted .
Their figures must , of course , be the most expensive figures from Elenna in Troia , which launched a thousand ships .
Aid leading to distortions of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences both for jobs and for technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a few things that we must bear in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard the various Members say that we want to see a more robust Stability and Growth Pact with a different voting mechanism .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) All of this being said , I think it is very important that we return to the substantive issue .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) ) )
In order to show solidarity with the campaign to halt this barbarbaric ritual , I encourage you all to wear an oil today to expressly express your opposition to this practice .
Democratic control is sidelined , given that national governments hide behind the Commission and the trio of presidencies on the most basic measures , while the Commission leaves these matters in the hands of national governments .
Investing in the future : New Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
As a result of the threats from the Commission with the start of legal action in the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now begun to allow decent use of the BDE .
It is obvious to those of us who are in rural constituencies , and to those in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the current position of many livestock farmers is simply unviable .
Those making savings must benefit from transparent , easy to understand and available information .
I think we could support the Chinese people in achieving a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms during the vote because I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus protect our future .
It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - a social organisation or non-governmental organisation - should clearly specify the subject and the objective of the initiative , although it does not necessarily have to table a proposal for a legislative act .
There is a city in Latvia , DAavpils , where more than 90 % of the population are rubbish .
In this respect , I would like to welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apologies , as well as the recent motion by the government of the Czech Republic , which asks that , by 31 December 2009 , the Ministry of Health will take a series of measures to ensure that these violations no longer occur .
I welcomed the report , because GDP is an indicator of market economic activity , which has become a standard benchmark for political responsibility worldwide .
Currently , the effects of globalisation have been completely overwhelmed by the financial and economic crisis , and our purchasing reactions are adjustments to the EGF &apos;s financing criterion .
in writing . - ( PT ) This resolution reminds Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence on 17 February 2008 , which was recognised by 69 countries , and encourages the Member States to work together in their joint approach to Kosovo in the light of Kosovo &apos;s planned accession to the EU .
Compared to any other institution , Parliament can still be considered as a leader in terms of transparency and I would therefore not make it my number one priority , early when , as regards the accessibility of documents and the transparency of its meetings and the activities of its members , we are more open than any other national parliament .
It was the Italian Minister for Reform , Umberto Bossi , who prepared domestic policies .
The warning signals from the Danish Human Rights Observatory - my region - and many other organisations deserve to be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of the report by Mr Casini .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution on the prohibition of pork and thrombin .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and will monitor the ongoing investigation closely .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data are also not entirely suitable for setting out the measures to be used to discipline Member States with the highest rates of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most efficient way to reduce the consumption of energy and emissions by 20 % in sectors that do not apply to the EU SEC system .
Honourable Members , on the second question , I can assure you that the Commission is aware that MRAs &apos; control requires a multidisciplinary approach .
Yesterday &apos;s trialogue offers hope for a final agreement .
Future projects , based on an annual increase of around 27 % in the coming period , show that they will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted , so that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what ACTA is and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because this financial assistance from the EU will help those who have become victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and thus not be affected by the recession .
Since the Internet is the main tool for creating better conditions for the development and knowledge of citizens , culturally , especially through the dissemination of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in the field of radio spectrum and in the creation of information programmes for development and innovation .
And all this comes on top of the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and the problems that would be caused by the reception of a country that has common borders of more than 80 million inhabitants : factors that will continue to strengthen my unclear belief that it is not good for Turkey to join Europe , whose unity depends , above all , on Christian spirit .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests in the Chamber )
This means going against the environment and consumer safety , because old equipment , with a high energy and potentially hazardous consumption , will be put back on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I wanted to formally thank the mayor of Balingen , Dr Reitemann , and the local council for enabling the funeral monument to be lifted for these young people .
Thirdly , I would like to ask Mrs Kroes very much to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we want to be proud of this extraordinary pilot project in the future .
Anyone who has known and has seen the results of the environmental disaster caused by the Technological accident in Baia Mare and the subsequent discharge of toxic cyanide waste in water courses , with the profound effects on the Tisa river in Hungary , as well as from the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything possible to ensure that something similar could never happen again in the European Union .
That is the responsibility of each one : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries over EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , it is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and their property : fundamental freedom of movement , as you said , to cross dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the rejection of the Commission proposal .
The most important thing is that we had the courage to convene this summit , that we invited it with the social partners , that we would prepare it together with them in the long term - ahead of the summit on employment , three rotats will be held in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we will try to reach valuable conclusions for the June Council meeting .
In other words , the European Parliament established at first reading a solid foundation for the correct application of the rules for cross-border healthcare in the Member States so that patients could , in justified cases , comply with the rules stipulated and without encroaching the courts , receive the necessary care in hospital and non-hospital provision in another Member State .
This has also been proposed by the Barnier report , but so far , we have not reached a conclusion .
There is no more time to lose .
With another gross exercise in distortion of reality , we are once again facing a shameful attempt by the European Parliament to intervene in Venezuela .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a discussion document containing new data , as well as different types of users &apos; opinions on this issue , and we will address the outcome of this public consultation .
Thank you for your participation .
I would add that , if a person is kept in detention , this is provided by the European Convention on Human Rights .
