That makes no sense.

Today, when it comes to production and employment, there are only a few niche layers left in the sectors of the average/high level, luxury and high technology.
This undermines confidence when a government submits its banks to a summer's stress test and only a few months later realised that it was, in fact, a stress test for the euro and not for the banks.
I very much welcome the adoption of this report, as it expresses the joint feelings about one of the engines of the current and future development of the European Union, namely the promotion of research and innovation, expresses joint feelings of their main stakeholders: the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of projects, while at the same time strengthening the scientific and technological assessment process.

Unfortunately, we then realise that behind many measures there is a deliberate intention to conceal the irresponsibility that still exists within our institutions, including a legislative body with bail-outs.
To this end, I would like to add to the political aspects that are significant because, as has been said, it is a society that practices multipartism, even limited, with a quota for opposition, probably, but it is still multi-partism.
The appointment of the 18 additional MEPs was problematic, because some Member States had not really provided for a procedure, but we decided that representativeness was what was meant to guide our decisions and that this House had to have a balanced representation as soon as possible.
As has already been said, a balanced occupation of the territory, an economic and social development that is in harmony with the nature and the strengthening of cohesion within the EU are also fundamental to disaster prevention.
I hope that we will be able to improve our trade relations with Japan and I look forward to further progress in this regard.
The legal texts before us define the framework and set out the main guidelines, but the real and concrete measures to be taken are not yet set out.

Information and communications technologies (ICT) represent an important sector, in particular, because of the weight they represent in the European economy, are 7% of Europe's working population and 6% of GDP, and therefore a significant share of the European economy and also European productive and working forces.
I think we can expect a mass of initiatives from the Commission to do more, to demand that there be more Europe, and there is no doubt that the Commission will respond enthusiastically to this request.
For, if we do not take our responsibilities and if we do not take a clear position, we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier: we need to be aware that in 2020 - and we have defined this in the Digital Strategy - every European should be able to continue with its interests, ultimately by means of opportunities for spectrum.
These organisations are basing their power by responding to the daily needs of the people and then consolidating it by terror.

This protocol provides for a Union contribution in favour of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe for an amount of EUR 682 500 per year, of which EUR 227 500 will serve to support S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe's fisheries policy, which I believe is appropriate.
We will see how it will be implemented in future.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament's efforts more seriously in this regard, although I am very concerned about the departure of the representative of the Council from whom I am very concerned.
If we Europeans are called upon to play an active role in this regard, it is essential that we continue to do so.

I would also like to stress that we can provide assistance to third countries, as the previous speaker said.
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential, even if it concerns only one hundred per cent of national health budgets because, beyond the figures, it is the entire force of the symbol that is to be stressed, namely the legitimate right for every European citizen to receive treatment abroad and to be reimbursed for the care received in good information.
Nevertheless, as a primary measure of prevention, I would like to see measures to encourage healthy lifestyle, a key factor in improving health.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by what some of my fellow Members have said, which, on the one hand, advocate simplification for small and medium-sized enterprises, but on the other hand, when it comes to taking the first step towards micro-entities - it is indeed true that we are talking about today, not companies of any other size - are again being tempted to say'no'.
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage this waste to reduce its harmfulness and the adoption of more demanding regulators who prevent the violation of this directive.

We ask him to stop ridiculating Parliament and to lend himself to engineering.
Therefore, together with my group, I support this directive, which represents an important step by Parliament; a step that will have a beneficial effect on the lives of European citizens.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on consumer rights presented by the Commission has the merit of bringing together the four previous directives on the subject into a single legislative instrument.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, particularly Mr Presedo, on behalf of the socialists, and Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Liberals, who have done a fruitful job with me on the compromise text presented today as a report on the Commission's White Paper.
(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, we can estimate the extent to which this debate is of interest to authors of the question by the fact that none of them is present in this House, so they will have not heard what Inese Vaidere has just said - that Russian visa policy is a weapon used not to promote the naturalisation process in Latvia, but to do exactly the opposite.
However, I think that the work we have done makes it possible for us to be optimistic.
I believe that the European Union should evaluate this option correctly in the forthcoming dialogue negotiated by the High Representative.
(DE) Mr President, the debate reflects the unresolved problems of economic policy in Europe.
In addition, the Commission's control strategy for research is designed to provide reasonable assurance of the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis extending over the entire framework programme.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year thousands of children are the victims of child traffickers and an even higher number are trafficked.
Good governance and regional policy of the European Union (
It should not be forgotten that GDP is an instrument for measuring production and not environmental sustainability, for example.
Such cooperation greatly facilitates the task of a rapporteur.
Therefore, from a political perspective, it is absolutely important to vote in favour of this text, and this section of Mrs Wallis - and indeed part of the House - is absolutely not justified, given the debates we have had.
Furthermore, this position is backed up by both the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss Institute of comparative Law and the report by Mrs Schaldemose adopted in 2009 by Parliament.

Measures are needed to reduce late payments in commercial transactions in order to protect the good health of the European economy, thereby avoiding the financial asphyxy of production structures and the additional costs of financial products which increase dependency on the banking sector.
It is absurd to encourage the import of products that do not even meet the quality criteria imposed on our farmers.
To conclude, there are huge challenges ahead of us to ensure unity at European level, to engage in strategic links with key external partners and to maintain our total commitment to multilateral climate action, but COP 15 can also allow us to learn a lot from this.
This cooperation must therefore be based on real problems; it must ask the right questions and focus on specific measures that will provide added value to people's everyday lives.
Oral questions and written declarations (submission): see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude.
I welcome Parliament's amendment along the lines of protecting bees, which play a key role for farmers and providing food through pollination.
In this way, we can encourage users to choose, in the long term, for vehicles or cleaner modes of transport, to use less convenient infrastructures, or to move at different times.
In the area of security, we are destabilised by Iran's attitude and the worsening situation in Afghanistan.
I think it is important to deal with the negotiations by bearing in mind that the best solution to the issue is a solution that involves everyone having a shared commitment.
We need to distinguish between Member States with high standards and those on lower levels.
On the other hand, other states have decided, for reasons that seem to reflect their own narrowed interests with regard to candidate countries, to exploit the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of this area, and to try to prevent them from entering.
I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on this text to allow the freezing of air slots for the summer season.
Therefore, we need to analyse, for example, what has happened in Detroit in an attempt to avoid mistakes, but we must refrain from reacting with reflex after every attack, which would probably result in us trying to adopt meaningless measures in some cases.
At least, the work of full-time mothers should be reviewed in the calculation of retirement pension.
Any further malicious and unfounded attack would be unnecessary.
In this regard, Europe's approach could be a'yes', of course, we need external supply security, we need security of supply and of innovative projects such as Desertec, but we also need to ensure that the population, companies and individual households can have better control of their energy budgets and their energy consumption in terms of price, economy and the environment'.
For all these reasons, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the proposals calling for an impact assessment and we will vote in favour of the amendments by Mr Sturdy - whom I myself signed - relating to endocrine disruption, as well as those aimed at facilitating the availability of plant protection products in the event of an emergency.
It is absurd that the same countries that work tirelessly must pay indefinitely for the mistakes of others.
Europe has been heavily involved in the region for some time, by investing EUR 1 billion a year in Afghanistan, EUR 300 million a year in Pakistan, forming the EUPOL mission to carry out invaluable work despite staffing problems, convening the international observation mission, and, of course, by the commitment of the States to the ISAF mission.
That is one thing.
It is also necessary for India to develop and implement transparent and clear public procurement regulations, which will also allow European companies to take part in it.
Thus, with a sensible impact assessment, and by retaining the different legal options and precisely setting out the objectives and funding of the European infrastructure, it will be easier to carry out long-term strategic projects aimed at building a stronger European Union.
The ratification of the new START Treaty, which is still pending in the United States, is part of this process.
It is increasingly mobile and an analysis of recent threats suggests that organised crime is increasingly involved in criminal activity in cyberspace.

I believe that your contribution is all the more fundamental because the current context obliges the Member States to make difficult choices where I believe it is essential to preserve research and innovation as investment for the future, and I can assure you that I will inform the Council of the content of this debate and I am committed to your willingness.
We should have the humility to recognise the right to democracy and the parliamentary supremating in the 27 Member States.

In addition, Member States are obliged to ensure that no repatriation is carried out in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires Member States to ensure that a person is not reconducted in their country if they are likely to suffer persecution or serious violations of their return.
This attitude should give your action a vigour that it would not have if you were optimal for an spending clause and allow the various funds to function separately.
It is fundamental that, in drafting European legislation, consideration should be given to the extreme vulnerability of women and children who are exposed to domestic violence.

Mrs Ronzulli, please sit down and you are silent.

That debate is closed.
This and other matters could have been discussed at the summit.
Georgia's territorial integrity cannot be called into question.
You will see that these figures are almost equivalent.
That is why a debate is needed, as you will remember, this year in 2009, the Commission committed to presenting Parliament with a communication that assesses threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information at European level and stresses the importance of a directive ensuring pluralism of information in the context of new technologies and, in particular, television.
The effective implementation of this directive and the correction of the deficiencies identified during the transposition and application of the previous directives would allow European Union citizens to be given more comprehensive protection against discrimination.

It is also essential to prioritise food security, agriculture, infrastructure, capacity development and, in particular, economic growth, access to technologies and human and social development in the LDCs.
So let us stop!
In the long term, the aim is better application of European legislation, thus improving animal health and ensuring decent living conditions for the animals concerned.
What initiatives will you take to encourage rich countries to contribute to the cost of the crisis?
We also need good practice and Slovenia, for example, is following the vehicles circulating on its national road network.
It is also important for these solutions not only to benefit our citizens today and tomorrow but also to ensure the future of our children.
If we want to avoid closure, we need to keep the operating rate up to 30%.
There are issues to be dealt with urgently.

To summarise, I would stress that all the non-conventional measures we have adopted during the period of intense financial pressure are temporary in nature and have been designed by means of exit strategies.
This report is appalling by what can be seen from the behaviour of this Parliament.
rigour in the organisation of projects, efficient use of resources and clarity regarding the duration of these projects
At the moment, this is impossible and, therefore, they are at risk, as you said.
On the other hand, I would like to say that I support all Turkey's democratisation efforts.
In this proposal for a directive, the Commission broadens the concept of micro-enterprises, so a micro-enterprise is a company which, on the verge of drawing up balance sheet, meets two criteria: a balance sheet that does not exceed EUR 500 000 in total, a net turnover of EUR 1 000 and/or as many as a maximum number of 10 employees employed on average.
However, take our commitment to climate change: everyone knows that we have leadership in the world.
rapporteur. - Madam President, you will take me a little unprepared because I did not see the total change in the programme today, but I am very grateful for being able to address the House on a very important issue of the financial services sector, namely the insurance and resurance sector, of what we have done with the Solvency II report and how we will ultimately be able to establish this European Parliament, in order to establish a very concrete measure of regulation.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to go up to 30% and I will end up by quoting Barack Obama:'We can give up jobs from the future to our competitors or we can, as they have already started, take advantage of the opportunity of the century.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make four points.
That is why a few Member States and I have also invited an expert who investigated organ trafficking and the murder of people in China to use their organs for transplantation and will be addressing us tomorrow.
President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for a constructive and comprehensive report, and I wish you a successful presidency.
These initiatives, supported by EU funds, will bring us closer to working in a concrete way on specific projects and programmes by combining forces from each institution and thus offering an excellent boost to the development of our common work.
(SK) Once again, we have a problem with respect for the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia, due to the Minister for Education, a right-wing nationalist party in power.
Cooperation between Europe and the United States is a real tribute to the negative effects of globalisation in view of the necessary protections such as the right of European citizens to administrative redress and receive the same treatment as US citizens and energy measures for the storage of information.
The EIB can and must play an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean.
Therefore, I support the call for an investigation into the division of margins applied within the production and distribution chain.
However, if you always place the'polluter pays' principle at the forefront - and I am ready to discuss it with you - it is the Member State that causes congestion by not providing sufficient infrastructure.
The first is credit for student mobility.
The important thing, however, is to be aware that, if these disasters are particularly intense at Europe's southern borders, we have here an opportunity to increase sympathy and attach citizens to what Europe means, namely, added value in terms of response.
Today, Europe is losing speed, although its percentage of population is higher than that of countries that are experiencing success such as China or India.
That is why we need more Europe and a better Europe: a more united and more ambitious Europe.
I am convinced that these agreements are a step in the right direction.
The Greek Communist Party opposes this report and voted against the amendments to adapt the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following remark: it is very strange that, although the growth indicators for Albania are steadily increasing, with a growth of over 2% in 2010, in full global economic instability, and have to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is worsening rather than improving.
Human trafficking also remains a serious problem within the European Union.
Then there are other problems that I would like to stress, as Mr Paparizov said.
In South Sudan, the EU must make a significant contribution to the stabilisation, development and the strengthening of institutional capacity.
As you said, the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution needs to be applied, which provides for decentralisation in terms of administration by those who live there and the European Union can provide valuable assistance in this area.
Let me reiterate that there are, of course, differences of opinion, and there are differences between the Commission and the Council, as well as among some Members of this House, concerning the regulation of ship-by-boat transport; there are those who would prefer separate legislation for inland transport and maritime transport.
I support the reasoning behind this proposal, namely, the need to define a coherent and comprehensive framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure in the Union, which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of play in the energy sector.
The beginning was reassuring: in 1995, a global consensus was reached that men and women were political, economic, legal and social in every respect.
The Serbian authorities must step up their efforts to ensure the development of democracy and the rule of law in the country, and they must continue their fight against corruption and ensure that those who abuse their position are severely punished.
In short, the Europe we are fighting for, namely, a Europe of justice and social progress, economic and social cohesion, cooperation between sovereign states and peace, has little chance of being created with the guidelines that this Commission is proposing to follow.
It is important for democracy and legitimacy to communicate with our citizens about what the European Union is doing.
We Germans would not recognise the merits of our national unity if we did not see it as the unity of Europe, following the historical events I have presented here.
To simplify, the same person assumes the mission of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
As I have already said in this House, I stand before you on the idea of a Europe of cooperative nations.
- Report: Elles
In the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained.
Furthermore, the obligatory nature of this register for all lobbyists who wish to be able to access constantly to Parliament and the Commission marks an important step towards greater transparency in relations between these organisations and the European institutions.
If we adopt everything at first reading, Parliament will strip itself of its rights.
This is a very important step which enables more effective application of the fundamental rights of European Union citizens.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Kirilov report will be voted in a few weeks' time, and I am pleased that it is a matter of urgency.
Personally, I was not entirely convinced of the usefulness of this legislation because most vans are bought by companies, small or big companies, which are already fully aware of the need for the economy and of energy efficiency.
I propose a study on the periphery.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general remark and then to ask two or three questions, following the time you will allow me.
We must also bear in mind that, by welcoming Turkey into the European Union, we will have at our door to countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria.
I think we ultimately have to understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without always bearing in mind the employment parameter.
What are we expecting from the Union?
We must not forget that we are responsible for all the actions that we take before our electorate, which are currently going through a difficult period.
However, for this very reason, they are also likely to generate enormous distortion of competition if their funding operations are not subject to common rules.
I believe that good governance of the single market can only be achieved if we have current and good information on how it works.
in writing. - (ET) Against the backdrop of the current global economic crisis (namely the economic recession and rising unemployment), there is a reality in the European labour market that wants to see more and more redundancies, which will further increase the total number of people affected by poverty and marginalism in Europe.
Of course, they already had a flagship and anthem, but they do the construction of a new state.
These elements are covered to a certain extent by corporate social responsibility, but they cannot be implemented without national frameworks.
This is indeed a compromise.
Adequate operational assistance should be provided in the event of an accident and of providing passengers with the services and articles they need most.
The Council accepts this common text, so it is now up to the President of the European Parliament to declare the budget as definitively adopted.
We must support the introduction of private funding mechanisms and the adoption of more frequent public and private initiatives with the aim of strengthening the Union resettlement programme.
However, our aim is also to put an end to misleading Internet advertisements that encourage some people to buy products that are not only helpful but can harm them.
Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment on this amendment, abolishing two parts of the amendment, that is to say,'by the Colombian army' and'Columbia'.
I also call on the Commission to take concrete steps and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe.
Madam President, I think this is one of these reports that many people can support.

Europe cannot simply be the sum of 27 national interests.
Meanwhile, Mr Reinfeldt presents the report on the activities of the last six months of the European Council.
We need to turn the negative impact of austerity measures, which will prevent workers from obtaining jobs in the public sector, into a positive effect for young businesses, and we need to take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit by reducing the costs of setting up companies to enable them to make the private sector we need to get out of our countries of the abyss in which they currently find themselves.
Both entities have not managed to find a common vision, which prevents progress from continuing.
In the final analysis, does this free trade agreement really only suit the world and the distribution of economic power between Europe and India that we know today, or will it always agree in 10 or 15 years?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and rapid Internet connections by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only due to the global crisis, but mainly to the lack of immediate action needed when the crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova.
European and poor workers in Europe must mobilise their forces against these disastrous policies, and in favour of a truly democratic and socialist Europe, and that means opposing the policy of this new European Commission.
The European Parliament stands for its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Animal welfare requirements are now officially part of the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when policy making in sectors such as the internal market.
First and foremost, it talks about regions and their cultural heritage, and it is a wealth that regional development policy will take into account and bring to the fore.
I think that is what we need to focus our efforts on.
You will need all your power of persuasion to give new impetus to international trade policies within the EU.
Indeed, this reserve is a'accounting' method that should be used to deal with any emergency situation that may occur during the current year.
Let us make a minute's silence in memory of our Tunisian friends.

We are conducting this debate too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Mill√°n Mon on his remarkable report, which is presented at a very good time for strengthening relations between the two continents.
This is why we have proposed a significant simplification of Community law.
I regret the rejection of important motions for amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, resulting in the fact that initiatives cannot be signed by people resident in the EU without being citizens of any of its Member States, so not all EU residents are equal independently of nationality over their participation in the citizens' initiative.
I call for the creation of an independent committee composed of local and international experts in order to carry out the necessary investigations and proceedings concerning the violent events that have plunged the elections held in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what is known as the West will also, to a large extent, depend on the results achieved in Afghanistan.
Things have gone too far and must be stopped.
The development of a guide for public and private actors and the establishment of a multi-level training and mobility programme could be effective measures for improving regional policy.
I hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join in this, but we cannot let things drag on any longer, because the whole world wants the innovation market.
Furthermore, I believe that we have a duty to determine the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), will respond appropriately to this.
Mr President, the ongoing negotiations on a new EU-Vietnam Cooperation and Partnership Agreement must also include a clause on respect for human rights and civil liberties.
Irrespective of the adoption of certain important measures proposed in the report, I would like to draw attention here to an essential element of the problem.
However, this method will not exposed the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations.
This will not have a detrimental effect on cod stocks because the by-catches of cod are very reduced at the moment.
The penalties proposed are proportionate and necessary, and it is to be hoped that they will discourage the wrong commercial practices adopted by certain commercial operators.
This criterion is, in my opinion, unfair and discriminatory because, as is the case in Portugal, most families live in shelters in rural areas.
This is a way of measuring poverty according to absolute and purely financial criteria, without taking into account the diversity of the 27 Member States; the argument, in short, is confined to a question of insolvency.
Therefore, both ODA resources and new funding will be required.
The ethical audit of the work of this project has resulted in a positive result, which has been certified.
In my opinion, the ratio of 75% cofinancing that is currently being proposed is too high.

The rapporteur particularly regrets the misknowledge of citizens about the rights she can grant them.
While the construction of the area of security, justice and freedom within the Union is an imperative requirement for all of us, and perhaps also a model of European democracy, to be built, and if many of us consider that Europol is a tool that can be adapted, we are all bound by the greatest possible legal guarantees - including human resources, but especially the technical means for combating organised crime, we are, with every kind of legal certainty - that we will be in Europe.
Therefore, it is crucial to adopt all measures which will consolidate guarantees relating to the transparency and independence of IAs, as such a measure will optimise the role of this instrument as the pillar of the legislative process and ensure the quality and relevance of the activities of the European institutions.
My second point is that the strategy should increase the internal cohesion of the EU, in other words, its convergence.
This was not the direction in which the Commission worked, since its proposal, through the regulation that you adopted, focused on the renovation of the current system of agencies, which are private agencies, and on the very stringent tightening of transparency requirements to avoid conflicts of interest, honesty, in their work as part of rating agencies.
In addition, the report calls on the Commission to carry out a cost-benefit and cost analysis of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Already before the crisis that we are experiencing today, the Member States of the European Union were facing social problems resulting from a lack of economic growth, with a complicated demographic situation and by difficulties linked to the growing globalisation of the economy.

It is important that this framework decision does not result in unjustified bureaucracy in cases where, given the nature of the problems in the presence, more appropriate options are already available.
The Bank did not see a major crisis coming and did not catch up either in its Rules of Procedure, which is far from over.
However, a serious organisation like the European Union should be better prepared for such events and should, in particular, be ready to react effectively to emergencies.
- Report: Kaczmarek
Therefore, we should not support its inclusion only in the event that these measures are not effective.
I am committed to informing the European institutions of this civil protest.

- Report: Maria do C√©u Patr√£o Neves
I would like to speak more specifically about two issues that were raised several times in this debate.
Firstly, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks to the European Parliament for its cooperation and for its spirit of compromise, which has enabled us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee, for the benefit of passengers in bus and coach transport, particularly with regard to people with disabilities and passengers with reduced mobility.
This is partly due to the fragmentation of our defence equipment market.
Energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy were already important aspects at the beginning of this period.

With its massive vote, the Irish people give us the courage and strength to continue to flourish and build a strong and, above all, federal Europe.
While protecting the environment and protecting the health of citizens go hand in hand, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
It is amazing that we must resolve together.
To resolve this problem, we must work together with the main consumer countries, such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan, and put in place a global system of alert and recording illegal farms, gathering Interpol and an ad hoc UN body, which would benefit from the latest satellite detection technologies.
Of course, we cannot leave short-term support for the industry to damage its long-term competitiveness.
I would like to say that this is a report based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Due to the effects of the current economic and social crisis, the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has, in particular, drawn the attention of European citizens and institutions.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to say that I feel that this subject is too important for us to continue to live in lies as we do in Europe.
We did not know the name of the candidates, as we said, we did not have a candidate even though, let us be honest, Commissioner Barnier, quite rightly told us.
We are delaying the abstention rates in the European elections and sanctions in referendums.
We will ask what is going to happen and we will come back to you, Mr Coelho.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements cover a very wide range of regulations and legislative vacuum, voluntary or no, which could lead to the elimination of competition.
We also need a more efficient common European asylum system and better protection.
That concludes Question Time.
I also noticed that all of you are here, willing to commit you to police cooperation which, of course, respects human rights, is attentive to the European Union's values.
Picasso pated this horror in his Guernica scoreboard, which was filled by the Junkers of the lorry Condor 10 years ago.
In this sense, speculators also tried to speculate on a bad economic situation and sometimes aggravate it.
Mr Bov√© is absolutely right and Mr Fajma profoundly...
We certainly need to promote competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution, thereby ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on the amendment to the Staff Regulations of Officials against the background of the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) is a major document on the path towards the creation of a Union foreign policy.

For us, Kosovo is an exceptional case and we would like to stress that Spain, like four other Member States, does not recognise this' state'.
These reasons are justifying not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit in response to the appeals of the Belarus opposition.
This is a very important approach for highlighting the humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I support what my fellow Members have said about the rights of travellers with disabilities and what Mrs Kadenbach said about children, about the issue of forest fire fighting facilities in hotels and, above all, about the state of land extinction systems in all EU hospitals, and the need to adapt the new proposal to future needs.
I also wanted to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission, so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment.
The report clearly states that Member States have the exclusive authority in the area of national defence and security, which we believe is important to emphasise.
Similarly, the Member States most concerned about asset stripping and disguised acquisitions were those with no lower disclosure of the contracts for difference.
I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen agreement contains references to the level of ambition needed for the post-2012 agreement to tackle climate change, lay the foundations for a financial package and to call for serious commitments to reduce emissions.
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis still claim four million victims each year.
From a more strictly commercial point of view, I would like to ask the Commissioner to reassure us that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to impede the sale of products available at more competitive prices; the sale of safe generic medicines that do not infringe intellectual property rights and whose only crime is that they are produced in emerging countries such as India and Brazil and the Western plant.
After all, Member States have the right to have a say.
This is unacceptable.
We want to take part in these actions.
That is why we need to find the right level of financial and technological compensation.
This is also an area where we can take stronger action under competition policy and consumer protection policy.
It is also disgraceful that these politicians are calling for us to accept the result of the second referendum when they have not, in fact, accepted the first result.

The Heads of State or Government have also pointed out that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union and that we will also ask our neighbours to carry out these stress tests.
The distinction between the mandates of the military and humanitarian actors must be clear and a dialogue between military and humanitarian actors is needed in order to promote mutual understanding.
The work is under way to the Commission for a more systematic assessment of the quality of public finances, including aspects of the establishment of the budget according to efficiency.
For me, this aspect will be a priority as Trade Commissioner.
The Commission could, as a result, submit amended or new proposals in this case.
The United States still has to introduce clear and transparent criteria for the refusal of visas in certain Member States.
The outstanding issue is funding.
For others in this House, there is a need for constructive criticism of Turkey, and we ourselves are critical friends of that.

Farmers in my region feel completely abandoned and truly insulted by the fact that some MEPs pretend that they do not know what they are doing and that they have to tell them that they are doing.

I am voting in favour of all the proposals presented in this report for the recovery of the European economy through greater financial support for energy projects.

Only once we know all the tenants and achievements can we talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law.
I repeat: absolutely not.
There is also an urgent need, especially in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference, for the European Union and other international players to articulate their policies on international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development.
I would like to quote a statement from Commissioner Rehn, whom I personally believe and who said that Nigeria is a very poor country: it is not true, Nigeria is a very rich country, but it is appalled by a corrupt and incompetent leader class that plundered the country's resources by impoverishing millions of citizens.
Finally, Mr M√∂lzer, I mean not being as pessimistic.
I therefore call on the Council to give a quick opinion on Parliament's new proposal to benefit from the measures announced for 2010, and I call on the Commission to ensure that the social and environmental requirements are met by non-ACP producing and exporting countries are met.
This requires the Commission - as coordinator of the Energy Community - to take Ukraine out of hand in order to remind it of its obligations with regard to security of supply to Europe.
We regret, of course, the victims of all the aggressive and authoritarian regimes, not to mention the atrocities committed in Europe or, for example, in former European colonies.
The main objective of the regulation must be to establish a new collective culture of control and responsibility rather than imposing a bureaucratic and costly process for verifying each product.
Member of the Commission. - The current EU competition policy on vertical agreements is very much in favour of Internet sales, and I am sure you are aware of this, Mr President.
On the other hand, the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third mistake and they are all moving in the right direction.
With regard to transport, much more needs to be done to establish restrictions on vehicle producers so that they are more fuel efficient.
in writing. - (ET) The financial situation in some euro area countries, which are being examined today, clearly shows the risks involved in moving away from the agreements concluded in the Stability and Growth Pact.
That is why I think it would be appropriate to consider how we can best use the financial resources saved to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery so as to include a new - apparently necessary - financial instrument to support energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewable energy.
The Commission and Parliament have deliberately chosen not to address the whole issue of fund management at all, because we are assuming that the industry will keep its promise to deal with this issue itself, without any legislative pressure.
This brings me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, with regard to the manufacturing industry, I should remind the House that Pakistan is the world's fourth largest cotton producer, with 9% of global production, before the European Union and its approximately 5.5%.

These objectives, President of the Commission and President of the Council, have been formulated in the objectives for 2020.
We are already working with many Arab countries on initiatives for gas transmission via Turkey and, hopefully, the Nabucco pipeline.

I am aware that, at the moment, electoral rules vary greatly from one Member State to another.
Apparently many generalist doctors are beginning to deal with anti-dementia medicines too late, so that they do not exceed their budget, and that is counterproductive.
Paradoxically, some people could, in fact, make distracted use of this instrument, not only from extremists, but also from very powerful and robust interest groups, and this is precisely because we believe that a threshold of 1 000 declarations of support is not high when compared to the demographic potential of the Union.
The 2010 budget introduces this systematic approach.
According to a report from the UN working group, victims of trafficking come from different social backgrounds, from the richest to the poorest, neediest to analabian women, from young women to older women.
This is, in fact, an important issue.
We need broadened and improved European economic governance to allow national actions to support this approach and I call on the Commission to carefully consider the possibility of a tax on financial transactions, including in a European context.
I think that mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because it is not just healthcare, but also care monitoring, but we have some time for that.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports, which raise important questions about the contribution of the European Union's trade policy in achieving certain fundamental objectives of general policy: respect for human rights, the search for economic wellbeing, social justice and sustainable growth, as well as respect for the climate system and especially.
Consumers will have access to different avenues of redress in the event of purchasing a product that is not in line with the contract and will be able to claim compensation if the means of redress have not yielded results.

It was for most people in Britain who were trafficked within the United Kingdom and not an external supply, if you do not do so.
(FR) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is renowing with growth in the third quarter of 2009, which could give us the impression that the worst is behind us.
In this context, Greece is being called on to adopt a comprehensive set of structural reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of public administration, strengthening pension and healthcare reform, improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the system of wage bargaining, improving the functioning of the market for products and the environment of businesses and preserving the stability of the banking and financial sector.

I believe that moving towards a sustainable and green economy will even be made without imposing excessive legislative measures.
Everyone seems to have forgotten the role played by the United States and, of course, by NATO in maintaining this peace in Europe.
I think we should think about all this as an ideal opportunity to deal with what Europe desperately needs: economic growth, jobs, a sector of dynamic small businesses, more innovations and more efficient public procurement, and our citizens will judge that.
I do not think it is up to us to pre-empt the possible developments in these countries.
The second project is concessions.
Madam President, at the European elections in 2004, Ireland introduced a smoking ban on the workplace, and we met many angry constituents with restaurants and drink debits.
In fact, at a time of profound contrition from the Member States with regard to their action, the increase in the EU budget represents an act of confidence in the joint project and the strengthening of action taken at supranational level.
I know that our message is exemplary, so let us not hesitate to misuse it.
This report sets out guidelines on how air agreements should be evaluated, both in terms of substance and in terms of the procedures to be followed.
The language law creates an imbalance.
Perhaps once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force definitively on 1 December, the internal British political debate will also be able to stay on the gates of this House?
So that is what the gap exists between the reality of the situation and the dream as this House lives here.
In addition, we agree on the need to involve each of the national parliaments fully, in accordance with their budgetary and control rights, in order to increase transparency, ownership and responsibility for each decision taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, there are five more than two questions that have been asked about economic governance and Europe 2020.
Therefore, I believe that we should actively involve national authorities, the European Commission and MEPs in promoting SOLVIT.
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines and now, Mr Michel, on protagonists and liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation: the promotion of the agro-industrial model, compatible with the protection of the interests of the large agri-food industry, and the impoverishment of the global agricultural sector; years and years of inappropriate investment, and the abandonment of small-scale and medium-sized farming sector.
Economically, producers are paid below their production costs, and the CAP must enable this to be resolved.
I call once again on the Commission to exert continuous pressure in its contacts with the government to carry out this commitment until it features in Congolese legislation.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I fully understand the particular interest this Parliament has shown in the action taken within the Union and beyond in tackling the challenges faced by some Member States with regard to their public finances.
We express our sympathy with the will of the nations that want a better life and future, and want to win their autonomy.
You even have the support of the Irish EPP.
This new dimension of European foreign policy should, and indeed, work on it to achieve a freer, fairer and more social world in the future.
It is my office, which is the author of the official document on sanctions against Syria, we are instead of the pilot.
The day when we will finally be rid of poverty, the spectrum of Communism will disappear for good.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B7-0565/2010), on the review of the competition rules on horizontal cooperation.
That is what you fought for together, wheat and oranes.
I believe that this procedure, as well as the strengthening of food safety within the EU, introduces greater clarity for Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU.
In these circumstances, it seems unwise to pursue a Mercosur agreement, especially when the Swedish Institute of Food and Technology has shown that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef.
With the Council's agreement, the following text should therefore be added at the bottom of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, in accordance with Article 1 (2) (b)) of the amended regulation:'The same benchmarks for the annual review of the charges set out in Articles 4 (3), 4 and 6 (3), when they are formulated in other euro'.
He is asking today and is rightly receiving European solidarity.
Take it a moment in Ireland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis: its accession to the monetary union has protected it from an even greater crisis.
He is afraid of German claims on goods belonging to the Sudeten and, having heard some German politicians speak on this subject, I believe that he has every reason to be intimate.
increased support from the European Investment Bank, as well as the European Investment Fund, and greater financial support for technical activities linked to the preparation and implementation of projects;
If we do not take measures that will make countries realise that there will be serious consequences if they conduct economically irrational policies, we will not get anywhere.
We need to improve and encourage activities aimed at combating climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always complex dossiers, I have enjoyed excellent cooperation from my own shadow rapporteurs, Mr Bernadette Vergnaud, Mr Bu≈üoi and Mr R√ºhle.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media are really a major problem.
Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two main instruments put in place by the Council of Europe.
It is therefore a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange views on the topics that are of concern to us.
Third area: sustainability, so that those who already have a job are given protection and help right now to ensure that they do not lose that job and that they will then follow a recycling cycle and upgrading skills in one or two years' time to find another; and the need to maintain existing jobs.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, our questions have been raised with the aim of increasing the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package and what we can bring to it.
I voted in favour of this report as it also makes some sensitive improvements to the European Commission's text, particularly with regard to data protection for natural persons.
In addition, we undertook a revision of the funds unused in 2009, so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 450 million for broadband Internet in category II could have been put in place.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for your very clear message.
We can see this in this document, as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach, an attempt that has not been successful but is nevertheless on the right track.
I would like once again to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a bit unadmitted, and the Council, where we attempted to find sensible solutions in Turkish sittings and at many meetings in the trialogue, because just a short while ago they also approved the reasonable compromise that we reached.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated initiatives, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, set up a European Aviation Coordination Board in the event of a crisis at the meeting of the Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010.
It is also important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself, illegal logging in this case, which creates the conditions for the illegal trade in timber.
I come from a country, Portugal, and from a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important, which is rooted in socially fragile regions, and where it would, in fact, be vital to maintain the quota regime beyond 2015.
People are not different because their cultures differ; it is cultures that differ due to differences between individuals.
In some cases, the quality of these proposals requires us to take them into account.
(SV) Mr President, given its people, Iceland, with its around three hundred thousand inhabitants, represents a small country, but it is a large nation.
Mr President, MEPs have a leading role to play in controlling health claims decisions.
For this reason, we say resolutely'yes' to Nabucco, but no less resolute'is our decision to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our people.
Political parties risk the ban; the justice system is corrupt; there are violations of human rights; freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are not comparable to what we know in Britain and in most other European countries.
It is also clear that we need an energy mix that consists of various energy sources and is as broad as possible, in the sense that this will stabilise the energy situation and, therefore, the diversity of each nation, of Europe, thereby realising itself fully.
However, I have doubts when this Parliament invoks international law to condemn certain unpleasant practices, while the legal basis is far from clear.
in writing. - (FR) With my support for this resolution on Tunisia, I unequivocally express my full solidarity with the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution that this people have brought to an end.
It also calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies, such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy insecurity, and to report regularly on their actions to resolve this problem.
If you pass a law by the Hungarian Parliament by decreing that this law can only be amended by a two-thirds majority, you know that it will not be easy to change after the next election.
generalised tariff preferences
Today in plenary, we voted on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for construction products.
Another serious problem is the question of a new sense of mutual trust.
We have spent EUR 9.5 million this year on the EEAS, but we will be able to evaluate the real costs after a year of operation, when a report on all the related expenditure on the work of the EEAS is presented to the European Parliament.
My question concerns Pakistan, which we all know is that chronic instability is a crisis factor for the whole region and for Afghanistan as well.
Of course, we cannot ignore the natural biological differences that exist between men and women.
Neither should we forget these factors, especially with regard to the idea contained in the proposal and the allocation of revenue obtained from infrastructure charges.
(HU) Mr President, what I welcome in this directive is the clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of interminable waiting lists and the proposed solution to the question of non-availability of professionals in its own country.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to make a few comments directly on the topics and questions that have been raised.
Last week in committee, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a ghost Presidency.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran as I am concerned about the continuing human rights violations in that country, particularly with regard to freedom of association, expression and information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.
In particular, fast-start financing will be crucial.
To create such a mechanism, it is one thing, but it must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens so that they can take full advantage of it.
This agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive, but will also make them safer, because the regulatory and control authorities are moving closer and cooperating in all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement in order to guarantee the highest level of safety for passengers and freight flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament is able to hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).
What is more, its private aspect improves Europe's image in the world and promotes European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating aims to amend the approved regulation in 2004, which improved and harmonised the security regulations for the protection of passports and travel documents for EU citizens against fraudulent use, while introducing biometric identification elements.
Secondly, we need to create some sort of temporary institutional framework for the mechanism for implementing decisions.
That said, there are some positive aspects: some of the agreements we have reached recently are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important that Parliament once again reminds the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will understand that it is much more effective to work constructively with the European Union, as it is doing at the moment, than to constantly try to recribe history.
The European Commission has so far found neither the necessary arguments nor the time to influence the Latvian Government in order to put an end to this discrimination on the basis of language.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make every effort, whatever it may be, to the Pakistani Government to urgently abolish this pernicious discrimination against the country's religious minorities.
This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
This is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for it.
Now more clearly than ever, we need financial institutions to stop and reassess their approach.
Our common objective is to reduce by-catches and discards, which we succeeded in the committee.
The main objective of trade aid is to revive the competitiveness of 40 countries at national and international level.
Although we accept the premisery of the rationality of internalisation of external costs, it is ultimately untenable to penalise only heavy goods vehicles and not passenger cars, with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion; even the good old'polluter pays' principle is clearly applied discriminatory.
I was encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate.
Then, when we look at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States, whether centre-right or the centre-left, is to safeguard the continued profitability of the monopolies by rejecting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on the working classes throughout the European Union.
Therefore, good practices should be promoted and local decision makers should be made aware of the potential of ICT to exploit.
Mr President, we could not hear the interpretation in English of the previous speech.
However, there is a very important aspect of this redesign, of this codification, which relates to the whole restructuring of the TN-T networks over the next 10 years.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is of crucial importance to the people of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also very important for the people of the European Union, as Ukraine is an important partner, particularly with regard to the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
That is why the Commission must speak with a strong voice.
We cannot interfere on an issue where the US Government is alone competent.
Those who manage our forests are poorly paid or not at all for these invisible services that many of us consider to be self-evident.
Unfortunately, it must also be said that the list of unresolved issues is going to increase, not to be reduced.
In light of the excellent report by Mr Salafranca on the European strategy for relations with Latin America, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission, both represented in Baroness Ashton, to take urgent action in three particular areas.
There are large dealers, very present on the market in certain Member States, and there are also many small dealers who prefer our present proposals to what was put in place in 2002, because they saw that certain aspects, not only did they not want from the legislator in 2002, were not only in favour, but put them in the driver's seat on big dealers.
It must build this' EU regional political partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', which the Committee on Development launched by adopting its report in April 2007.
In all these years, and especially after the historical enlargement of 2004, the context and ambitions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) have evolved considerably.
Spain is echoing the flames of the Presidency of the European Union just when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force.
In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda, and that it is one of the priority actions of the Single Market Act.
I would like to emphatically support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission proposal has been amended in accordance with the report currently voted on, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore crucial that we reach an agreement at first reading.
These are the people who are most in need and they must not be excluded on the basis of the place where they live.
Any medical assistance, regardless of its particular characteristics, comes under the Treaty on European Union.
However, I would like to alert the House to the fact that a recent study by the European cardiology Society has once again demonstrated the high limits of this methodology, given the low levels of participation of women in such tests.
The idea is not only to use investment agreements to achieve our social objectives, but these agreements should also prevent us from achieving our social and environmental objectives.
I call for greater importance to be given to the recovery of organic waste, especially in this largely agricultural region, to verify data and establish a system for exchanging good practices.
The law stipulating that all priests, bishops and Orthodox patriots must be Turkish nationals is absolutely incomprehensible.
The most significant point in this position adopted by Parliament is the attention it pays to the measures being dispersed, which can therefore lack cohesion, not only as a law-making arsenal but especially in terms of implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has enabled the European Union to accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least the issue of the digital single market has achieved a breakthrough in the EU's priorities.
This would be a major step forward towards transparency, openness and clarity in the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I am in favour of the proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), because it is an excellent idea to discuss it.
Is this model of economic development that Europe must offer to Europeans?
As a rule, I do not allow the speakers to exceed the time allotted, but I think we all accept that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important for us.
We want a good strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, a strategy which, once implemented, will improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region.
This is indeed a great achievement because, without getting into legal considerations, this directive recognises the irrefutable rights of patients and opens up a wide range of opportunities for their access to better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors was unable to give us satisfaction about the legal and regular nature of expenditure relating to the EU budget; I was particularly concerned about the lack of control of taxpayers' money when I had the functions of the European Commission's accounts in 2002.
For me, this is a huge challenge and a great honour.
If we want to be honest, we have to recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and admit that our per capita emissions are still much higher than China or India, for example.
I am certain that the dialogue that will be following will be constructive.
We therefore regret, like Europol, that the rush is taking the lead in guaranteeing fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposal to add a simpler method of using funds from the European Social Fund, so that the response to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing is quicker and more effective.
Quite honestly, I would have voted against the Commission's proposal, but alongside lower candidates, there were also very good ones, including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
You are very gentle, Mr Kirkhope, but apart from Britain, there are, in fact, also 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that, if we are very sensitive to the concerns you have expressed, I must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I think we should be careful here to maintain the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian response, even though sometimes it is difficult in crisis areas.
It also adds new points to what Parliament has already said, for example, by calling on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to evaluate the results of the investigations carried out by all the parties and to report by the European Union's High Representative and its Member States, which call for the responsibility and credibility of the investigations, and which express its concern about the pressure that has been brought about in the Goldstone report, including the restrictions.
I also hope that this decision will help save endangered species.
I hope that you will not take my questions as a provocation, but as help in reflection.
I am ready - and hope to be able to do so - to come back to what we have conclusions, but we have to check what we find ourselves.
This result will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in international trade talks, including in the current WTO Doha negotiations.
If Europe speaks with one voice, the United States will also adopt this same goal.
That is why, as far as I am concerned, I support the prices set for European tobacco growers, so far as it will eat smoking in Europe at least.
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
Therefore, I would like the European Social Fund (ESF) to be independent and separate from European structural policy.
The number of new contaminations continues to pre-empt the dissemination of treatment and, in 2009, the two thirds of people in need of treatment still did not have access to it, which produced 10 million people at a lack of effective treatment.
In fact, when the dignity of the human person is recovered, we do not look at the minorities at the very least from a negative viewpoint.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
All EU institutions must, in future, ensure that our budgets are there to help citizens and businesses through economic difficulties and to consider recovery.
The fastest way to bring these parties together is to support civil initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions by far more effectively and practising measures.
To those who are still now against this treaty because they wrongly believe that this Treaty reinforces the European Union, I would say this: those who reject this Treaty are in fact strengthening our so-called partners, or, if you like, our opponents.
By embracing global capitalism, the European Union will stifle us all.
We will soon have a meeting on the TEN-T and the Commission will take the opportunity to move forward on the matter of developing a network that involves other modes of transport.
You may remember that the struggle was daunting since it came before the Court of Justice, and that the Commission - and I pay tribute here to the Commission - was lucidly, more lucid at that time than the Council, and we fully supported the Commission.
The first person to ask for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, the line adopted today by the governments of the main EU Member States, the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified.
I would like to remind Parliament that, according to recent recensations, the European Union has even more than 20 million unemployed, and this figure is probably 25 million today, which means that attracting even more asylum seekers is a kind of collective suicide.
It is the Commission that must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
For its economic recovery, Sri Lanka depends on EU direct investment and economic aid.
We fully support the objective of the vaccination initiative, but could not accept the reference made to another Parliament's vote which, among other things, supports abortion and goes against an explanation of vote that we have seen before in Parliament's report.
This document is the result of a compromise, a result of long negotiations, which improves respect for passenger rights without placing any additional burden on carriers.
It is, in fact, high time to breathe life into the'E' of EMU through the creation of a real and effective economic union as a final step in the integration of European economic policy.
I have been particularly interested in the question of the rights of the child in the context of external relations.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, for over a decade now, the European Union has been trying to provide itself with legislative instruments for economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a valuable instrument for removing national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products within the European Union and for continuing the construction of a single market in this sector.
By the way of returning irregular migrants to our territory, I believe that there is still a very long way to go, if we really want to follow the objectives that are assigned to our foreign policy by the treaties.
That is why I supported the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships under the umbrella of the Innovation Union Initiative, and I think we should all be involved in innovation action, because, as I said, it is very important for the future.
We have a newly elected government in the United Kingdom that has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Lu√≠s Paulo Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 establishing specific measures in the area of agriculture for the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand to produce good results both in terms of environment and job creation.
Some countries do not use all the ESF funds that are given to them, 30% or 40% unspent.
All of this leads me, in fact, to wonder - even though the Commission said that it had information and that it published it, because there is an obligation to publish them - why this fact, for example, was not known.
I call for one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal for an effective information campaign to increase the visibility of the points of single contact.
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and want to make implementation of economic policy objectives obligatory.
in writing. - (DE) Today, I voted in favour of the establishment of enhanced cooperation on unitary patent protection because I believe that the impasse in the Council caused by the language regime is unjustified.
I repeat: the Treaty clearly states that a state cannot be forced to take on debt.
I would remind you that the European Parliament and the Council have together decided to devote 2010 the'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion'.
I would like to assure this Parliament that we will continue to address these issues, including at the highest level, by reminding the People's Republic of China of China of its international human rights obligations.
I hope, and I am convinced, that your votes will lay the foundations for an agreement.
First of all, I regret that Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner, is not here with us, but the House of Commons has perhaps already begun to attend us.
Perhaps you do not know, but to check such statements, for example, it is necessary to carry out large-scale animal testing.
I am somewhat perplexed, Commissioner, about the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of industry in the process which is started here.
We do not agree with that.
The European aid earmarked for the 2007-2010 period aimed at supporting the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova is more than EUR 50 million.
Of course, we cannot understand that an illegal worker can find work and the person in employment so that he can cover the costs of residence and survival is ultimately punished.
I believe that this measuring system based on the correlation of different parameters of study will ensure that political decisions are better adapted to the needs of society and of the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to point out that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be directly dependent on lifting restrictions on freedoms and stopping the repression of participants in peaceful actions and human rights defenders.
Finally, High Representative, you are going to visit the Middle East.
Worse still, by turn, the US Congress passed the law on the protection of US services one month after the establishment of the ICC in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to explain briefly that this report includes the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, following the resolution adopted on 19 June 2008 at the plenary session, which rejected the Commission's proposal to allow the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption, even after micro-treatment.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my sincere condolences for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deep concern about the four other Cuban prisoners and opposition activists who have also started a hunger strike as a sign of protest.
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should be not to squander one cent.
The Union, especially the Mediterranean countries, has always been at the forefront of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity towards people living in such difficult conditions is fundamental.
Generally speaking, these workers themselves are isolated and it is very difficult for them to enter into trade unions.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, as things stand, and even though some of the amendments came to improving it, Mrs Guillaume's report is a real incentive to use this procedure, including responsible services and depriving those who really need them of rapid examination of their dossier.
It is our responsibility and responsibility to do everything we can and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work, which does us all well.
We have really done a lot of work on important and significant reports.
'social dumping'poses a major threat to workers, as it fundamentally undermines their rights.
The Commission and the Council must redouble their efforts to ensure respect for human rights in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, I should like to ask, as regards the Commissioner's comments on the evaluation of each proposal, whether an ex-ante study can be carried out for the region in question, including on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the particular character of the region, in order to find criteria that each country will have to take into account right from the outset and which it will have to comply with its timetable.
We also need to look at the issue of Roma women, who are experiencing specific problems of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, as well as the problem of young Roma, because their lack of complicated qualifications are more accessible to employment at a time of economic crisis.
I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the regulation of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in order to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector and thus help marginalised communities throughout the Member States.
It is also a reminder to all political decision makers, who have a role to play within the boundaries of their area of competence, so that freedom of the press becomes a reality, and the public authorities must be ready to protect freedom of expression and encourage development.
Mr President, I think that the European Union has become far too large, has too many cultures, and I simply do not have faith in this system and I believe that the situation will get worse.
It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis and every stage of this process requires unanimity in the Council, which the honourable Member is not unaware of.
It is important to note that the EU integration prospects serve as a strong incentive for the Balkan countries to undertake the necessary reforms and they are also a factor in regional stability.
Now that advertising plays a more important role than ever, it is essential that we define the criteria for consumers and patients to be fully and safely aware of the types of impact these medicines can have.
To repeat Neil Armstrong's words, it would be a small step for European funds, but a giant step for the European economy.
Thirdly, breaches in security which, according to some people, will see the light of day if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement, simply do not exist.
In addition, the rapid expansion of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has increased the supply of online gambling and has caused the emergence of cross-border problems that remain to be resolved.
Anyone who makes decisions in this area should have equal access to professional information about the country of origin of the petitioner and the bodies entitled to consider appeals, as indeed the applicants themselves do.
That is to say that I appreciate, after all these years, the important step that the only multinational parliament in the world was to be elected by universal suffrage.
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence, and these EUR 200 billion must be spent more effectively than in the past.
Together, we have made progress.
In addition, we are going to work in this parliamentary term on services of general interest.
May I therefore be able to formulate reproaches to Mr Almunia, for example, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who was very critical of some countries when he was carrying out this function, just before the Greek question came to the fore.
There is a massive need for reforms of this kind in Turkey.
Other EU countries, such as Portugal and Spain, have already benefited from EGF support, so that we can also grant this aid to Lithuania.
Combining spent and radioactive waste (debate)
I would just like to mention the most recent episodes, such as the demolishing demolition of the town of Vinh Long, replaced by a public park, or the deployment of anti-grip police officers and buldozers to remove the status of the Catholic Marie Rrain of Hanoi.
Furthermore, this fund plays a significant role in the areas of educating workers, lifelong learning, improving working opportunities and integrating workers into the labour market.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes

That has now been done, with my support in the vote.
There is only one solution: growth.
