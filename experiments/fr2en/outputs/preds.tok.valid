Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report under discussion on Wednesday in the European Parliament draw our attention to the fact that imported agricultural products from third countries damage the environment more than domestic production , which is subject to stricter regulations for reducing carbon dioxide emissions which promote climate change .
It is , in fact , hard to accept that the recipient countries are not in a position to have this money in place .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime institutions of the Member States must work much closer together to harmonise their training programmes and offer opportunities for gainful apprenticeships and exchanges of experience with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we can see is that we are increasingly demanding more from farmers .
Frontex must be supported and the EU must also oblige the authorities of the Member States to take responsibility .
I would like to add one more thing that no one except Commissioner Almunia has so far addressed .
in writing . - ( RO ) The sensitive areas of climate change are mainly the following : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , without forgetting public health , of course .
Let me also express my personal sadness , but also on behalf of the Commission , regarding the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendarm following last week &apos;s terrorist attacks .
Well , Commissioner Piebalgs , for everything you do .
However , it is comforting that , following the opposition and the concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education about the devaluation of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is getting worse and is having problems in many Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported , and initially increased the appropriations for the entire budget under 202 .
A minority government , a completely different political spectrum , then took power , but no one called it a &apos; coup &apos; .
The fact that the international community felt that the question of Abyei had not been resolved in the referendum indicates , in fact , a total lack of responsibility and represents the recipe of a new war .
The case of the Romanian handball Marian Cozma hemail , which has been brutally murdered by two members of the Roma community in Hungary , once again shows us that the crime knows no borders and that denying the problems posed by this community is counterproductive .
A strong European food policy is needed .
The Treaty of Lisbon should go hand in hand with a new political model in Europe , both with regard to the need to pool the resources of the Member States in order to achieve opoptimal results and work on shared strategies and operations , which will make Europe the political union that its founding fathers dreamed years ago .
That is the request that we make .
We are all in favour of the single market , and Hungary has been so since the beginning .
Climate change inevitable requires society and the European economy to adapt to a new reality .
The Sahel countries will continue to promote internal stability and will work to find socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It has been a fine story of three years &apos; love , like most amour tories , and I am pleased that it has come to an end .
The need for NATO to maintain constant vigilance and support , especially in Afghanistan at the moment , is essential .
However , something needs to happen , and we need to move on .
In this regard , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , exemptions of the regime , the possibility of setting a maximum rate and , last but not least , the place of taxation of intra-EU delivery , will have to be addressed .
Let me briefly describe the situation in the West Midlands : we have the highest rate of youth unemployment and our car industry was decided , partly because the European Union financed a factory in Slovakia , where the main jobs from the Ryton plant were relocated .
It is essential to ensure that these young institutions are not constrained by the threat of weakening or undermining the fundamental rules for reforming the financial sector .
That is enough !
We should also facilitate the creation of a network bringing together the various research papers , so that they can use specialist joint infrastructures and exchange relevant information and data .
Qimonda is therefore perfectly in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I fully support the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office , as the situation in certain third countries , especially Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating .
Mr Severin observed very well the strategic reciprocity that wants Europe to need a strong United States , and that the United States needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask the Council whether it can tell us what proportion of refugees will be included in the resettlement programme .
I am convinced that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to lift this visa requirement .
Ultimately , the discovery has not been produced either by a food inspector or by an EU food safety agency , but by the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
That is why we need to use our vision of military capacity centred on soft power and prevention to promote a new agenda , which already existed but which became clear in Munich , because the policies of President Obama allow us to enter a new era of disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been prepared for some time now in the Committee on Budgets .
In September , the Members of the MoDem Parliament did not vote in favour of Barroso chairing the Commission , with his balance sheet not calling for his reversation .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that animal welfare is the main objective , that animals live in conditions adapted to their species , and that animals are vigorous and robust according to the principle that prevention is better than cure .
Now we fear that , in the event of an extension of the scope of this directive , it will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , this text would again be blocked by the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians , Member States and the European Union place small and medium-sized enterprises at the centre of their efforts to promote economic recovery .
The United Kingdom and the United Kingdom and the United States , both of which deficits exceed 10 % , will have to switch by means of a major adjustment in order to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep things separated , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new Hungarian media law , and I do not think that this is his responsibility .
Clearly , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
In addition to insulting the wine growers involved in a quality policy , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product from the mixing of finished products and allow misleading reference to the cutting of ros√© wine .
But we still have a great deal of work to do .
What is going to happen is that there will be job losses across rural Europe and a reduction in our food production capacity .
However , let us not forget that , despite these institutional issues , this Swedish Presidency , in the autumn , is , of course , very strongly affected by the need to move forward on the issue of climate change , through the need for progress on the issue of the financial crisis , through the concern that Europe represents for us to have a policy of job creation , so many important issues that need to be addressed .
However , do believe that we are very well aware that there will be a number of key texts for this police and judicial cooperation , which will have to find a new basis for this cooperation which , in this way , will enable Parliament to exercise its role as colegislator .
I would also like to applaud the rapporteurs for leaving aside the ethical aspects , which naturally fall within the competence of the Member States .
This is a good thing because it is after all young people who will decide on the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must not forget those who have already made a very important contribution to the integration of Europe .
In other words , we are establishing an economic recovery plan that provides for three and a half billion euros for the energy giant oligarchy and not a single euro for the partners we need to secure the transition to green energy .
Fishing quotas and stock management are essential in order to avoid total depletion of fish stocks in internal waters and oceans .
We would have preferred Parliament &apos;s resources to have been increased by means of redistributions and measures aimed at improving efficiency , rather than increasing the total budget .
This package would also demonstrate that the European institutions can work responsibly , effectively and constructively together in such an important area .
That is the approach head-on , that is , the improvement of first-instance procedures , favoured by the Commission in its recast proposal , which , in my opinion , will enable real economies of scale to be achieved in the medium term .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and have reached a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to outsource European jobs to countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we do .
All contributions have been helpful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is deteriorating significantly .
They must work hard to achieve a understanding between 27 Member States , to reflect Europe &apos;s unity and its willingness to overcome the crisis and to safeguard the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament for democracy and human rights and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the most important economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At the time , this money was exclusively intended for two types of projects : those aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , and the construction of wind parks in the North Sea .
If it were proposed that EGF money should be given to workers made redundant in Britain , we would vote for it to be allocated and we would be criticised if we did not do so .
With regard to the Court &apos;s activities , we know that it is fully operational , but it is still the first step .
This programme concerns our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , but also the most distant ones such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Together with my colleagues in the Commission , I am particularly vigilant that gender mainstreaming is part of all the policies that we are proposing .
These projects will help to overcome the differences in connection between European Union systems and enable the best use of the European Union &apos;s own energy resources .
Then this is a political move , and I think that Europe needs , first and foremost , more policy , and that is certainly also one of our Parliament &apos;s responsibilities .
Let us also think that FIFA has not succeeded in introducing the technology for monitoring the line when other ports have done so .
After all , we are able to organise various types of training or workshops where we can provide real support in accessing EU funds earmarked for rural development .
There are others who use the absence of this policy as a pretext for reasons for their bilateral agreements with suppliers that often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
I am also pleased that we have been able to establish a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on legislative programming .
In particular , many Member States have made a huge effort to meet their obligations to the Pact .
The aim being to enable the EU to respond to the major challenges of society that affect all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone ( ageing population and health , energy supply , water or food supply , sustainable development , the fight against climate change , etc . ) and to develop knowledge so that businesses can innovate more and increase their competitiveness .
If we support the resolution tomorrow , I think there are some inconsistencies in this budget , and I would like to highlight two of them which I believe are the main ones .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I sincerely thank the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will make progress on the governance of the world economy , including financial regulation and timely follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to look at this in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to help them reintegrate into the labour market .
The bottom line is the will of Europeans not to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment , which would inevitably result from accession .
This is an ingrading and difficult role .
That is our top priority .
However , the support of the European Union is essential for the country &apos;s independence .
The Israeli Government continues to carry on with its crackdown colonisations and after committing war crimes at the beginning of this year .
In view of the results of the evaluations and additional visits carried out by teams of experts , it can be seen that Bulgaria and Romania were ready to join the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal retains the five longliners it had previously had .
the increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities which will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would also like to emphasise the contradiction between Pakistan &apos;s government &apos;s commitment to religious freedom and its decisive role on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in approving the UN programme of &apos; combating the defamation of religion &apos; .
I say this this this afternoon because I think it is really important .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is satisfactory because it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , swift and coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is absolutely essential , including the introduction of old vehicles &apos; return programmes in exchange for a significant reduction in the purchase price of new ones , financial support , etc .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is correct , but it does not appear to be very compatible with the entry into force , more than laudable , of the Treaty of Lisbon , when the functions and powers currently shared between the two pillars will be consolidated .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure is the question &apos; .
If the industry &apos;s players , from fishermen to traders who sell fish to consumers , do not comply with the rules , this policy is doomed to failure .
At these sittings of expensive and inefficient jargon of a Parliament , hidden but illusory illusion of a responsible democracy , and a huge disappointment for the voters who brought us here .
This is unfortunate because it seems that , on this issue , we should be united .
We have stopped saying that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe , in which somehow , we are being motivated by this because the climate issue must take priority .
The burden of debt - which we see the stigma - is hampering economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this report will help clarify the various air agreements and deal with them in the simplest way , as well as pointing out which criteria we have to pay attention and which aspects we have to follow .
I will vote in favour of the telecom package , but I will do so with some reluctance , because I believe that at the highest level , it fundamentally concerns the essential principle of the liberalisation of telecommunications that this directive was intended to achieve .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
Their impact will be greater and the cost to taxpayers will be less if we are able to coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to facilitate the obtaining of European visas for Belarusians and a readmission agreement .
Let me give a specific example .
Let us take a look at the education of children and educational institutions for example .
We also do not know at this stage whether the standards we promote in the area of legal trade in timber will enter into force and work globally - some speakers have already highlighted this problem .
The creation of the Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis , as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to support sustainable qualitative growth , is essential .
I voted in favour of changing the rules on vaccination against bluetongue to enable more effective use of vaccines and reduce administrative formalities for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for strong integrated Community policies to be put in place .
By abstaining , I would like to express my profound disappointment at the summit , which is far from the expectations of our citizens .
Late payments are frequently the cause of difficulties both in the internal market and in international trade .
Of course , we need a policy of budgetary responsibility and rigour , no one disputes that , but we must not put all efforts on the citizens , who are our only opportunity to be able to get out of this crisis by the High Representative .
The United States has an early warning system for this purpose .
That is what happened to one of my own electorate , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy .
That is what the Europeans have asked for by electing this Parliament and that is what we must give them if , in five years &apos; time , there are more and more of them in the ballot box .
The parts of the text within the competence of the European Council have been examined and they have been approved by the European Council itself .
Ultimately , private consumption expenditure has risen by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At the moment , I think it would be useful to think about how we can enforce existing legislation .
The summit &apos;s conclusions in this regard are very vague .
To this end , the proposal offers uniform instruments for the adoption of conservative or executive measures , in order to avoid problems linked to recognition and translation of acts from other Member States , as well as a form of notification of documents relating to the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget as important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can help Member States , through financial programmes , to cooperate at European level .
For example , the decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 of the Council established the capacity of the Member States to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level in order to prosecute these crimes , which are , and is happy , even included in the legislation of certain Member States - we all remember the Pinochet case .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy &apos; base .
Our purchases are ever further away , and the Internet has now transformed our habits fully , not least because our lives have become ever more frequent .
With regard to information , we are passing on further information as we receive .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in the education of the young generation , and I am talking about lifelong learning .
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that these questions have found a satisfactory response in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre-left )
In this case , it is thousands of people who are involved , often with small children and without adequate financial means .
Procedures are completely different with regard to the Commission &apos;s question of the future provisions of the possible treaty and Parliament &apos;s questioning through the petitioner procedure .
All parties involved in the Middle East conflict must respect human rights .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece raised questions as to our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to take responsibility .
We know that UNESCO , on every occasion , describes the Chinese authorities the impact of development on Kashgar &apos;s traditional heritage and culture .
in writing . - The MEP Schwab proposed a report aimed at improving the safety of cars through the introduction of enhanced safety measures for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
If the economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , we have been able to act and we have improved our resistance .
If we discuss Parliament &apos;s position with external bodies , for example , with human rights organisations , who could feel involved , and if we fail to reach an agreement - even if I hope that this will not be the case - and if certain projects cannot be successful then , I believe that Parliament &apos;s position will be supported and understood once and .
Thursday afternoon &apos;s sittings are becoming increasingly surreal in this Chamber both by the vacuum we are seeing on the topics discussed and by how they are dealt with .
I believe that it is still impossible to know whether Moldova will be able to elect its President , and if that is not the case , the country will obviously have to hold new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union was established on 1 January 1999 , when 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency simultaneously .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome this compromise , because it raises the issue of the democratic deficits faced by women in particular for years , as they have been assisting their spouses engaged in self-employed activities as traders , craftsmen , SME or Liberal profession , without any recognition after years of work .
It is true that our policy options are notionally different , and sometimes differing .
I would call it &apos; climate justice &apos; because it concerns the relationship between developed and developing countries and the will to present a credible proposal for financing mitigation and adaptation measures , and how we show our will to lead by example .
I would therefore also like to see the Commission &apos;s position on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of State aid granted to the banks , which have benefited from it , but which have not taken any social initiative to support them .
I have not only three children , but also a small child who , for the moment , only drink milk .
We are ready to devise technical assistance programmes to support the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities must take .
We expect the Commission to develop it .
As you say , we need to keep updating our statistics from Eurostat .
Sometimes , I wonder if we have not learnt enough from the consequences of our actions , if we do not propose European solutions to European problems and we are trying to find specific solutions when the problem requires collective treatment .
There are also e-mails saying that scientists who questioned this hypothesis have also avoided peer review processes in order to avoid any deficiencies in this research being updated .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has informed this very gloomy part of the society with which we are still debating , and it is very bad .
We know the kind of people we are dealing with here and the institutions must therefore be aware , in relation to inspections , that they represent a greater risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections .
During the work of revising the RoHS Directive , our priority was to tighten safety standards to be applied to electrical appliances and electronic gadgets sold within the European Union .
Prevention work is carried out mainly in schools , because this social group is the most vulnerable in terms of drug addiction .
His enlargement after the Cold War brought together the continent and it is now being called upon to safeguard the successes of the past and continue with the integration phase right from a better time .
Many Members want questions to be answered this evening and out of respect for them , we want to proceed in an orderly manner .
However , those of us who attacked it knew that there was no alternative , that problems need to be resolved in this sector , and we hope that we are in the process of resolving some of the problems that have arisen by part of the dairy sector .
Secondly , while the ECR Group fully recognises the need for maternity and paternity provisions , we have chosen to abstain on the presence of references of this type in this report , because we do not want family policy , whatever it may be , to be dictated at Community level .
Last but not least , I think that the forthcoming discussions on this subject need to address the issue of the EUBAM Rafah mission : how this mission can be restored , and how it might be extended .
The Commission therefore monitors the situation and , if necessary , the Commission will act , but I believe that we should not go beyond the existing structures in Union law , and there is no doubt that the Commission will remain within the limits of Union law .
Because our common wish is for genuine European diplomacy , which is not just the diplomatic addition of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we are debating and voting on today , are of paramount importance .
in writing . - In the light of the persistent gap between men and women in terms of employment , wages and access to management posts , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislation .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really look forward to the Commissioner ensuring that no further progress will be made now , either in the next few weeks or in the future , unless these fugitives are handed out .
We will shortly look at this issue , as part of the discussions on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The European Parliament adopted , today , 20 October , the report by its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
We are already talking about tax increases that will be imposed in the near future in order to clean up public finances .
Today , the time has come for us to demand strongly that Christians and faithful beliefs be free to practise their religion .
In the EU , 31.5 % of employed women work part-time ( 30 hours or less per week ) , while the percentage is just 8.3 % among employed men .
I share the cautious optimism both of the Commissioner and of the Minister and I think we should look at a rcience , however , at many clears .
At the time , few of us would have predicted the scale of the economic crisis that we were expecting .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction , which shows that it is on the consumer side .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs R√ºhle and the shadow rapporteurs for this remarkable report .
This policy has become a key aspect of the economic recovery package , providing added value and supports efforts to promote the modernisation and sustainable economic growth , thus demonstrating economic solidarity .
However , we do not yet know - and unfortunately - whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon is going to apply , it is obvious that the Treaty in force must be applied without any hesitation .
I believe , however , that the situation clearly highlights the disastrous situation in the agricultural sector , especially in my region , when farmers are seen to take the lead for several days outside , in these months of winter , in an attempt to obtain the modest sums of European funding .
The Member States of southern Europe have expected too much .
This must be done within the framework of a strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will for a democratic vote , which is why tomorrow is such an important day .
It should be pointed out that providing a roof is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in a modern welfare state , is a very important one .
For me , the definition of priorities that are political in nature implies that they should be examined carefully and that they should be transparent and democratic .
This particular project relates to the deployment of the traffic management system .
( HU ) Over the last few months , an atmosphere of fear has again prevailed in Vojvodina , among the many nationalities living there , mainly Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have , on our behalf , achieved a concrete and practical result .
Although we agree with the wordings in the proposal providing for equal treatment between Parliament and the Council with regard to access to meetings and information , regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation with respect to citizens &apos; initiatives , with a view to the law &apos;s readiness , and not with regard to the need to the need to punishing of European law , but rather with the use of &apos; .
As you all know , without access to the spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum spectrum , Community policy aims to ensure that all market participants are given non-discriminatory access to spectrum .
This will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for the Commission &apos;s actions on equality between men and women in the areas my fellow Member just mentioned , from employment to other means through which it is important to ensure and guarantee equality .
We look forward to the other heavy political and economic goods vehicles also putting their offers on the table , which has not happened until now for many of them .
Dementia and , above all , Alzheimer &apos;s disease is not just a serious medical problem , but also a particularly sensitive ethical and social problem , the severity of which will rise proportionately to the ageing population of Europe .
I would also like to say that you have taken care to make it clear that the responsibility should not be confused and I definitely do not want to mix the responsibilities either , between the Member States and what is at European level .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs who took up all the details of this matter : Mr Sz√°jer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have provided a helping hand and , with the full support of the European institutions , please , Minsk , accept it , because you and the people of Belarus have a lot to gain from it .
We need to monitor the developments closely , because the President indicated that we could save European businesses EUR 38 billion a year .
Now , following the condemnation of Liu Xiaobo , we have even seen the ban by the police on homosexual celebration , which is clearly at risk of creating a freezing political environment in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , today &apos;s statement on Ukraine has been very clear .
We have to recognise here that this will only happen if the parliaments take part in it , as it is only thanks to them that it is possible to adapt the majority of the regulations properly and that this process and proposals for the transatlantic legislators &apos; dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of crucial importance .
Someone spoke of helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I was pleased to see you here and to hear what you said .
That is what I would like to highlight in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a strong signal to women who help their spouse in their self-employed work .
Anyone who has been there since the conflict can witness the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , from a strategic point of view , the relationship that the European Union has with the United States is the most important of all its relations .
Our ambition is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do any more and better with less money !
At the same time , the large number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting gives me hope that the action of such a large number of allies will end up being successful .
Mr President , I would like to take the floor to support the motion for a resolution not to vote because I heard Mr Schulz make a statement which , in my opinion , is very important : if we really want this debate to encompass the &apos; Europe &apos; and not just Italy , then there is no reason to vote on a resolution entitled &apos; freedom of information &apos; in Italy .
In view of these findings , I have decided to vote in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament proposes to approve the regulation submitted by the Council and not to delay any further , because the new regulation will simplify the management of procedures and ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals legally residing in the Union in the field of social security .
This figure is absolutely shocking and I also mentioned it in a report that I drafted during the previous term of this Parliament .
It is true , however , that a European Arctic policy may not be as strange as Baroness Ashton &apos;s nomination , which is completely incompetent , Sarah Palin from the former student left , as High Representative .
This is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union and must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party &apos;s amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that this is a reduction that we need and that the Conservative Party &apos;s position represents a starting point for negotiations that are too close .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I think we have attached far too little importance to the development of types of vehicles that are completely new : hydrogen cars , electric cars and cars with fuel piles .
Then we are going to separate ourselves .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
The European Union , as a partner of Thailand , remains ready to support it in accordance with its capabilities in this complex process .
Indeed , in order for this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth , to be of real benefit to local populations and not to harm the European fishing and canning industries , it was crucial to provide for an assessment as soon as possible of its effects and to allow for its suspension if necessary .
This is what the Commission and the Council are doing very laudable , so as to ensure that the supply of gas returns without delay ; of course , the threat of legal sanctions is hardly effective .
It is essential for Member States to investigate the extreme human rights violations against certain Roma women as soon as possible , to punish their perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and obtain redress .
( LT ) Mr President , this really is a fairly complex problem .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with the national supervisory authorities , but also - as has not been said - with the national parliaments and , in particular , the committees responsible for European affairs , budgets and budgetary control .
I will make the following suggestion to you , namely , now that the European External Action Service is setting out its rules on access to information and access to documents , so that it can make it a modern , citizen-friendly organisation that is not treating foreign policy , as if it were only within the remit of some diplomats acting in the greatest secrecy .
All countries are now changing their economic policies with the aim of emerging as soon as possible from the unfavourable economic situation in which they find themselves and at least of restoring a certain level of economic growth .
Let me also talk about the Japanese people .
Mr Barroso answered this as an internal problem .
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened , but rather preserved and consolidated .
It is no secret for anyone that our European identity directly causes it in the Christian tradition .
If it serves the large groups , it disorganises public transport , it is responsible for deteriorating the state of the network and security .
On the other hand , we cannot leave one side to discuss Turkey &apos;s future accession to the European Union .
This risk must be managed effectively , and this urgently , as the tragic events in Japan remind us of .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all the instruments handed down or transmitted to use in medical practice .
I hope to be able to travel to Albania next week and , in short , I can conclude my report this evening , but we cannot , either myself or the European institutions , consider work to be finalised without first completing a thorough study .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and to point out that my group - from the outset - accepted SIS II with a certain reserve , given the numerous implications for data protection .
The appropriate conditions must be met .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints , compared with 3 406 in 2008 , which represents a 9 % decrease .
In its October judgment , the European Court of Justice also clearly rejects this .
There is also considerable potential for the operation of EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety , environment and road traffic flow , through their provision for tolls .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for almost a third of the budget , the situation remains unchanged , since this is the only budget area where the error rate is estimated at more than 5 % .
I would also , of course , like to thank the rapporteurs for submitting a report supported by the majority of us .
I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Europe &apos;s conversion into a green economy proposed to get out of the crisis , based on energy , broadband networks and innovation , is not intended to protect the environment or meet the needs of the grassroots classes , but to allow large companies to conquer new , highly lucrative sectors .
That is why I share the concern you have expressed : that of seeing the important objectives of the Hungarian Presidency disrupted by national debates or specific features rather than unite .
I agree with the conditional payment of costs on the basis of the prior agreement in justified and precisely defined cases , when cross-border healthcare carries the stay of the patient for at least one night in hospital and requires expensive and highly specialised medical equipment or there is a particular risk to patients or the general population .
The most effective way to take the lead would have been , and is , to aim for a more stringent emissions reduction target of at least 30 % .
The abuse is harmful , especially to those involved who are making real efforts to mitigate environmental damage .
Of course , past visa scandals show how lax states are when it comes to issuing visas .
The people who are unemployed in rural areas , the need for funding , are once again left in their fate .
I know that you are capable of tackling these challenges .
- Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to welcome you warmly to the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orb√°n has not presented himself to the groups of the European Parliament as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fight &apos; for populist and nationalist accessors &apos; protecting the Hungarian people against &apos; attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I welcome this report and congratulate Mr Sz√°jer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s assistance to persuade Iran to abandon the construction of a nuclear bomb .
I am formally opposed to the Swiss idea of preventive bombing and NATO &apos;s intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for Europe &apos;s stability .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is a very important piece of work that enables us to establish a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
However , we are committed to establishing conditions for the fisheries sector to be sustainable and to developing in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in this wonderful region of the Arctic are rife , but there is also no doubt that , thanks to new technologies and progress , the exploitation of natural resources in this region will inevitably increase , including fishing .
Youth unemployment rates have risen by 20 % at the beginning of the year , resulting from the economic crisis , while the school drop-out rate has been 17 % , with young people in rural areas hardest hit by this problem .
The market is currently being invaded by labels , images and environmental texts that can be carried out by consumers , and this includes forest photos on drinks containing hazardous substances for certain alternatives or environmentally-friendly cars .
We voted against this proposal because it aims to ascribe to European countries rather than to the countries concerned , the critical situation in which the underdeveloped third world is underdeveloped .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking everyone &apos;s time and delaying the lunch , but I will only do it once every 10 years , so perhaps you would not keep me tight .
It is a difficult task ; work that requires change things for the better and it is simply not sufficiently experienced .
It was only last year that we agreed to repeal these rules and , if consumers did not see a great deal of difference , our producers did not see it and continue to feel it .
I believe that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are focused solely on austerity and limiting the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) budget to be burdened because that would mean that agriculture probably has less in Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of such an enormous installation leads , according to economic estimates , to a significant direct and indirect cost .
Therefore , I really want to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the compromise proposal negotiated .
President of the Republic of Latvia , a very honourable Member , Valdis Zatlers , it is a great pleasure for us to be able to welcome you today for your first visit to the European Parliament .
The intrigue then became new .
When an agreement is reached with a third country through which illegal immigration could pass and there is a readmission agreement - which is the objective - and therefore the European Union agreements with this third country are strengthened - which falls within the global approach and the philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration - the EU Member States &apos; borders are actually strengthened .
We regret that our suggestion was not included extensively in the report , but we nevertheless welcome the fact that the rapporteur has reached a very close conclusion .
As promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an open world trade environment is one of the tasks presented by President Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I would like to take advantage of the Commissioner for Agriculture &apos;s presence in this House to ask him how he is able to support cooperation with his colleague responsible for concluding the negotiations in the Doha Round .
The report proposes the simplification of financial supervision and control and the strengthening of the technical and scientific assessment through peer review focusing on excellence .
The proposals made here today must be seen , analysed and interpreted from this perspective .
We also need to draw attention to the legal and administrative barriers ( subjectivity , financing rules and sometimes also intellectual property ) that could deter many key actors in research and many SMEs from participating .
I would still like to know whether the Commission will reconsider Directive 2007 / 52 under the aspects it has just listed .
That is why I also voted in favour of provisions that highlight corporate social responsibility .
It should be noted that , compared to the new point we have developed together , that is , the issue of transparency , progress has been relatively slow , in fact , with the new regulations on access to documents , the possibility for people to start infringement proceedings or to request the opening of such procedures , and to discover why these have been closed or opened up , in all cases , been reduced .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my fellow Member , Mr Charles Tannock , I would like to stress that this is not the first time that this House , unfortunately , is still half empty at this moment , is facing the catastrophic human rights situation in Burma .
The task of society is therefore to act in such a way that men and women can decide freely between these two logical options , each one of them has a reason to exist when they are considered from a broader perspective than that of the only work .
It is currently promoting the consumption of products with a reduced nutritional value , leaving behind their sad fate as many thousands of farmers unable to market their production in a country that produces 50 % of its needs .
It is not yet possible to determine all the implications of the current situation on our portfolio and the development of our activities .
In the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law remains of paramount importance and has perhaps never been so important .
Fossil fuels cause centralised , hierarchised and inflexible energy distribution .
On this subject , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , half the mandate of the Hungarian Presidency has passed and it is therefore interesting to take stock of the Presidency to date .
I believe that the review of the first railway package must resolve the problems that the Member States which have received reasoned opinions from the Commission are facing , and must propose a method for resolving them .
Israel is not aware that this large military reaction has shown itself to be potential new potential candidates for suicide attacks , and encourages further Kassam &apos;s fire from the first occasion .
The Burmese authorities preferred to ignore the protests against the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi and the calls for her release from many countries and many organisations , in particular by the Secretary-General of the UN , the Secretary General of ASEAN and several Member States of this organisation , which is after all in Burma .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cuta≈ü , pointed out that , at the end of 2009 , in the European Union budget , the guarantees which supported the EIB &apos;s activities were almost EUR 20 billion , which is enormous for the Union , and therefore it is absolutely right for Parliament to expect an explanation of the risks associated with these guarantees .
Unfortunately , Finland has already given its support to the project , but , on behalf of Timo Soini and myself , I would now like to establish what is information about the project that the citizens of all the countries bordering the Baltic Sea need before the work begins .
Without the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would never have taken shape .
I think it is essential to conduct an information campaign on this subject .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia cannot verify identity documents for Kosovo &apos;s people .
Measures have been taken and clear and precise rules have been adopted in this area as well .
Is they aware of Mr Corbett &apos;s vision , which aspires to the United States of Europe on a Federal fashion , or are they in favour of a freer and free-trade that my party advocates ?
First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Toia , on the quality of the report it presents today .
This is not impunity - impunity would be to continue as it has been for many years now .
It is rare to meet someone who embodies qualities .
I am convinced that not one Slovenian citizen will be opposed to such stress tests being carried out immediately in Kr≈°ko .
It does not augur well that some Member States do not want this Employment Summit on Tuesday .
We have seen that a lot has been done to achieve these benchmarks and we urge the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
Under these circumstances , accepting the Moldovan Government is forcing its people to finance European programmes and agencies that are so cautious that the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the SESAR programme , even though Moldova is not a member of the European Union , is being cynically cynical .
It would be just one stone , as this infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and create new jobs , while mitigating the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Khanty-Mansiysk , we set ourselves a common objective : the conclusion of a strategic agreement that will , in the immediate analysis , serve as a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations and help us exploit the potential of these relations .
It is now clear that we still do not meet the requirements for business in the Mediterranean region and especially in Libya : we need to think a little more about acknowledging that perhaps we will need stronger measures to understand what has happened and also to take concerted action towards the Mediterranean .
Europe &apos;s considerable funding for this line was dependent on supporting the project by local populations and on the existence of funding from Italian private investors .
( SK ) Madam President , last week , reports on the Balkan countries &apos; accession process were published .
That is why we abstained on the vote on the proposals of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on TV1 in Portugal , although the Portuguese Communist Party is known for its critical position with regard to this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed a country-by-country reporting regime so that transnational companies submit their country-by-country statements .
One of the main problems that this report refers to is prostitution and the trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to stand directly with you .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to the end of the mandate , even with the arrest and trial of Messrs Mladiƒá and Hadzic , the Court &apos;s work will not be finished .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support compensation actions against companies responsible for injured farmers who have poisoned their epicals without knowing .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to mobilise information and communications technologies ( ICT ) to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find solutions , we must use the same approach in the future .
However , you know that our message is on structural reforms and it is absolutely essential to undertake structural reforms to increase Europe &apos;s growth and job creation potential .
This partnership is all the more important in the current context of global economic crisis , as it opens up new opportunities for trade , scientific and technological , which would allow us to emerge from the even stronger crisis , with even greater stability .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
The adoption and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon meant an increase in Parliament &apos;s responsibilities , with all that entails in terms of administrative burdens .
Against a backdrop of unprecedented crisis , which kills hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort must be made not to go to 25 million unemployed or poor Europeans by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , again I would like to emphasise the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed with four other Members , and that half of the European Parliament , more than one , has approved , and which aims to undertake the Council and the Commission to make a truly effective piece of legislation on combating corruption .
Mr President , President of the European institutions , my dear President Buzek , my group fully subscribes to your programme for Parliament and Parliament &apos;s conduct over the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let them respect these promises !
We do believe that it is in this kind of dialogue that we can help these countries , especially by strengthening the participation of civil society .
Although , as a socialist , I believe that the guerrille policy under the current conditions in Sri Lanka will not resolve , the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
The time has come for simpler and cheaper rules for SMEs , which will naturally result in greater employment and growth potential .
To combat this phenomenon , it is very important to agree to unify security measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
When we talk about collective action , we always refer to the US system and its experiences and abuses .
The rapid entry into force of the agreements concluded between the European Union and the United States on extradition and legal assistance would give significant impetus to cooperation in the area of criminal law , as well as the elimination of the grey area , which makes it possible for transfers of prisoners .
I have three proposals , and I would like to ask for your high and strong support for them .
The European Court of Justice has already been seized on several occasions , in specific cases , to determine whether a sporting activity is a service that has purely social benefits or , on the contrary , also includes economic aspects by providing a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is of the utmost importance in this institution and that citizens must know that .
Only time will we know whether this is proving to be a marginal problem or whether the unquestionably positive effects of the directive will prevail .
The modernisation of freight transport logistics and the promotion of comodality , i.e. the combination of different modes of transport within the same logistics chain , should enable us to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region .
It should be up to the Member States to decide whether or not in a democratic process they want to ratify this ILO convention .
According to Eurostat in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income varied between EUR 123 and Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that will be adopted in the end will not be so bad .
The Copenhagen Summit was disappointing in more than one respect .
We call on international donors , be they government or not , to interrupt their activities in certain areas if this law is adopted .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights and one aspect that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
V√°clav Havel told us today that Europe is the homeland of our homelands .
So , if I speak to a Hungarian police officer in Slovakia , it is obliged to answer me in Slovak even though his mother tongue is Hungarian , and that independently of the fact that I do not understand his reply .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to pick up on an aspect of transatlantic cooperation relating to the areas of the SWIFT police and justice , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the United States .
In 2009 , we saw an alarming rise in various forms of national protection , both in European Union Member States and in new developing countries .
As for the SWIFT agreement , until now , neither the Commission nor the Council have paid the attention it deserves to transparency .
Finally , politically speaking , it is important for us to have an alliance with the ACP within the WTO .
Something else has to be done .
If we can help to bring together an orphan abandoned and a family that very much wishes to have children , then we will have made a very important contribution .
In particular , I would like to talk about a key factor for the success of the 2020 strategy , namely the absolute necessity for the various EU institutions , of stopping competition and of working together on the basis of which it will not be possible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The tragic events in Gaza also have to force us to adopt a more strategic and long-term attitude to Gaza .
Other indicators need to be drawn up that will help to explain which factors affect a country &apos;s standard of living .

Mr Tajani , Commissioner responsible for industry and entrepreneurship , is committed to examining the losses in this sector .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package includes four draft decisions to implement the Council decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , to a large extent , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be a vote on the European Parliament &apos;s position .
In a turbulent global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union must improve its strategic autonomy in order to maintain its values , defend its interests and protect its citizens , developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats , and aligning its capabilities and resources to respond adequately , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global stability .
It is a good period in relations between the two entities and the results of the current global agreement are positive .
This register will mark a step towards greater transparency of the European institutions , and I hope it will contribute to greater legitimacy for the European project among the citizens .
I suggest that you reread the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
the report by Mr Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
If we are to rise to this challenge , we will have to take decisive and strong political action .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I have told you .
I would like the exclusions to be set out for a clearly unlimited period , either on the basis of precise reference points , whatever structure , and perhaps the Commission could look at the proposals it intends to present in order to meet India &apos;s demands in a way .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , the Prime Minister was accused of all the ills , but nothing has been said of his entrepreneurial activities , which give work to tens of thousands of people .
The opportunity or not of the latter is , of course , an issue that should be considered by Parliament itself .
This report therefore highlights the relevance of an unknown programme while calling for developments : to modify the administrative and financial rules too high and the low level of success that make this programme still too dissuasive for SMEs , while they play an important role in transforming the results of research into products and services , and in ensuring better coordination and between the various players while financing research remains national and sources remains national .
The fact is that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis : it has chosen its camp .
This will not lead to a loss of competitiveness for our businesses .
It called for a global ban on so-called &apos; body scanners &apos; .
Statistical data show that every year , cardiovascular diseases are the cause of around 4.3 million deaths in Europe , and more than 1.7 million people die from cancer .
Vaccines are the least expensive and effective public health tools for preventing infectious diseases in Europe , but it is important for developing countries to be able to benefit from them in order to increase living expectancy and combat poverty .
We must therefore make it clear that the banks are operating new rules in the euro area by the banks to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens is nothing but pure stupidity .
In the current economic situation and here in the European Parliament , it is very important that we keep spending under control .
I therefore believe that greater protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
He has played a very important role as an observer of all trials before the Supreme State Security Court and has carried out regular assessments of the detention conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various EU instruments .
We then believed that each of the new Member States would observe the basic principles of the EU , the prohibition of discrimination , and the protection and promotion of linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
In addition to financial credit , social credit has also contracted .
These new measures would help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights , particularly in the recognition of qualifications , their social and residence rights .
This issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not an isolated issue .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to drawing up , if necessary , a European Union legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
At the same time , men have the right to participate fully in the first few days following the arrival of their children in the family .

The reality is that the European Union must end its absolute dependency on Russia &apos;s energy supplies .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the 111th largest partner of the European Union , and trade relations between the EU and Canada accounted for 1.6 % of the EU &apos;s external trade in 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this into our Rules of Procedure was Mrs Renault , not me .
The country &apos;s fisheries sector is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing four reports in today &apos;s debate , too , and I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work , and the European Commission for its cooperation .
On the summit , I agree that this is an extremely important event .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage that will be applied - and I refer , in particular , to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - uniformly and unbureaucratic throughout the EU without influencing existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama made it clear that the representatives of China could fully study the documents contained in his government &apos;s archives in exile , in order to realise that he did not incite violence .
It was their response to this problem that prevented their development and integration into the international community .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
We are witnessing many demagogic assertions every day that have no professional basis not only in the media but also in the European Parliament .
Since human rights are an essential part of the agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as it will probably have a sensitive impact on the lives of European citizens , as it will have a direct effect on the buildings they hold or use .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position on exemptions - albeit temporary - of the principles on which the European Union is founded , including the four fundamental rights .
However , where we do not agree , it is when it comes to this House taking the grounds for demanding a bigger budget .
Finally , it is time to put an end to this unilateral privilege enjoyed by the United States .
Mr Dalli and the Commission , I would be pleased , now that this directive is in place , if you were to focus more on the social security regulation , which is the system on which everything is based , and which clearly indicates who is paid and where everything is well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common objective and let us work with the Arctic States and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
I think this was very necessary and it was a good example of Parliament &apos;s success in forming the budget , with the use of funds , which , let us say , were not used in other areas .
Now let us look at the assumptions .
To achieve this , we will have to do our utmost to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In sectors as sensitive as clothing , mammoth or mameuting , creating conditions for informed consumer choice is an extremely important issue for these companies that have chosen to maintain production that safeguard know-how and jobs in Europe .
Although attention has been drawn to the problem of violence against women for several decades , the international community has not managed to bring an end to this destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument , contributing to the strengthening of our relations with third countries , with tangible benefits .
Moreover , this is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to give its opinion .
However , with this document , we have abused this obstacle and we have done it because we have to look after patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance and the urgency of these proposals .
I believe that every patient has the right to quality care and care provided to him in his language , close to the place in which he lives , to his family .
In this House , we must use the terms that everyone accepted and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the candidate country , was accepted as the &apos; Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos; and not as a &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This objective is feasible and would generate better results .
The latest developments in the European economy , especially with regard to Greece , have shown that there is an urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
In order not to be left , Stuart Wheiler , who finances this party , said he was costing GBP 120 billion a year , or some 36 times the real amount .
This dual approach to Belarus - the &apos; stick &apos; and carrot &apos; , as Mr Tannock called it , I hope , is the one that will bear fruit .
We could discuss many other issues for hours - energy , non-proliferation , etc . , but I think the most important thing is this fundamental agreement among us , manifested by the three reports presented today , on our recent actions .
Secondly , Mr Rehn said that the Commission should start examining the possibility of issuing Eurobonds - finally , I would like to say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
This is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Enterprises and SMEs
Under this regulation , tyre manufacturers must use labels and coffers to provide users with information on fuel consumption and resilience to wheeled , wet soil grip and external noise levels associated with vehicle increase .
We fully respect the right of the Member States to decide for themselves whether or not to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In view of this , I also think that , in the final phase of the COP 16 negotiations , the European Union should give its main negotiator some scope for manoeuvre in response to the developments arising from the negotiations .
That is why balanced and transparent measures are essential because we need to win the confidence of our entrepreneurs in order to ensure the project &apos;s success .
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of massive urbanisation on the environment , especially in coastal areas and Spanish islands , but also in other areas , for example around Madrid .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia follows the situation very closely , in close cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission .
These processes must include the necessary maintenance and monitoring after the closure ; the treatment , storage and decontamination of waste ; the rehabilitation of the environment of the facilities ; and support for replacing the capacity of dismantled power plants , paying particular attention to the sustainability of the environment and energy efficiency .
That is my conviction .
In my country , whenever I go to a supermarket , I see a man on a backward wall of a backward wooden forest coffer .
So there has been a completely interesting debate on the sale of fertile land by developing countries that do not have arable land ; buying them is in itself a very interesting subject for discussion on which I think we can manage to find common ground .
However , without a trans-European network , these major objectives of the European Union will not be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco grows takes place in 17 of the 27 Member States , with subsidies in any case from their own government .
One of these three languages will be used - English , French or German - to provide legal protection automatically throughout the entire territory of the Union .
It is a very controversial subject in Ireland and it brings water to the mouth of those who are calling for a negative vote on the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency has done its utmost to reach an agreement , but finally decided that this issue should be resolved at the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that we sometimes have differences of opinion .
So that is how this Commission intends to proceed .
However , this can be a one-off event linked to the relying office of the Agency .
The proposed amendments will allow the least developed Member States , such as Romania , to be eligible for this fund .
The next item is voting time .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all sides of Parliament praising the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
I do not need to emphasise the importance of these two points in the current situation .
Together , we will work to ensure that the Doha Round ends with a positive note in 2010 , because that is extremely important for promoting the recovery of the economy and for combating protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , this is a little special day for me , because after 10 years of good and fair services , it was my last presidency of office here in Brussels .
From the point of view of effectiveness , the proposal for these delegations to perform certain consular functions , such as the management of Schengen visas , seems also interesting to me .
We have spent a lot of time discussing with us , rather than discussing others on the day and we have finally fought for birds .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos;s project should be better prepared , which is why Parliament should take more time to decide .
Perhaps there are projects that are going further than we currently see .
Without the European Union and its protective shield , all Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation .
As a Social Democrat , I am pleased that India has made significant progress in universal primary education , poverty reduction and broader access to clean drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso , shaking off the Treaty of Lisbon , said it was the Commission that referred to on behalf of the European Union in environmental matters .
The views can be expressed , we can even disagree , even the Eurosceptics are tolerated , but there is only one possible final result .
Lukashenko , who is a man who was madness , was able to exploit his programme of the countryside and has benefited from political and economic advantages while continuing to show contempt for democracy and human rights .
Still , according to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia , too , hoped to negotiate and conclude agreements on small border traffic between Russia and the Member States of the European Union which would be interested .
This is essential for the future wellbeing of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself have spoken about shortcomings that still need to be filled in the implementation of our legislation in a number of Member States .
We must treat these people freely and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure proper recycling , not only to avoid damaging to the environment and health , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot help but remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still subject to an international arrest warrant , which the authorities of this country are unaware of .
The letter also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of operation of the project , and preparatory work has been initiated .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I expect you to react with a point of order .
With regard to the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , I believe that the proposal as a whole is a good one , as it provides for a ban and a gradual replacement of products with serious effects on human health .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to define the fishing opportunities offered to EU vessels on the basis of available stocks and the financial contribution separately owed for access rights and sectoral support .
Within the European Union , we must lend all assistance to the new Tunisian Government of Unity , as well as to the citizens of the Union , including the British people , who are on holiday in Tunisia and who are left behind .
Ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the proposed regulation because it is right and desirable , in my opinion , to put Taiwan &apos;s island on the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional communication methods do not fulfil their mission due to economic interests or because the directors belong to a given political environment and indirectly force their employees to self-censor themselves .
We cannot coexist in the European Union when this situation continues and , therefore , we think it is very important for the Commission , the authorities of the European Union , and we all presume proposals along the same lines to put an end to this situation .
That is one thing , and I am also going to ensure , as I have committed to any legislation being evaluated beforehand , with regard to a number of social , environmental and economic criteria .

( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is all very well to talk about Belarus here in the European Parliament , but to talk is not enough .
Mr President , I support the proposal and I would like to advocate it .
Secondly , I welcome the fact that East Jerusalem is seen as the capital of the future Palestinian state , or Jerusalem of the two states .

However , there are marked differences , even between regions of the same Member State .
Prevention and the eradication of violence against women are key strategic objectives for achieving the progress our civilisation aspires to .
I look forward to your answers .

I therefore think that the most important question now lies : how can we take advantage of the Swedish Presidency for the future ?
The European Union must see its strengthened role as a result of this crisis .
In this proposal , it is fundamental to emphasise that dialogue is reciprocal and that consideration must be given to and respect for the opinions expressed .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to reinstate Polish street and city names in regions where most residents are of Polish origin .
Since all these actions are linked between them , they are essential and they meet the level of ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious objective as soon as possible to meet the expectations of the citizens .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it represents a clear improvement on the current situation .
In view of these elements , I voted in favour .
The aim of this report is to increase the tolerance threshold against risks , simplify bureaucratic control mechanisms and increase confidence in the scientific community and the world of businesses .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I make my comments from Mr Daul .
The resolution adopted today highlights the fact that the creation of a common register guarantees the widest possible participation of all categories of agents , while respecting their specific features .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask a question to the President of the Commission , who has seen the images received in recent weeks from the Mediterranean showing a large number of people who have fled the situation in Africa and have arrived in Europe , while others have failed in this endeavour .
However , this is not what is happening in Lampedusa , as the situation is sadly evident .
Israel bombs and decides me a ghetto .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is just as important to learn from their experiences .
in writing . - The issue of the CAP and global food security is essential .
I would also like to thank you for a constructive debate on the future .

It accounts for 3 % of the European Union &apos;s GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this regard , we , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , have tabled an amendment which calls - not only for Europe , of course , but also for the United States , as the Commissioner knows - for the complete abolition of all forms of export subsidies , and this immediately .
Most contributors highlight the need to focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture , the capacity to respond to climate change , food security and quality requirements , as well as other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be completed before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Of course , it is extremely important for the European Union to increase the specific subsidies for cities , because this is where the greatest potential for the economy and finance lies , because cities have been hit very hard by the crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will not be officially presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control until next week .
In order to achieve the 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions recommended by scientists and to stop the decline in biodiversity , we need considerable financial resources .
Only the effect of &apos; carrot and stick &apos; , which is the great dynamic of the accession process , can the governments of these countries concentrate on the implementation of the work and reforms that can once and for all consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will concentrate on two reports , given their importance .
In the interests of legal certainty for all those involved , we must give the same rights throughout Europe to those who are accused of crimes , and there must be an obligation to inform about these rights .
Foreign affairs , diplomacy , are national sovereignty and therefore we have voted against all of the reports on this subject .
As far as Mr Weber is concerned , I refer to Article D .
I also appreciated the positive assessment , in the proposal , of the permanent efforts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that the events that took place just a few hours ago in Greece will not work oil , and I hope that they will perhaps mark the beginning of a unanimous effort for the formation of a European identity which is based on solidarity and partnership .
We have been in contact an hour with Tunisia and with the people in Egypt , with our delegations whom I pay tribute for what they have dealt with in recent weeks , and also in direct contact with the government and with services .
In fact , I am convinced that this financial instrument is even more important in the context of the financial crisis , because it can help businesses to do more safely and that it could later serve as a pilot project for the creation of a more generous fund for energy .
These inspections were inadequate .
Europe will then be able to make an important contribution , but it cannot be blamed without substance .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman to Parliament following the draft recommendation by the European Ombudsman to the European Commission in complaint 676 / 2008RT on the Commission &apos;s excessive delay in responding to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
The main advance of this directive in relation to existing legislation is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and have access to information on the quality and safety of care they will receive .
I reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly , and to review the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund , in order to adapt them to the requirements arising from this tragedy .
Having consulted consumer rights organisations and business representatives , I understand that we need to insist even more on the need for greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I said that in this debate anyone dares to ask questions goes wrong .
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor closely the negotiations ( in this case , trade negotiations ) and intervene politically by using the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as the hearings , the resolutions and oral questions , in order to remain informed of the developments in these negotiations .
Null recognition of citizens &apos; investment in social cohesion and solidarity between generations .
However , the real reform is admissibility .
This subject is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union at the moment .
In order to achieve this , adequate financial resources will need to be made available to enable the EU to seize new opportunities and to exploit new sources of competitiveness .
In many countries of Europe , when the public authorities are in a difficult situation , they are known to pay a general delay and very often cause the bankruptcy of certain companies .
The G20 conference also included the decommissioning of tax havens as one of its main objectives .
However , the political class is not of the same interest .
Of course , in international transactions , the &apos; dollar &apos; remains predominated and is always a refuge , but abyssal debts accumulated by the United States to secure their lifestyle by the rest of the world will increasingly have doubts about the capacity of the first economic power to honour its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right measures and instruments to combat and fail those who would like to destroy it .
Even more revealing : Iceland , when it was a rich country , was mocking itself to join the European Union .
This is not a new request , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method of promoting sustainable development , which allows all interested parties to be involved in order to achieve an excellent level of local acceptance .
It is , however , a problem that will export the fight against international terrorism to countries and regions that manage as long as fighting will continue in Afghanistan .
We need to fight fragmentation , and I therefore urge Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund untapped in the regulations and not to divide it as often suggested in this House .
Of course , it is in the nature of things not to achieve everything that is wanted in a compromise .
Finally , I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the rapporteurs L√°szl√≥ Surj√°n , Mr Vladim√≠r Ma≈àka and Mr Jutta Haug , for their constructive attitude during this procedure , sign the very good cooperation that we have achieved .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to recent murders perpetrated against the person of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to emphasise that the duration of negotiations is not unlimited , which would open the way for other more realistic solutions , such as preferential partnership .
Therefore , it is , first and foremost , a US problem that Washington must resolve .
Let me also say that we should implement a reform that makes European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers , creating dynamic knowledge society development .
The quota they buy can remain in the national reserve and be distributed at a later stage if the Member States so wish .
I call once again for 25 May , on the day of its execution , to become International Day of Heroros of the Fight against Totalitarianism , because many anonymes , such as Pilecki , lost their lives by fighting for rights and fundamental freedoms , to be remembered .
Let me briefly mention what we have done .
If such a position were to become a majority in the European Union for the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the peace plan financed at great costs and established after the wars in the Balkans .
I hope that these changes will encourage citizens to participate in EMAS , not because I want to act on the figures and see EMSO compete , but because I believe that this system is good and could help us meet our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker answered a blue-card question from Christian Dan Preda under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As several speakers have pointed out , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I believe it will happen well .
Monetary dumping and its consequences in social terms can no longer be admitted .
This aspect is crucial to ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .

I am very aware , Mr Kelly , of the complexity of this subject .
Although most countries are facing economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to combating the harmful effects of climate change .

Thus , the global eligibility of these measures has increased .

In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
What the citizens are interested is solutions , and that their money is always safe .

I also share the view of many Members here that the more Europe will be united , the better the EU-Russia relations will be good .
Syria still has a long way to go with regard to freedom of expression and association .
Much remains to be done to ensure that women have fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal needs to be reviewed in order to take account of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are perfectly aware that the situation of dairy producers is unbearable .
I supported this report because I wanted , among other things , to emphasise a danger referred to in the text : the lack of information for consumers based and detailed on the properties of health , composition and origin of particular species of fish .
After all , the history of a thousand examples of intervention from the Western countries that have made it more difficult than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is absolutely ineffective and , for a number of reasons , it does not allow the prevention of crime to be addressed .
This Palestinian understanding is a first-class political fact and , unlike what was said here just now , Hamas admitted , for the first time , to PLO and the Palestinian Authority as negotiating partners .
Countries are slowing up and negotiating to distribute seabed .
The latter is particularly important , especially in view of the energy infrastructure problems that ...
In other words , it was precisely the institution that was set up to protect us from criminals ( indirectly , by providing professional training to police officers ) who are on the bank of defendants .
However , the transfer of power from Fidel Castro to his brother , Ra√∫l , has not led to democratic reforms or the release of political prisoners .
The energy performance of products will also be recorded on all advertisements containing information on energy consumption or on the cost of the product .
Ladies and gentlemen , all of you know about the Washington Consensus , you adordered !
In this way , we could also respond adequately to the current reality on the ground , which Frontex is already facing .
I would like to conclude by once again thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees participating , for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this issue , and I am very grateful to the Presidency for its support in finding a viable solution .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the private economic fabric makes the candidate particularly able to ensure the balance between Community law and the specific requirements of both market and citizens of Europe .
So far , the conflict has left 1 000 victims in 17 days .
The number of falsified medicines can only be reduced and their use will only be safe if such measures are taken .
We must also learn from the Opel case : it is not too late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automotive sector .
We did this because , like you , President Obama and I reject the false choice between security and ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro proposes to preserve wage austerity .
A new trial started at Manchester airport and , according to the legal advice received , the use of these machines on minors could infringe the safety and protection of children given the nature of the image produced .
In addition , this money is not directly paid to artists .

I am voting in favour of the report on the establishment of a new microfinance facility which will help people who are at risk of setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that we have made some progress along these lines with Mr Vlas√°k &apos;s report , with which I fully agree , and I believe that this report will enable us to define better the legal framework for urban issues , but also to put in place tools such as municipal operational programmes , which will give new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , it was clear to me that the improvements I proposed on behalf of Parliament were essential to secure energy markets placed on the basis of fairness and efficiency .
In the current economic crisis , it is vitally important for self-employed workers to be supported and encouraged .
In short , there is no need to ask Brussels for them .
Mr President , for us , for Europe , for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for the citizens of Europe , it is clear that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , a factor that can be brought about conflict and that is exactly what we are concerned about .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report because the food programme that it envisages extension is an essential instrument of support for the poorest people who have been hard hit by the economic crisis and who are even finding it difficult to meet their vital needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least one export credit agency with public support and , together , these agencies represent , globally , the largest source of public funding for private sector projects .
That is why we do not support this report .
In this way , we have contributed to the destruction of this common government .
By creating in 2003 the French Federal Incult Council , Mr Sarkozy , then Interior Minister , introduced Islam into the French institutions .
In this regard , I have already asked the European Commission to give an opinion and to consider the possibility of drawing up specific programmes to create opportunities for women in the scientific sector .

The border between freedom and security does not end up at the virtual world &apos;s borders .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , as from this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the strategy in order to allow for a development in key areas such as promoting civil education , professional orientation and employment .
The costs will be borne by the country of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of the measures we can take to establish a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to open up dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the region .
We can therefore expect a nuclear reactor accident every 25 years .
In my opinion , this greater eligibility of housing for expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF must give us consideration to other possible developments , in the medium and long term , whether in terms of fund eligibility or in terms of curbing certain strategic priorities .
Now is the time to talk again about the violation of religious rights in these two countries , this time in the case of Christians .
Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing our planet .
Of course , as I expected , many speeches have focused on human rights and the need to ensure that this aspect is clearly incorporated into all the dynamic relations we have and in all our work .
I would also like to say that , to date , the European Union has no jurisdiction over the regulation of air traffic .
However , Europe is not a bail-out or a remedy for an ongoing crisis .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment the Commission has already made to comitology and voluntary provisions .
I do not think that the empty words made here today , even those spoken by the Commission , can change the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya and that , at the moment , it is not even capable of bringing an end to the crisis in the cities or to the actions of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s troops .
That is why I firmly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , they will , to a large extent , benefit the citizens of Europe because they will then have the opportunity to make a much greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I hope that steps will be taken at the European Council to reassure the markets and bring about stability in the euro area , because whether we are a member or not , we all have an interest in it .
The funding of pre-accession aid has shown itself to be particularly conducive to fraud .
This event gives rise to a situation of enormous thanks and joy .
We therefore call on all parties to end this war and violence and urge the EU to act accordingly .
The world outside Europe is tackling the energy challenge head on .
The indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in advertisements for sale or rental travel in the media .
Efforts to increase Community investments must be encouraged to promote the diversification of cross-border structures , to encourage research of alternative and non-conventional energy sources at local level and to improve infrastructure capacity in order to facilitate links with new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which must lead to the growth of internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we need to consider the creation of a rapid reaction instrument within the ENP in order to provide a swift and flexible response to political changes in partner countries , as happened recently in the southern neighbourhood .
I believe that the condemnation of the EULEX mission by an MEP in favour of the Serbs is quite simply grotesque .
As a result , the only Members listening to you are those who can do so in the language of origin .
We have lost a great deal of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the Swedish Presidency &apos;s emphasis on issues that affect our citizens , our voters , in this case the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , employment protection and the fight against crime , because , in order to do a good job , we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us .
The Union budget cannot , as certain Members support , be used as a supplement to national budgets in a period of austerity ; it should instead reflect the difficult situation in which the EU Member States themselves find themselves .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty does not give the Council any jurisdiction to the national constitutions of the Member States .
These are not common affairs .
You will probably find me cynical , but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always travel for a limited period .
Will the global financial crisis , which has degenerated into an economic crisis , cause the current situation , or are we facing the mistakes , carelessness and lack of action that we are responsible for ?
My second but &apos; but &apos; concerns the role played by the Belgian Presidency during the period after Lisbon .
The main objective of these schemes was and is to unite the territory of this huge state , which has completely different categories of people .
( PL ) Even though many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we still have to combat its adverse consequences .
This is almost the case in many areas with Japan , but I recognise Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect the rizbeekeepers market , to give its producers a higher price at global level and not want massive imports that would completely destroy its landscape , just like I recognise our economies the right to protect certain sectors of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to talk about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
Only 15 % of elderly people , for example , use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy for strengthening social priority , as I said to you when we discussed the broader political guidelines for the next term .
Commissioner , I will therefore go straight to the goal by asking you what measures - and I am talking about the plural - the Commission intends to take in the short term to address these shortcomings .
This is precisely what has been lacking so far or has not been sufficiently shown to our citizens .
It does not matter to citizens , and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 0 : 10 )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal by approving by a very large majority the report by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank , and the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania supports the open doors policy , in particular , to strengthen relations between NATO and Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that all this needs to be done to avoid the consequences of the disaster and to rebuild living conditions .
I also clearly refer to accidents at work , which happen quite frequently , but also to hazardous substances used in the work process .
In September 2009 , the Council started the detailed examination of the proposal to adapt the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund .
At the moment , it is important to pay particular attention to the island and to the outermost regions which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , are today facing the destruction of the infrastructure and personal , commercial and agricultural goods , and in many cases , could not be allowed to resume normal activities immediately , especially in regions that depend exclusively on tourism , because the media have been visiting possible events in a discouraging manner .
We have not seen such disruption to industry so strongly , with such huge financial losses since 11 September and , despite the financial difficulties currently being faced by all Member States , I would like to urge them to support an industry that simply cannot accept additional losses .
At the same time , we must recognise that our exposure to risks also increases .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I have a brief remark about language , if not perhaps even semantic , .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you can want something very strong about it - but you have to see the realities .
For the judicial project of collective redress in Member States , consumer organisations are calling for an elaboration of binding measures and other options , such as extending alternative conflict settlement mechanisms ( ADR ) already in place for collective redress .
Turkish Cypriots are not the problem , as some claim .
I would like to ask the Commission what measures are being taken to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their country of origin , avoiding long and devastating journeys to consumer countries .
That is our duty .
And I really wonder , ladies and gentlemen , where the human rights defenders , who welcome the West , like us , to be secular and pluralist and who shamefully drop the eyes before an Middle East that slowly becomes the sole religion .
We are doing this and we are engaged with the authorities of these countries .
( FR ) Mr President , bankers who destroy our money deserve our contempt , but Mr Schulz , politicians who are accumulating deficits and debts on the back of future generations are just as irresponsible .
I would like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs of the various groups for this .
We believe that it is now the turn of the Member States to speak .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been good ; the relationship has been very cooperative , in fact , very cooperative .
We should strive to ensure that the proposed programmes support as much as possible for the reforms undertaken in these countries to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important for each Member State to maintain national contact points in order to provide patients with all the necessary information , namely , with regard to the availability of healthcare , procedures and the documentation required .
Previously , we felt all events in the Soviet Union to be ideological pressure , while we are now talking about trade under absolute conditions of individual freedom .
Apart from the fact that this fund is public or private , this report is about a very specific point , Parliament states that it does not have the right to subsidise its deficits , and secondly that such a deficit will never be subject to a grant .
Their face is certainly the most expensive since the Three H√©lene H√©l√®ne who launched a thousand boats .
Aid which leads to distortion competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences both for employment and for technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that we should bear a few things in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard several Members say that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact , with an reverse ballot mechanism .
Having said all this , I think it is very important to go back over the substance of the situation .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
In order to show our solidarity with the campaign aimed at bringing an end to this barbaric ritual ritual , I would like to encourage all of you and everyone to stand up with a rose in order to symbolise our opposition to this practice .
Democratic control is being pushed into the background as national governments are refugees behind the Commission and the troika on the most elementary measures , while the Commission is passing on these matters to national governments .
Investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After having been threatened with legal proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union by the Commission , Sweden has now begun to authorise decaD .
It is obvious to those of us who have been elected in rural constituencies , and for those who sit in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the situation in which many livestock farmers find themselves is quite simply unsustainable .
Savings deserve transparent , easy to understand and available information .
I think it could be up to us to support the Chinese people in their achievement of a harmonious society .
In the vote , I supported these two mechanisms because I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to improve European budgetary stability and thereby protect our future .
It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - a social organisation or not a government - clearly and explicitly specifies the subject and objective of the initiative , even though not necessarily a legislative proposal should be submitted .
There is a city in Latvia , Daugavpils , where more than 90 % of the population is Russian-speaking .
I would like here to praise the apologies of the Prime Minister , Mr Jan Fischer , and the recent motion for a resolution of the Czech Government requiring the Minister to undertake by 31 December 2009 a series of measures to stop the violations in question .
I am in favour of the report , because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
Today , the effects of globalisation have been totally overwhelmed by the economic and financial crisis and our measurable reaction is the adjustment of the EDF financing criteria .
This resolution takes note of Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 , recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to intensify their common approach to Kosovo for its accession to the European Union .
Compared to the other two institutions , the European Parliament continues to show the way for transparency , and so I would not make it my first priority , as we are far more open than any national assembly on accessibility of documents than on the transparency of MEPs &apos; meetings and activities .
Italy was wrong to react as it did for reasons of internal politics through the Italian Minister for Reform , Umberto Bossi .
The warnings issued by the Asturias Human Rights Observatory , my region , and by many other organisations , deserve our full attention .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I deeply regret the adoption of this resolution on the rejection of thrombin pork or bovine .
I have therefore chosen to abstain on this text and to follow the ongoing investigation carefully .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data is not entirely appropriate either when it comes to determining the measures to be implemented to disciplise Member States with the highest level of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
More importantly , increasing the energy efficiency of buildings is the best way to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors where the ETS does not apply .
With regard to the second question , I can assure Members that the Commission knows full well that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance requires a multidisciplinary approach .
The trialogue held yesterday allows us to hope for a final agreement on this point .
Projections for the future , based on an annual growth rate of around 27 % over the next few years , indicate that this figure will rise to EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that the text changes the form of a regulation and not of a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what ACTA is and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report as financial support by the EU will help people affected by globalisation find work , return to the labour market and , in so doing , escape the state of the recession .
Since the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and the development and knowledge of citizens from a cultural perspective , in particular through the distribution of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and the creation of software and innovation .
All of this is in addition to the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and the problems that a country which shares borders with more than 80 million people will entail , which I believe should not be a member of a Europe whose unity depends , above all , on Christian spirit , on .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the House )
It is contrary to the interests of the environment and the consumer , since old appliances that use a great deal and are potentially dangerous are placed on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to further debates .
I would like to express my thanks to the bourgtre of Balingen , Mr Reitemann , and his municipal council for allowing this monument to be recorded in honour these young men &apos;s sacrifice .
Thirdly , I would ask Mrs Kroes for an immense favour , namely to speed up digitisation in the Member States , so that we can be proud of this extraordinary flagship project in the future .
Anyone who lived and has seen the results of the environmental disaster resulting from the failure of the technology in Baia Mare , and the subsequent spraft of cyanide mining in water prices , with large-scale effects on fauna in the River Tisza in Hungary and in the Danube , would do their utmost to prevent such an event from occurring in the EU .
It is the responsibility of everyone : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries over EUR 100 billion a year .
Then there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and return their property : as you said , it is about the fundamental freedom to move and transform the dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the Commission &apos;s proposal should be rejected .
What is important is that we have had the courage to convene this summit , that we have invited the social partners to participate in it and that we are preparing it with them in the long term - before the employment summit , there will be three rounds in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we are trying to reach conclusions that will be of benefit to the June Council .
