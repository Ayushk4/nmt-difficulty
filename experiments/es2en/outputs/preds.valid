Closure of sitting
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.

President of the Commission. - Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone when it comes to the global response to the crisis.
The conclusions of the report being discussed on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight that importing agricultural products from third countries have a much more harmful impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making climate change much better.
It is, in fact, difficult to accept that the countries to which these funds are given can no longer be used.
Dates for next sittings: see Minutes
The maritime institutions of the Member States must cooperate much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes, as well as offer opportunities for remunerated practices and exchange experiences with European maritime companies.
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe.
What we do notice is that our farmers are asking us for more and more.
Frontex must be strengthened and the EU must also force the authorities in the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities.
I would like to add one point that no one, except Commissioner Almunia, has so far addressed.
Areas which are susceptible to the effects of climate change are essentially the following: water resources, agriculture, energy, forestry and biodiversity and, last but not least, the population's health.
Let me also express my regret at the death of nine Turkish soldiers and at one stage of the terrorist attacks last week.
Mr Piebalgs, congratulations on everything that you are doing.
However, it is comforting that the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments, which I supported, and which would initially increase the planned appropriations (for example, in the case of Article 15 02 relating to the lifelong learning programmes) following the opposition and the concerns expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education as regards the degradation of education and training policies), particularly at the time of the European Union, which is leading to many problems and particularly many Member States.
A minority government was then seized with completely different political guidance without anyone considering that as a coup d'état.
The fact that we, the international community, have limited ourselves to considering how the problem of Abyei remained unresolved in the referendum is truly irresponsible and a prescription perfect for a restart to war in the future.
The case of the Romanian balance players in Romania Marian Cozma, who was brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community, shows us once again that the crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community are counterproductive.
You have a sensible European food policy.
The Treaty of Lisbon can represent a new political model in Europe, both in terms of the need to pool Member States' funds to achieve optimal results, and to work on shared strategies and operations that will make Europe in the political Union, which had been dreaming of many years ago.
That is what we are calling for.
We all support, like Hungary at the outset, the Single Market.
Climate change is inevitably forcing society and the economy of the European Union to make a new reality.
Countries will continue to promote domestic stability and will contribute to finding social solutions - economic and solutions to ethnic tensions.
Three years of Roma have been brilliant and, like all merger ambassors, I am pleased to see that it has come to an end.
The need for NATO to remain vigilant and to receive support, particularly at this time in Afghanistan, is imperative.
However, something will have to happen and we need to do something to make it happen.
In this respect, common aspects, such as reduced VAT rates, programme exceptions, the option to set a maximum rate and, last but not least, the place of taxation of intra-EU supplies, will have to be addressed.
Let me tell you something about the West Mistlands: we have the highest rate of youth unemployment and our main industry has been decimated, partly due to the financing of jobs carried out by the European Union in Slovakia, which led to the disappearance of fundamental jobs at the Ryton plant.
It is essential to ensure that these offshore institutions are not intimidated to weaken or undermine fundamental rules that reform the financial sector.
Enough is enough!
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of research centres that can share specialised infrastructure and exchange useful information and data.
Qimonda fulfils the Lisbon Strategy objectives.
in writing. - Mr President, I welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office, given the deterioration in the situation in third countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East.
Mr Severin has clearly defined strategic reciprocity by saying that Europe needs a strong United States and that the United States needs a strong Europe.
I would therefore like to ask the Council whether it can tell us what this movement of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion could be included in the resettlement programme.
I firmly believe that, in the near future, the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to abolish visas.
Finally, it was not a food inspector or an EU food safety agency that made the discovery, but the company itself.
Belarus (debate)
We must therefore use our perspective of military capabilities by emphasising flexible power and prevention to tackle a new agenda, one that has already existed, but which was made clear in Munich, so that President Obama's policies allow us to enter a new age of disarmament negotiations.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Lisbon Treaty, which has been prepared for some time in the Committee on Budgets.
In September, the members of the Mom Dem (Democratic Movement) did not vote in favour of the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission, as his path was not appropriate to recommend his re-election.
By restructuring our agricultural policy, we can be sure that attention is focused on animal welfare, that animals live in suitable conditions for their species and that animals are strong and robust, depending on the principle that says that prevention is better than cure.
We fear that, if the scope of this regulation is expanded, it is the same fate as the last attempt to introduce the'made in' origin marking, in other words, that the Council will be able to block it again.
(SL) Mr President, I would like to join the other speakers in asking politicians, the Member States and the European Union to put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts in favour of economic recovery.
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the US, both with deficits of more than 10%, will have to be subject to significant adjustment in order to restore the sustainability of their public finances.
We should keep the issues separate or not Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary and I do not think that this is his responsibility.
Clearly, there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China.
- Report: Jean-Marie Cavada
In addition to the insult to wine producers who follow a quality policy, particularly in Provenza, it would be unacceptable to give legitimacy to a by-product resulting from blending finished products, and to allow confuse references to their rosé colour.
Much more needs to be done, however.
What will happen is that jobs will be lost in rural Europe and there will be a reduction in our food production capacity.
Let us also remember that despite these institutional issues, this Swedish Presidency - this very rule - has been very conditional on the need to make progress on the issue of climate change, the need to make progress on the financial crisis, the concern that we in Europe need a policy for job creation, so a great many important issues need to be addressed.
Let me stress, however, that we are well aware that it will need to provide a new basis for judicial and police cooperation and thus allow Parliament to act as colegislator.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for leaving the ethical dimension which naturally falls within the powers of the Member States.
This is right, since it is ultimately young people who are going to decide the future of Europe, but on the other hand we must remember those who have already made a very significant contribution to building our continent.
In other words, we are drafting an economic recovery plan in which we provide the energy giants with 3.5 billion oligarchy and not one euro to the partners whose help us achieve the change to green energy.
Fishing quotas and the management of stocks are indispensable to preventing a complete overfishing stock of internal and oceans' fishing resources.
We would have preferred to have seen a rise in the European Parliament's resources thanks to redistributions and measures aimed at improving efficiency rather than increasing the total budget.
Furthermore, this package could show how the European institutions can cooperate in a responsible, efficient and constructive way in such an important area.
I believe that a'frontloading' (initial and sustained effort), as advocated by the Commission in its proposal for a recast, in other words, to improve first-instance procedures, will enable us to create real economies in the medium term.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have produced a good report and achieved a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading.
We do not want to export European jobs to countries that do not have a level of environmental protection equivalent to our own.
All the contributions were useful.
(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly getting worse.
They need to make a great deal of effort to achieve an understanding among the 27 Member States, reflecting Europe's unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration.
Madam President, I rise as the Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report.
Tourism is, of course, one of the economic sectors with greater potential for development.
At the time, the money was intended for only two types of projects, the aim of which is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, in other words capture and storage of carbon (CCS) and wind plants in the North Sea.
If there was a proposal to allocate money from the EGF to redundant workers in Britain, we would vote in favour of that allocation and would criticise us if we did not.
As regards the Court's activities, we know that the Court is fully operational, but it is still in nappies.
It affects our neighbours and encompasses our closest neighbours, such as Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, and others further away than Armenia, Azerbeidjan and Georgia.
I am very dedicated, together with my colleagues in the Commission, to integrating the principle of gender mainstreaming into all the policies that we are going to put forward.
These projects will help to eliminate the differences in the connections between the systems in the European Union, and enable the energy sources with which the European Union counts to be used to a more optimal extent.
Furthermore, this approach is based on policies and I believe that Europe, more than anything else, needs more policies, which is undoubtedly also one of the responsibilities of this Parliament.
There is also the issue of FIFA's failure to introduce target online technology, which other sports have already managed.
After all, we can organise various types of training or workshops activities, during which we can truly help access EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas.
There are other parliamentarians who use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral dealings with suppliers who often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity.
Furthermore, I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in creating a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the field of legislative programming.
Numerous Member States have made considerable efforts to meet the commitments made under that Pact.
The aim is to allow the EU to obtain responses to the major social challenges affecting the whole of the Member States and those that cannot respond to themselves (democratic ageing and health, energy supply, water or food, sustainable development, the fight against climate change, etc.), as well as developing the knowledge that our companies allow us to continue to innovate and increase their competitiveness.
Although we will vote in favour of the resolution tomorrow, I believe that this budget has some inconsistencies and I would like to highlight the two things that I consider to be central.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his excellent work.
We will be taking the lead in governance for the world economy, specifically with regard to financial regulation and the timely monitoring of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.
However, I would like us to look into this in a little more detail.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was set up to provide additional support to workers made redundant who suffer the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to help them reintegrate into the labour market.
The issue of substance lies in the decision by Europeans not to accept the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would necessarily result from accession.
This is a difficult and ingrained role.
This is among the top priorities of our list.
However, EU support is fundamental to ensuring the country's independence.
The Israeli Government continues to colonise forced marches after committing war crimes at the beginning of this year.
The additional assessments and visits of expert teams have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area.
Adjournment of the session
Portugal is maintaining the five long-liners it had before.
an increase in budgets for these areas and the creation of new military capabilities that will contribute to a new arms race;
I would also like to stress the contradiction between the commitment made by the Pakistani Government to religious freedom and its important role in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to approve its programme of'Combating the defamation of religion' in the United Nations.
That is my honest view, and that is why I express this evening.
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good compromise because it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment.
In these circumstances, rapid, coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is imperative, with measures such as a reduction in the price of purchasing new cars for returning old ones, financial assistance and so on.
In my opinion, the legal basis proposed is correct, but it seems inconsistent with the most appreciable entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, at a time when the unification of the roles and competences that are now repaired between the two pillars will take place.
Madam President, success or failure, that is the issue.
Such a policy is doomed to failure if seafarers from seafarers to traders who sell fish to consumers do not comply with the rules.
... this useless and expensive forum of sniping that we have in Parliament, which is hidden, with the sophisticated part of responsible democracy, monstrous fraud to the constituents who have sent us here.
It is a pity, because we are supposed to be united on this issue.
We no longer say that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy 100% of our industries in Europe, because somehow we are not concerned because the climate has to be the priority.
The burden of debt - the painful proof of which we are witnessing - stands in the way of economic growth, not only in European countries, but also in the United States.
Furthermore, this report will help to simplify the various aviation agreements and to make them simpler and it maintains the criteria for which we must pay attention and the aspects to which we must monitor.
I will vote in favour of the telecoms package, but I will vote in favour of it with some reluctance, because I believe that the highest level has betrayed the fundamental principle of the liberalisation of telecommunications that it is supposed to achieve this directive.
(PT) Madam President, President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are experiencing an unprecedented crisis.
Its impact will be greater and their cost to the smaller taxpayer if we are able to coordinate efforts.
The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for Belarusians to obtain European visas and a readmission agreement.
Let me give a specific example.
Let us take, for example, the education of children in schools.
We also do not know whether the rules that we promote for the legal trade in timber will come into force and be implemented globally, and whether some speakers have already emphasised this problem.
in writing. - (PT) It is crucial to set up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body for analysing and evaluating the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to promote quality and sustainable growth.
in writing. - I voted in favour of changing the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to enable the use of more effective vaccines and reducing bureaucracy for farmers.
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for strong, integrated EU policies.
With my vote, I wanted to express my deepest disappointment at the outcome of the conference, well below the expectations of the citizens.
Delays in payments often cause difficulties in both the internal market and cross-border trade.
It is clear that we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour, no one denies them, but we must not insist that the citizens make every effort, as they are our only chance of emerging stronger from this crisis.
In the United States, they have a rapid early warning system to that end.
We found such a case in one of my own voters, Mr Andrew Symeou.
Together, we must defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy.
Moving down things: that is what the Europeans asked for when choosing this Parliament, and that is what we need to do if, in five years' time, we are going to have more of those who are voting on.
The parts of the text for which the European Council is competent and it was the European Council itself that agreed.
Expenses in private end consumption per capita increased by more than 80% in the last decade.
At this stage, I think it would be useful to reflect effectively on the most appropriate way to implement the current legislation.
The results of the summit in this regard are very vague.
To this end, the proposal provides uniform instruments allowing compliance or precautionary measures to prevent problems of recognition and translation of instruments emanating from other Member States, and a form of standardised reporting of documents associated with complaints on the territory of another Member State.
I support the proposals for the 2011 budget because it takes into account the important policies and all opinions.
The Commission can support the Member States through financial programmes to cooperate at European level.
Thus, for example, the decisions made on 13 June 2002 or 8 May 2003 by the Council set up an operational so that the Member States would cooperate at an intergovernmental national level for the persecution of these crimes, which, in some States, thankfully - and we all remember for example, the Pinochnal case - are even part of their legislation.
Thank you.
My vote should not be seen as support for the EU subsidy chollo either.
More and more, we make our purchases at a distance: the Internet has changed all our habits completely, partly because our lives are increasingly curb.
As far as information is concerned, we are continually providing information as we receive it.
Finally, I would like to say that better investment is investment in the education of young generations, and I mean lifelong learning.
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere.
I am pleased that these problems have been found in the discussions with the Council and that this is reflected in the final text.
(Applause from the centre left)
In this case, there are hundreds of people involved, often with small children and without appropriate funds.
Procedures are completely different in terms of appealing to the Commission under the provisions of the future Treaty, and of appealing to Parliament through the petitions procedure.
Human rights must be respected by all sides in the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has created doubts about our ability to maintain the stability of our euro area.
We all need to face up to our responsibilities.
We understand that the UNESCO has, in any case, presented formal protests to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of urbanisation on Kashgar's heritage and traditional culture.
in writing. - Mr Schwab has proposed a report aimed at increasing car safety by implementing more safety requirements for car manufacturers.
I therefore voted against this report.
The economic and financial crisis caused us a heavy blow, but we have demonstrated our ability to act and have strengthened our resistance.
If we are talking about Parliament's position with regard to external bodies, for example, the human rights organisations, which could be affected by this, and if we are not able to reach an agreement, although I hope that this is not the case, and if the various projects cannot take place, then I think that there is support and understanding of Parliament's position.
This House's plenary sessions on Thursday afternoon are taking an increasingly surreal colour, both from the point of view of the gap we see and the issues of treaties and the way in which they are handled.
I think we are still in no way sure that Moldova will get its president to choose and, if that does not happen, the country will obviously have new elections next year.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999, and 11 Member States adopted the single currency at the same time.
(EL) Madam President, I too endorse and welcome this compromise, because it questions the democratic deficit that women in particular have had to face for years when they help their self-employed wives in trade, craft, small and medium-sized enterprises and liberal professions, without any recognition of their working years.
Our political elections are, of course, different and they are often facing each other.
I would call climate justice because this is the relationship between developing countries and developed countries, the willingness to put forward a credible proposal for financing mitigation and adaptation measures, and the way in which we also show our willingness to lead the cause.
Consequently, I would also like to know what the Commission's position on this issue is.
I would like to remind you of the State aid granted to the banks, which benefited from it, and yet did not adopt the relevant social approach.
I have not only three children, but I also have a grandchildren at this stage who are drinking milk.
We are prepared to organise technical assistance programmes that accompany the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities have to implement.
We are waiting for this to be produced by the Commission.
As you say, we must update our statistics all the time and Eurostat is working on this.
Sometimes, I wonder whether we have not learnt enough about the consequences of our actions, whether we are not looking for European solutions to European problems and trying to find something concrete even if we have to deal with it collectively.
Electronic mails also reveal that scientists who have been sceptical about this hypothesis have been removed from the peer review processes to prevent research from being subjected to public scrutiny.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate.
Perhaps the Internet has shown a light in the midst of this straitous part of our society that we are still facing and facing a great deal of evil.
We know what kind of people we are dealing with in this matter, and that is why the institutions need to be aware, in terms of inspections, of the fact that they pose a very important risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections.
Our priority during the work on reviewing the RoHS Directive was to raise the safety parameters for electrical equipment to sell in the European Union.
Preventive work is taking place in schools mainly because it is the most vulnerable social group to drug trafficking.
It was expanded successfully to bring the continent together after the Cold War, and it is now called upon to preserve previous achievements and to continue integration when better times occur.
There are many Members who want answers tonight and out of respect for them, we would like to carry this out in an orderly manner.
But those of us who have been involved here know that there was no alternative, and fortunately we are now on the way to solving some of the problems experienced by much of this sector.
Secondly, while the ECR Group fully agrees with the need for maternity and paternity provisions, we chose to abstain on the inclusion of such references in the report because we oppose family policy being dictated at EU level; it is national governments that should decide on this.
The latter thing, and not least, therefore, is that I believe that the forthcoming discussions on this subject must be addressed by the European Union Border Assistance Mission for Rafah (MAFEU Rafah): how this mission could be restored and how it could be extended.
The Commission is therefore monitoring the situation and, if necessary, the Commission will act, but I believe that we should not go beyond the existing structures in Community law and the Commission will definitely remain within Community law.
Since our approach is to see a genuine European diplomatic service, which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and the Personal Regulation, which we are going to vote on today and tomorrow, are of the utmost importance.
in writing. - In view of the persistent gap between men and women in employment, wages and access to managerial positions, I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC and to take steps to ensure that its provisions are fully transposed into their national legislation.
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
What I want, and I hope to achieve, is that the Commissioner recognises that there will be no further progress for now, in the coming weeks, except in the case of the submission of the two fugitives to be given to the Court.
We will be raising this issue soon, with discussions on restructuring the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport.
The European Parliament has adopted today, Wednesday 20 October, the report by the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis.
Greater taxes are already being talked about in the near future to keep public finances afloat.
It is time we expressed our demands that both Christians and believers in other religions be able to practise their religion in freedom.
Throughout the EU, 31.5% of women work part-time (30 hours or less a week), compared with only 8.3% of men.
I share the caution of the Commission and the Minister and think that, while the horizon is slipping away, there are still many clouds.
At that time, we had few imagination of the scale of the economic crisis that was eaggering.
For this reason, Parliament is moving in the right direction and shows that this side of the consumer.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this brilliant report.
This policy has become a key feature of the economic recovery package, providing added value and supporting efforts to promote sustainable economic growth and modernisation, thus demonstrating European solidarity at the same time.
Moreover, unfortunately, we do not yet know whether the Treaty of Lisbon is coming into force and when, of course, it is necessary to apply without hesitation the current Treaty.
However, I believe that the situation clearly shows the despair of the agricultural industry, of course in my region, if farmers have to wait for days on the streets, in the winter months, in an attempt to secure a modest sum of EU funding.
The southern Member States have left it too late.
It must be done through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy.
We will express our will on behalf of the citizens in a democratic vote, so tomorrow will be a very important day.
It should be said that providing a home is an absolute necessity for everyone, especially in the modern welfare state.
In my opinion, defining the political priorities means that they must be scrutinised, which must be transparent and also democratic.
This particular project deals with the deployment of a traffic management system.
(HU) In recent months, a climate of fear in Vojvodina, in the north of Serbia, has once again prevailed between the various nationalities that live there, mainly Hungarians.
What we are going to vote on is the result of a compromise solution - sometimes difficult - and I am aware that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have succeeded, on our behalf, in achieving a viable and workable outcome.
in writing. - While we agree with those parts of the proposal that ensure equal treatment between Parliament and the Council with regard to access to meetings and information; regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and President of Parliament; cooperation on citizens' initiatives; and the use of'soft law'; do we agree with the application of punitive law; do not agree with the directives?
Everyone knows that there is no broadcasting without access to radio spectrum, and EU policy must ensure that all market actors have access to that spectrum without any discrimination whatsoever.
That will provide us with a general and quite comprehensive framework for action by the Commission on equality between men and women in the areas my fellow Member has just mentioned, from employment to the other ways in which it is important to ensure and guarantee this type of equality.
We hope that the other heavy nightmare of politics and the economy will also make their offers, which several of them have so far not done.
Dementia and Alzheimer's disease, in particular, are not only serious medical problems, but they are also an extremely sensitive ethical and social problem, the seriousness of which will continue to increase in relation to the ageing of Europe's population.
I would also like to point out that you have been very careful to point out that we must not confuse different responsibilities and, of course, do not want to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union either.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs, who have dealt with the details of this matter: Mr Szájer and Mr Duff, and Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl.
We have given you our power and, with all the support of the European institutions, I would ask Minsk to accept our help because you and the citizens of Belarus have a lot to gain.
We need to follow what is happening very closely, because the President said that we would achieve annual savings of EUR 38 billion from European companies.
Now, after the ruling against Liu Xiaobo, we see even how the police have banned a homosexual file, which clearly threatens to become an age of political ice for dissidents, human rights defenders and Chinese homosexuals.
(SL) Commissioner, the report you have presented today on Ukraine was quite clear.
We must recognise that this will only happen with the involvement of parliaments, as only through them can most regulations be sustainably adapted, and therefore the proposals relating to the Transatlantic Dialogue between Legislators and the Transatlantic Assembly are of the utmost importance.
Someone spoke of helicopters.
Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to see you here and listen to your speech.
This is what I would stress in this agreement.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a very strong signal to women who help the self-employed work of their wives.
Anyone who has been in Gaza following the conflict may weigh the enormous suffering of the population.
(ES) Madam President, the relationship with the United States is the European Union's most important strategic partnership.
I must say that our ambition is to achieve a political agreement at the June European Council.
However, we all know that Europe cannot do more and cannot do it better through less money.
At the same time, the large number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting is giving my hope that the performance of such allies can succeed in the long term.
Mr President, I would like to support the proposal that there should be no resolution, because I heard Mr Schulz say something, which is very important in my opinion, namely that if we really want this debate to be about'Europe' and not just Italy, there is no question of voting on a resolution entitled'Freedom of Information in Italy'.
I therefore decided to vote in favour of this report.
This recommendation by Parliament proposes to adopt the regulation tabled by the Council and not to delay it any longer, since this new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and ensure equal treatment of legal residents of third countries in the field of social security.
This is a very replacing percentage that I mentioned in a report that I drafted in the last parliamentary term.
But an EU policy on the Arctic is perhaps not as strange as the appointment of the highly incompetent Baroness Ashton, the Sarah Palin on the left before studantil, as High Representative.
Another achievement of this kind is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October, which is simply the most ambitious trade agreement signed by the European Union and which must remain a reference point for our future bilateral trade agreements.
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that what is needed is a reduction, and their position represents a weak starting point for the negotiations.
As far as the car industry is concerned, I believe that we have not given enough importance to the development of completely different models, models that function with hydrogen, with batteries or pieces of fuel.
Then we will continue on separated roads.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union.
As a Thailand partner, the European Union is ready to support it as much as possible throughout this complex process.
Indeed, in order to ensure that such an exemption, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of real benefit to local populations and does not harm the EU's fish processing and canning industry, it was vital to provide an assessment of the impact as quickly as possible and to allow for its suspension, if necessary.
That is what the Commission and the Council are doing right now, in order to ensure that the gas supply is restored as quickly as possible; threatening with legal actions is certainly not a very effective course.
It is essential that Member States investigate the enormous human rights abuses against Roma women without delay, which punish those who commit them and ensure that all victims are identified and provided with redress.
(LT) Mr President, this is really a rather complex issue.
I would like to draw your attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies, but also - and this has not been said - on the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with the committees responsible for EU affairs, budgets and budgetary control.
My suggestion would be that, now that the European External Action Service is setting its rules on access to information and documents, it should make it a modern organisation, accessible to citizens and not treat foreign policy as if it were only the playing field of some watertight diplomats.
Currently, all countries are amending their economic policies with the aim of emerging from the economic situation as quickly as possible, and at least generating some economic growth.
Let me also talk to you about the Japanese people.
Mr Barroso replied that these were internal issues.
That is why we are among those who believe that this should not be weakened, but rather preserved and strengthened.
It is not a secret that the origins of our European identity originate directly from Christian tradition.
While it is very useful for large companies, it is relocating public transport and is responsible for the decent state of the network and safety.
On the other hand, the debate on Turkey's future accession to the EU cannot be set aside.
This risk must be managed effectively and, as the tragic events in Japan remind us, urgently.
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers from the risk of injuries caused by all kinds of sharp instruments employed in medicine.
In a nutshell, my report may have been completed this evening, but the work is not even so remotely finished, either for me or for the European institutions.
Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work, and I would like to stress that my group - from the outset - was very cautious in accepting SIS II, due to its many implications relating to data protection.
The necessary conditions need to be in place.

As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to ask the President of the Commission a question, who has been dealing with the pictures we have been seeing for the last few weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing the situation in Africa have managed to reach Europe, while others have not achieved it.
However, that is not what happens, and a sad example of that is what we have in Lampedusa.

In this respect, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment calling for - not only in relation to Europe, of course, especially to address the United States, as the Commissioner knows - to finalise all export subsidies in the short term.
Most taxpayers insist that the CAP be translated, or focused, into environmental objectives, such as competition from European agriculture, responsibility for climate change, food security and quality requirements.
We also believe that the negotiations of the Central America Agreement should be concluded before the Madrid Summit next May.
The next item is the debate on:

I voted in favour of the European Ombudsman's special report following the draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676/2008/RT, which relates to the Commission's excessive delay in providing an answer to the Ombudsman's services.
The main progress made by this directive, compared to the existing legislation, is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and will have access to information on the quality and safety of the care they receive.
I repeat, we need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund flexibly and to review the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund with a view to adapting them to the requirements arising from this tragedy.
Having consulted with consumer organisations and representatives of the business world, I understand that even greater harmonisation of consumer rights in the European Union needs to be insisted on.
I have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad thing about this debate.
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case, trade negotiations - and to intervene politically with the parliamentary means at its disposal, such as hearings, resolutions and oral questions, in order to be kept informed about the progress of these negotiations.

We need to ensure that a free society has the tools and appropriate measures to fight and defeat those who want to destroy it.
One good example is the case with Iceland, which, when it was a rich country, had no interest in joining the European Union.
This is not a new request, Mr Vice-President.
It is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in ensuring a very high level of local acceptance.
However, it is a problem that will export the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions while continuing the fight in Afghanistan.

on behalf of the S & D Group. - (LT) The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats cannot remain indifferent to the recent killings of human rights activists perpetrated in Russia.

Therefore, I also call once again for the implementation of the International Day on 25 May to be declared an Honour of the Heroes of the Fight Totalitarianism because many people who, like Pilecki, lost their lives fighting for fundamental rights and freedoms, deserve to be remembered.
Let me briefly refer to what we have done.
If this were to become the majority opinion in the European Union in the next parliamentary term, it would destroy the peace plan, which has such significant funding and which was established after the Balkan war.
I sincerely hope that this will encourage people to take part in EMAS, not because I am calling on to play a game of numbers and see EMAS by competing with ISO, but because I think that this scheme is a good scheme and could help us meet our sustainability criteria.

It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák's report, with which I fully agree, and I believe that this report will enable us to better define the legal framework for the urban issue, as well as to introduce tools such as municipal operational programmes capable of providing greater quality for cohesion policy.
During the trialogue negotiations, it became clear to me that the improvements made by me on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and effective energy markets.

In other words, there is no need to make an application to Brussels.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, for us and for Europe, for the Committee on ITRE, and for us in Europe, energy has clearly become an instrument of foreign policy, an element of change that can generate conflict and bring us together, and that is precisely the subject in hand today.
I voted in favour of the report because the food programme under consideration for which its extension is being considered is a key instrument for helping the deprived people who are facing a huge challenge in the current economic crisis, even when it comes to meeting basic needs.
Most industrialised countries, including all EU Member States, have at least one official export credit agency, and these agencies are collectively the world's largest source of official funding for private sector projects.

I am thinking specifically of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system.
The decision to enter into dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is of particular importance to stability in the area.
A accident is therefore to be expected in a reactor every 25 years every year.

Today is the time to speak out once again about the violation of religious rights in both countries, this time against Christians.
Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing our planet.
Of course, as I was hoping, particular emphasis was placed on human rights, on the importance of ensuring clearly what is part of the dynamic relations we have and which covers our work.
I must also say that, for the moment, the European Union has no jurisdiction in the regulation of air traffic.
However, Europe is neither a mutiny nor a cure for the economic crisis.
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment made by the Commission to comitology and optional provisions.
I do not think that any of the warm words spoken here today, not even those that the Commission has dedicated, can change the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya and that, for the moment, it is not even able to put an end to the crisis in the cities or the actions of the ground troops of Mr Gaddafi.
This is why I strongly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two EU regulations, it will greatly benefit because they will have many more options for making a choice.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I share the hope that measures will be agreed at the European Council to reassure the markets and restore stability in the euro area, because, if we are members and if we are not, it is in everyone's interest.
In this respect, pre-accession aid funds have proved to be particularly susceptible.
That is a reason to be very grateful and to be very grateful.
We therefore call on all parties to end war and violence, and we call on the EU to act accordingly.

The indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings will have to be included in advertising advertisements or rental advertisements appearing in the media.
It is essential to promote efforts aimed at increasing EU investments aimed at the diversification of cross-border structures, incentives for generating alternative and non-conventional forms of energy at local level and improvements in infrastructure capacity to facilitate the connection of new energy sources.
Very developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market which, as a result, is a growth in internal demand and economic activity.
Secondly, we should consider creating a rapid reaction instrument within the ENP to provide a swift and flexible response to the political changes in partner countries, as we have recently seen with our southern neighbours.
I believe that the fact that someone from Parliament who supported Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission is simply grotesde.
The problem, then, is that nothing else is listening to you who do so in the original version.
We have lost a lot of money.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted the importance of issues of concern to our citizens, to our electorate, namely environmental and climate change, the financial crisis, the protection of employment and the fight against crime, since, in order to do a good job, we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us.
The EU budget cannot, as some European Members say, be used as a supplement to national budgets at a time of austerity; instead, it should reflect the difficult situation in which the EU Member States find themselves.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty has not given the Council power to treat the national constitutions of the Member States.
We are not in a normal situation.
It is a cynical pity, but students do not always come to study and tourists are not always visiting for a limited period of time.
Is the global financial crisis, which became the economic crisis, the cause of this situation, or are we facing our own mistakes here, neglected and unattended?

The main objective of these regimes has been and is to unify the territory of this huge state, which is inhabited by a large variety of different peoples.
(PL) Although many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe, we are still facing negative consequences.
That is the case in many respects with Japan, but I recognise Japan's right, for example, to protect its rice market, its steel growers, pay their farmers higher prices than those in world markets and to say no to mass imports that would destroy their farming population, just as I recognise our economies the right to protect certain sectors of activity.
(ES) Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts: coordination and flexibility.
For example, only 15% of elderly people use the Internet.
I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen social priority, as I told you when we discuss the general policy guidelines for the next mandate.
Therefore, Commissioner, I will go to my heart and ask you what measures - and the plural use in this case - the Commission intends to adopt in the short term to eliminate these shortcomings.
That is precisely what has not happened so far or has not been clearly presented to our citizens.
It is not in the interests of the citizens, and rightly so.
(The sitting was closed at 00.10.)
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal, by adopting by a large majority Mrs Muscardini's report, which I thank, together with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Susta.
At the same time, Romania has supported the open-door policy, aimed especially at strengthening NATO's relations with Georgia and Ukraine.

I am thinking not only of accidents at work, which often occur, but also of dangerous substances used in labour processes.
In September 2009, the Council initiated a detailed examination of the proposal amending the decision to set up a European Refugee Fund.
At the moment, it is important that we take particular account of the island and the outermost regions which, in addition to the permanent barriers that they already have, are now facing infrastructure and personal, commercial and agricultural property and devastated agricultural property and, in many cases, cannot resume their daily activities immediately, especially in regions that depend almost exclusively on tourism, as the media image of events could deter potential deterrents.
We had not seen such a protracted disruption in industry and with enormous financial losses since 11-S and, despite the financial difficulties that all Member States are currently facing, I would urge them to support the aid plans for an industry that simply cannot bear new losses.
At the same time, we have to acknowledge that exposure also increases the risks.
Madam President, I voted in favour of the resolution because the situation in Congo is horrible.
(ES) Mr President, I have a small linguistic comment, perhaps also a semantics one.

Consumer organisations are in favour of binding measures for a judicial programme of collective redress in all Member States combined with other options, such as the extension of existing extra-judicial dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR) for collective claims.
The problem is not Turkish Cypriots, as some people say.
I would ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their home countries without having to suffer long and distressing journeys to reach consumer countries.
That is what we need to do.
I really ask myself, ladies and gentlemen, what it has been of human rights defenders, who make up in this situation, as we in a secular and pluralistic West, and who pardon't the eyes of a Middle East that is slowly reserved for a single religion.
This is taking place and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries.
Mr President, bankers who squander our money are despicable, but, Mr Schulz, politicians who now want to load the deficit and debt on the shoulders of the younger generations show identical responsibility.
I must therefore thank the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various groups.
We now believe that this is the turn of the Member States to do their part.
Mr President, cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for democracy and human rights was a good one; in fact, the relationship was very cooperative.
We should ensure that the programmes provided give the greatest possible support to the reforms undertaken in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union.
It is also very important for each Member State to maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information on the availability of medical services, procedures and documentation required.
A long time ago, we experienced any event in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure, but now we discussed trade operations in conditions of absolute individual freedom.
Regardless of whether public or private funds are considered, that report is on a very specific issue, namely that Parliament states, firstly, that it has no legal right to subsidise its deficits and, secondly, that there will be no subsidy of deficits.
There is no doubt that their faces are the most expensive since Helena de Trojan mobilised a thousand vessels.
The aid leading to distortion of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences for both employment and technical development.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it seems to me that we should take some things into account in the forthcoming debate.
You have already heard from a number of speakers who have said that they want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse'vote mechanism.
(FR) Now, it seems very important to me that we remember what is really at stake in this matter.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 (8)
To show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric ritual ritual, I would encourage you to have a rotacute screen today that symbolises our opposition to this practice.
Democratic control has been left aside if we consider national governments to be heard behind the Commission and the Troika in the most basic measures, while the Commission is referring these matters back to national governments.
A new multiannual financial framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate)
Following the threats from the committee with demands from the European Court of Justice, Sweden has now begun to allow the fall in the ETS.
To those of us who come from rural constituencies, and members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it is obvious to us that the situation in which so many farmers currently find themselves, is simply untenable.
The saving public is worthy of transparent, easily understandable and accessible information.
I believe that our work could be to support the Chinese people to make that harmonious society a reality.
I supported these two mechanisms in the vote because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and therefore safeguard our future.
It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - a social organisation or a non-governmental organisation - clearly and explicitly specifies the issue and the aim of the initiative, even though he does not necessarily have to submit a proposal for legislation.
There is a city in Latvia, Daugavavpils, where more than 90% of the population is about Russia.
I would like to applaud here Prime Minister Jan Fischer's apologies, as well as the recent proposal by the Czech Government, which calls for the Ministry of Health to be held by 31 December 2009 to take a number of measures to ensure that such violations do not go back on 31 December 2009.
I welcome this report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark for policy makers worldwide.
The effects of globalisation have now been fully crushed by the financial and economic crisis and our measured reaction is the adaptation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund funding criteria.
in writing. - (PT) This resolution takes into account Kosovo's declaration of independence of 17 February 2008, which was acknowledged by 69 countries, and encourages the Member States to work together on their common approach to Kosovo, taking into account Kosovo's planned accession to the EU.
Comparted with any of the other institutions, Parliament can still be seen as the leader talking about transparency, and so it would not have it within my primary priorities, since with regard to the accessibility of documents and the transparency of its sessions and the activities of Members of the European Parliament, openness is greater than in any national parliament.
It was the drafting of internal policies by the Italian Minister for reforms, Umberth Bossi.
The Monitoring Centre for Human Rights of Asturias - my region - and many other organisations, deserve credibility.
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini's report.
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution on the ban on thrombin and pigmeat.

However, the European Commission's data is also not entirely suitable for determining the measures to be taken to disciplinate the Member States with the greatest rates of irregularities and fraud.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism.
(The sitting was closed at 16.25)
Most importantly, improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors outside the emissions trading scheme by 20%.
As regards the second question, I can assure you that the Commission is aware that control of antimicrobial resistance requires a multidisciplinary approach.
The trialogue yesterday gives us hope of a final agreement.
Projections for the future, based on an annual growth rate of around 27% in the coming years, indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015.
However, I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision.
Many people asked me what ACTA means, and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.
I voted in favour of this report as this EU financial assistance will help people who have been victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and help them escape from the courses of recession.
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and for the development and knowledge of citizens in cultural terms, especially through the dissemination of audiovisual content, I am in favour of the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in radio and radio spectrum software and development.
All this adds to the usual concerns about the geographical and cultural differences between Turkey and Europe and to the problems which would lead to the accession of a country which shares borders with 80 million inhabitants: factors that will continue to strengthen my unshakeable conviction that it is not right for Turkey to be part of a Europe whose unity depends, above all, on the spirit of Christianity.
Thank you, Mr President.
(Protests from the floor)
This means acting against the safety of the environment and consumers, because they would return to the old appliances that they consume so much and are potentially dangerous.

I wanted to put on record my thanks to the Balingen mayor, Dr Reitemann, and the local council for enabling the memorial to be carried out in honour of the lives of these men.

Anyone who has experienced and seen the results of the environmental catastrophe caused by the technology failures in Baia Mare, and the subsequent spillage of cyanide in water courses, with serious effects on the face of the flash of the river in Hungary, as well as on the Danube in Bulgaria, would do everything possible to prevent something like to happen again in the European Union.
It is everyone's job: it is the job of the Member States, it is the Commission's job, it is the job of the Council, it is the job of Parliament.
In future climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year.
Secondly, there is the right of displaced people to return their homes and property: the fundamental freedom of movement, as you said, to cross dividing lines.
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in rejecting the Commission's proposal.
What is essential is that we have had the courage to convene this summit, which we have invited the social partners, whom we will work together in their long-term preparation - before the Employment Summit in Stockholm, Madrid and Prague - and that we are doing everything we can to make the results we achieve useful for the June European Council.
The European Parliament, in particular, found a good basis for the correct application of cross-border health care standards in the Member States, so that patients could, if justified and in accordance with the rules stipulated and without overburdening the courts, receive in another Member State the ambulatory or hospital they need.
This was also proposed in the Barnier report, but so far, we have not reached a conclusion.
There is no time to waste.
Due to a new grotesde exercise in distortion of reality, we are once again faced with an innovative attempt by the European Parliament to interfere in Venezuela.
At the end of 2009, the Commission published a discussion document which included new data and different kinds of users' opinions on this issue, and at one point we will mention the outcome of this public survey.
Thank you for your participation.
I would add that, where nothing is done to a person, this is what the European Convention on Human Rights stipulates.
I hope that this amendment will receive the support of the majority tomorrow.
The Copenhagen Communication is the basis for developing the European Union's position on these key elements, and it will allow us to maintain our leadership and help make the negotiations in Copenhagen useful.
