I also call on the Council Presidency to make a statement similar to our resolution on this occasion and also in June on the occasion of the massacre in Tiananmen Square .
I therefore support the obligation , strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon , to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights , the fight against social exclusion and discrimination and the promotion of justice and social protection .
The EU is like a building block and therefore the concept of halting its expansion would contravene the very principle on which it is based .
I trust that with today &apos;s vote the European Parliament has contributed at least a little to the conservation of fish stocks and the health of the marine environment , as well as to the reform of the common fisheries policy .
Firstly , between these parties , I must mention the former President of South Africa and the African Union Chairman , Thabo Mbeki , and his mediating performance , and I think we must also highlight the role of mediation played by our special representative for Sudan , Rosalind Marsden .
Thanks to the social economy actors who took action and made it possible for this Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission to finally acknowledge a single European Statute for mutual societies , associations and foundations .
As far as the financial markets are concerned , let us talk about the financial markets as part of the economy and not as an isolated sector , as we will never achieve investment or jobs if we consider the financial markets to be an isolated issue .
There are a call for elections and candidates who are withdrawn , as we are seeing in all means , because they understand that there are no democratic conditions for them .

Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
However , and I think this is what concerns many Members , we need to be very careful about the means we use to provide rapid and fundamental exoneration to this vulnerable economic sector .
It is therefore essential that we do not confine ourselves to a technical review of the treaties , and that the two main shortcomings of the euro area that has highlighted the crisis be addressed .
We are therefore proposing a regulation and guidelines that will facilitate the potential and opportunities of small businesses throughout the whole chain , from the manufacture of parts to the repair of vehicles .
Of course .
Today , after the events in Georgia , and after Russia &apos;s recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia enclaves , Russia &apos;s willingness to create a joint security area with the European Union and the positions of the parties on matters concerning Kosovo and common neighbourhood are more divergent than ever .
We have drawn up a common standard in the European Union in the area of minority rights , and that is an absolute necessity .
However , the supervision of macroeconomic imbalances and the videos of competitiveness are particularly justified in the case of EU Member States that joined the euro because of the high level of indirect profits in economic and financial matters in all euro area Member States - less market discipline ; lack of risks in exchange rates and more challenging adjustment at a potentially high cost for the euro area as a whole .
For my country , and especially for the citizens affected , it is important that this decision be adopted by the European Parliament .
It is not enough simply to add the word &apos; solidarity &apos; by way of an amendment to make European energy policy acceptable , when , moreover , this same amendment prohibits the EU from intervening in the functioning of the market .
The aim is to eliminate the usual practice of the railway sector in using national rules to hinder the approval of the rolling stock that has already been approved in other states .

Recent reports by the Stern magazine , at least 70 German MEPs were members of this fund .
Commissioner , I would also have been able to comment on other reports , but I was not given the floor .
We also need a very serious campaign of sponsored information from the European Union .
You will not be surprised that I am strongly in favour of the first of these options .
We must create an appropriate framework for our contractual relations , since the agreement on trade and cooperation currently in force , as it is very limited , does not allow us to do so .
On the other hand , however , I see the glass as a vacuum as a vacuum because , as far as the common agricultural policy is concerned , it makes numerous references to public goods and services that agriculture must produce for the population , but very few to primary agricultural production and the competitiveness of this sector .
Although I am very keen to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected , as well as my support for the councils of the affected councils , I would like to take this forum to appeal to the European Community : this type of situation requires a response at European level and , above all , European solidarity .
I hope that my comments on these reports and their conclusions will be relatively brief .
( BG ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Bulgarian public recently witnessed a series of publications on the use of special surveillance equipment to hear surreptiously high government charges .

Written statements ( Rule 149 )
In order to promote stability between its eastern neighbours and reduce its consequences for the Member States , the EU must adopt a strong policy towards Russia , which must be drawn up in close cooperation with the transatlantic allies and include the competent multilateral organisations , as well as the OSCE .
We can make it triumph , so we all - Parliament , the Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank - must unite in finding a healthy path .
Furthermore , the Council of Ministers is still not involved , which means that not all the key legislative bodies are on board .
The maritime transport strategy until 2018 has been used very well during the preparation of the Commission &apos;s Europe 2020 strategy , and the process for drawing up a new White Paper on Transport is under way .
Some of the most important shops in the world , such as Carrefour and al-Mart , have already banned Brazilian beef by arguing that this industry is responsible for deforestation .
As a result of the financial and economic crisis , Iceland became the fifth most affluent country in the world to be overwhelmed by the crisis : the banking system collapsed , 40 % of families could not pay their bills , and pensioners lost their savings for an entire life .
This makes sense if the relevant data do not really impose any additional burden , in other words , if the Member States are in a position to charge these data with already existing data sources .
Only last month we had the scandal of East Anglia &apos;s University ; then we had the debacle with regard to Himalayan glaciers and now , we have doubts about the impact that climate change will have on the flora and fauna of Amazon areas .
Bo≈æ√≠ pokoj s Vami !

In accordance with point 15 of the resolution , I believe it is essential that all free trade agreements include negotiated social and environmental standards , including the following : a list of minimum standards to be respected by the whole EU trade partners , as well as a list of additional conventions to be implemented gradually and flexibly , taking into account the development of the economic , social and environmental situation in question .
( LT ) Madam President , the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste is particularly important , both for the environment and for people and for society .
Canada &apos;s main negotiator agreed to admit to the start of this year that the agreement was a priority for its country .
This is something that has gradually been phased out by accepting in the European Union , and in this sense energy security has become a strategic priority of the Union .
Perhaps the system does not allow economic elasticity and self-determination to be used so that governments can address idiocratic problems , such as inflation rates , effectively .

No !
Vaccination of peaceful protests with criminal acts , such as those in Athens , is a serious mistake .
What we did in the Harbour and Trautmann reports was essentially the choice .
This resolution covers a number of important issues .
We can finish with a positive note , which is important , especially before the elections .
In order for the EU to be able to mediate in the peace process as a credible player , it is necessary to show that it applies the EU &apos;s fundamental values to all intents and that it also fulfils the acquis of international law in a consistent manner at any time and in the face of any situation .
The creation of a unitary European patent applicable to the entire European Union will have advantages for all the affected users and , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , as it will contribute to the competitiveness of the same people by enabling them to cut costs .
The European Parliament &apos;s view on this matter will be welcomed in view of the European Council in March .
The reason for this measure is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market , as we are convinced that the economic development achieved in this way must increase political stability throughout the region .

After a fraudulent trial and his imprisonment away from his family , which hinders visits , Taoufik Ben Brik presents a state of health that causes fear for his life .
This positive trend , however , has not been accompanied by the protection and improvement of passenger rights : passengers have pointed out many problems including cancellations , excesses of reserves , baggage losses and delays .
However , it gives the feeling that the first thing we will do will be food shortages , since 1 billion people are starving in the world .
Unfortunately , however , the real objective seems to have been to have been the conquest and assault of our small and medium-sized enterprises .
I understand that the issue of geographical balance , which is so often clarified , could have been resolved in a much better way .
On the other hand , we cannot ignore worrying tendencies in the area of media freedom .
I really do not understand how this kind of criticism can be levelled against the European institutions , using the death of so many people .
We are closely monitoring the Commission &apos;s commitment to welcoming the important proposals in this report , in the belief that full recognition of the central role of the urban dimension in EU policies is an indispensable condition for its success .

( FI ) Madam President , this debate was very interesting and it seems that the European Parliament is very determined to support the Copenhagen conference on climate change .
Regardless of the events that led to this conflict beginning , it is already having adverse effects of significant proportions on civilians in the area and on the United Nations &apos; presence in Gaza .
I say this because it is , above all , the poorest and most vulnerable populations who are suffering , and we cannot stand idly by .
I trust that the US authorities will also have the same level of interest in equal treatment of Member States in relation to the visa waiver programme .
If Mrs Roure wants to go to Lampedusa tomorrow morning , she will find not a single child - if she reads the Italian press , she will find that it was Mr Maroni who brought to light organ trafficking : children used to disappear from Lampedusa when we had a Left-wing government in our country .
I do not deny that nuclear power can be part of a well-balanced European energy channel , and that its use can decrease our external dependence in this field , but I believe that the European Union cannot abstract from the joint effort to close this obsolete nuclear infrastructure while ensuring that economic recovery projects have adequate funding .
The decisions of the NATO Summit , as well as the statements by the US President , for example , confirm that NATO is not resisting the common security and defence policy , but rather seeks to find a way of cooperating that is beneficial to both institutions .
Mr Schmidt has proposed an amendment concerning the voluntary participation of non-euro Member States in the sanctions regime .
Mr Leinen &apos;s report shows how the Treaty will affect Parliament &apos;s work , and it looks closely at the implications that the new policy areas , new powers and new procedures will have for Parliament .
I do not want to make accusations , but experience shows that we must do better next time .
Thank you very much .
We do not understand how this can be the subject of discussion , doubt and questioning of the Union &apos;s powers within the Council , when the Treaty clearly stipulates that this is an area where the EU also has responsibilities .
Minorities are being persecuted , particularly the Bahrai community .
We are all committed to the protection of nature and public health , but there is also a need to maintain a certain balance .
We must now , of course , use this to achieve a Community policy on asylum and a Community policy on immigration .
If the Afghans have to adapt , we , too , have to do so by helping them achieve a successful model of state that combines modernity and Afghan tradition .
I think this is the right time to review the terms of this fundamental debate .
Moreover , with the current stalemate in Africa , Europe is increasingly intimidated by immigration flows , which may prove exhaustive to the welfare state .
The introduction of a minimum wage is a decision which must be left exclusively to the Member States .
The present motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement ( FTA ) between the European Union and India .
Furthermore , the Council has mentioned once again the importance of subsequent improvements in access to funding - I am referring to credit , collateral , funding &apos; for settlements &apos; , and so on - and also to venture capital for innovative venture companies from recent small and medium-sized enterprises where necessary to take account of the effects of the current financial crisis .
The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of the same coin .
Mr Verhofstadt , the liberal alternative , and Mr Juncker , the federalist alternative , were not acceptable .
Finally , the Agadir Agreement should be expanded in order to improve the development of South-South exchanges .
I therefore hope that we will be able to improve the security of children by increasing the number of material on the Internet that can encourage them , educate them and serve them to develop them , and not that number of things that we see today are , unfortunately , a great deal and may harm the development of the general personality of young people .
That would be regrettable .
MEPs have said &apos; no &apos; to flexible reply and &apos; no &apos; to the unacceptable pressure exerted by France on the main democratic body on the continent of Europe !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the international community is putting a great deal of its credibility in Afghanistan at stake .
However , our arguments must be founded , so that citizens do not consider the European Union to be solely interested in itself , but can see that they are concerned about the interests of their people .
This explains why we are still witnessing what is a timid request from some members asking the Member States to receive innocent prisoners who cannot return to their own countries for fear of being tortured .
As is often the case with European Union law , the Commission was asked , last a while , to submit a report on the implementation and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions on whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act .
Naturally , banning all political parties is a bad idea , but there are certain exceptions to that rule .
We cannot deny that , in the last decade , tourism has changed radically , thanks , among other things , to technological progress .
Only when Turkey is committed unambiguously to good neighbourly relations , addressing outstanding problems peacefully in accordance with the United Nations Charter and other European documents , will there be hope .
We have learned the lessons of our past and the need to act immediately in order to prevent things from happening again in the same terms .
Then he returned to the black man who was sitting with the South South African lady and told him &apos; Haga in favour of collecting his things , gentleman , I have a seat for you in the first class part of the plane &apos; .
Secondly , the concept of &apos; one-stop shop &apos; could be more useful in the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) to increase the potential for European businesses to invest and export .
You represent a country whose citizens faced the invasion of the troops of the Warsaw Pact .
The directive states that fund managers must be registered and authorised and must respect strict codes of conduct within the European Union .
Three years ago , a visa facilitation agreement was adopted with Russia and an amendment was adopted which had already been tabled saying that the requirement for a compulsory registration procedure is a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU .
People are simply dreaming of a better life , and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy .
It is clear that the inhabitants of the affected areas remain isolated in terms of communication across the country , and the capacity of civilian aviation resources is limited .
It should be remembered that these policies must always be implemented in the context of respect for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I said , in conclusion , that we will act as a headquarters of the conference and I would like you to consider it , depending on your availability , of course , to accept my invitation to attend part of this meeting , Baroness Ashton .

The principles of the rule of law must be respected .
What a difference !
Under the Copenhagen political criteria , Turkey is expected to guarantee cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all its citizens , as set out in the partnership for accession .
Europe &apos;s commitment to its citizens is therefore illustrated by Parliament &apos;s determination to provide it in the 2011 budget , despite its very low margins , and thus to give consistency to this fund .
That is why the parliamentary question was endorsed by this vast majority in the Commission , which I am very grateful for .
To conclude , I would like to say that the fact that a rapporteur from one of the small groups took on such a complicated dossier with the active cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups is a very important sign of democracy and one of which this institution should be proud .
I believe it is essential to support Europe &apos;s SMEs , along with the total liberalisation of the free movement of people , goods and services , in order to maximise the benefits of the Single Market .
But there are also other concerns .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 : 00 .
Mrs Swinburne &apos;s report is presented at an important juncture of the reform process for the regulation .
Ladies and gentlemen , part of what is being requested here is simply pointless and I will therefore vote against the report .
However , we now need to make the positive results of last year also reflect at the level of the Copenhagen conference .
As far as disarmament or the missile shield is concerned , the EU must make its position clear to Russia and the United States .
I do not need to tell you that the tools for cohesion , and above all the funds , must represent European added value for our fellow citizens , but today , in this context of a number of serious crises beating Europe , they must be more receptive and , in particular , adapted more to urban situations .
While in connection with the first problem , we have funds for development and cooperation programmes financed by the EU , which are obviously not enough , in the case of the second problem , the problem has so far been addressed in different ways by the Member States .
A catalogue of all private quality certification systems needs to be drawn up and a legislative framework of basic principles needs to be adopted at EU level to ensure that these systems work transparently .
However , we will prepare a final assessment once the final rule on the electronic travel authorisation system has been published , and this evaluation will also address the issue of the charging of this system , if it is actually implemented .
Madam President , as we know , there are many hazardous chemical substances permitted for general use despite the dangerous ingredients they contain .
- ( FR ) Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I discovered thanks to the Czech historians the reason why they did not ratify the Treaty of Lisbon : they talk of magic de 8 , as in 2008 .
The &apos; New Deal &apos; green &apos; or , in other words , another logic for economic organisation , based on innovations on environmental technology and supporting international capital markets , will become the cornerstone of an increasing number of economic and rescue plans , including among the Member States of the European Union .
Bilateral agreements in some Member States , such as the implementation of projects such as &apos; Nord Stream &apos; , create mistrust not only for environmental issues , but also for the principles of solidarity , and so transparency must be ensured in this area .
And I think that is a good thing , I think that is important .
We are all aware that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy and this is clearly reflected in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , the important thing now is for the Commission and the Member States to know to be gifted in Copenhagen .
My second comment relates to the idea of putting multilateralism into perspective , an idea that has so often been said in this House .
In Parliament , many fellow Members from the various political groups have already shown their involvement , but our duty is to place greater political emphasis on this issue .
I believe that our primary task is to complete the whole process , consolidation of the Single Market , with the most transparent means possible in close cooperation with the European Parliament .
I think one way of doing this is to use the Dutch proverb : &apos; All monks of the same order must be apprehended by the same skill &apos; .
For this reason , I am asking the European Ombudsman to encourage national ombudsmen more to hold regular meetings in order to exchange impressions with his parliaments , inspiring on the exchanges between the European Ombudsman and you in the European Parliament .
Firstly , the creation and maintenance of jobs , with a particular emphasis not so much on social aid , but on investment in infrastructure and entrepreneurial recovery , so that jobs can be created .
Madam President , Mrs Figueiredo has expressed this in an excellent way , and I would just like to add one thing .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the removal of the previous pillar structure , all the conditions of the US visa waiver programme now fall within the remit of the EU .
We therefore welcome the Commission &apos;s initiative and , with the consent of my colleague , Mrs Lochbihler , we fully support it .
We have a significant problem with regard to competition between two courts : that of Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice .
This includes harmonising the labelling of sizes , socio-economic labelling and , most worrying of all , a radio frequency identification label which would increase costs for businesses and consumer prices .
( SV ) Mr President , the greatest failure in Europe today is that we cannot yet put an end to the trafficking of people that is taking place before our own eyes .
So , as you can see , investment is being made in the economic and social situation in the functioning of Europe , in European culture .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , as it was important to put this topic on the table .
As medicines for the treatment of this disease are very expensive , and the majority of patients cannot afford it , it is desirable to obtain funding for these medicines .
I would like to express once again on behalf of everyone here our heartfelt condolences and our solidarity with the victims and their families .
If this process is reopened , I sincerely hope that the perpetrators are and stopped , because otherwise the bloodshed can be even greater and could be interpreted as a licence to commit such acts .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
We must call on regional and local authorities as well as all the other stakeholders , and urge them to take advantage of this second opportunity .
The EU must adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effective in preventing and detecting fraud so that public funds can only be adequately used , without prejudice to the effective punishing of those who , in breach of the rules , intend to illegally appropriate these funds , which are scarce by nature .
I therefore cannot agree with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s view that the whole package has only one effective measure , that is to say , the reverse qualified majority voting .
The challenges were huge : there was the transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and also the development of the next multiannual programme , which will define the priorities to be given to the area of freedom , security and justice for the next five years .
I think we have a currency that is , in fact , strong , also in historical terms .
It is essential for everything that we are going to do in the country to ensure that there really is a rule of law and that it is implemented in the legal system , of course , but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so necessary .
It is within this framework that the problems that raise the needs for functioning and the harmonisation of expenditure of the European Parliament and the European Union must be addressed .
We know this .
This measure refuses to give proper consideration to the evaluation of products before they are put on the market and does not make a single mention of the dangers , reported time and time again , representing the marketing of GMOs .
You rightly said that we must first of all prevent the Finance from fire , and that is the decisive point I would like to discuss .
The question of whether drug addicts should face up to criminal charges is a matter for the right of the Member States and the EU should not focus their efforts on thering the course of justice .
You are waiting .
The Member States must now take appropriate measures which could involve the prevention of hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths in the poorest homes of the continent .
Then we will leave it until we have the final vote .
No regional or economic integration will be achieved if the Union does not have the courage to tackle existing conflicts and to do so on the basis of international law .
What we want to see now is for its implementation to be carried out very quickly and we ask the Commission to put resources at the disposal of this process .
I agree with the rapporteur when she states that the proper transposition , implementation and enforcement of companies &apos; Unfair Commercial Practices in their relations with consumers in the internal market and misleading advertising and comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the objectives set out in the directives , particularly in view of the different methods of implementation and implementation by the Member States , the complexity of the directive of some misleading national legal concepts and misleading practices of the directive .
The European Union should intervene and adopt legislative measures to ensure gender equality and reduce gender segregation in the labour market .
The fact is , consumers have the right to a given basic information , for example , &apos; What is they bought ? &apos; , &apos; What is they doing ? &apos; and what about where comes ?
Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s debate , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Rule 47 of the Commission Regulation in 2006 .
I would also like to remind you of the World Trade Organisation &apos;s Employment Pact , which provides for a suitable series of strategic options for enabling us to get out of the crisis .
Given the serious consequences of bluetongue for livestock farmers , we must take the steps to enable good practice in vaccination , so that we protect farmers from loss of animals , which may cause harm that is often fatal for these producers .
Closure of sitting
Mr President , one of the changes that the President spoke about this morning concerns the Citizens &apos; Initiative .
President-in-Office of the Council . - In December 2008 , a programme for 2009 was agreed at the Pozna≈Ñ conference , which clearly identified measures for the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 .
The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up at the Conference of Presidents &apos; meeting on Thursday , 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
in writing . - ( SK ) The aim of this proposal is to ensure that consumers in the 27 EU Member States can rely on a high level of consumer protection , and that businesses in all sizes are able to supply goods and provide services to consumers in all 27 EU Member States without unnecessary legal obstacles .
We must maintain its advantages .
I think we have to vote in favour of the report by Claude Moraes because it is part of a general package on the asylum and immigration system in the Union .

The plan for agricultural aid for the outermost regions of the EU provides an important mechanism for continuing agriculture and preserving the rural field .
If we are to buy a new buildings and have no more than one alternative in perspective , then it is difficult for us to get some beneficial terms .
This financial instrument shares the basic principle that there must be complementarity between all financing instruments .
I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the situation in Haiti one year after the earthquake : humanitarian aid and reconstruction .
I am not in any way in favour of market protectionism , but I am calling for the strict defence of its good rules : the rules of a market that is healthy and fair .
In other words , the detained people during that period , given the crisis that we are facing , we will have to wait until 2016 or 2017 to return them to Turkey .
The European Commission shares the belief that the growing number of children of migrant origin presents considerable challenges to education systems in most Member States .
When it comes to the day when Members make legislative proposals , each lobbyist will find a Member who defends their interests .
That is why I voted as I did .
This is where the European Economic Recovery Programme comes into play and , of course , this also supports the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Parliament has today voted to ban the authorisation of thrombin as a food additive .
What has happened to solidarity ?
Parliament helped to make the directive more ambitious than the Council &apos;s common position on some important points .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up to provide additional support to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
According to the legal procedure , the Council will adopt the text after the usual days and then the directive can be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the shortest possible time .
Canadian scanners are not inflicable , but they are the best available technology at present , and we need to use the instruments at our disposal to reduce the terrorist threat .
We do not help them by suggesting that they can avoid such a path , which does not help them at all .
One crucial aspect of this initiative is a fundamental value : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my country , Estonia , this fund has not been used , and when I asked why the conditions were very strict and the limit , which so far was a thousand people , was possible .
I believe that , together , we will succeed in establishing the fundamental principles that should guide and facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very worrying to see the increase in the incidence of the violent and merciless attacks against Christians and their communities .
Proposals are also being put forward to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to examine in detail what is happening with regard to debt , to improve economic governance in the euro area by the Euro Group , and to establish a mechanism for preventing and resolving excessive debt that is strong and credible for the euro area , which could involve establishing a European Monetary Fund .
Another problem is the service rate involving outsourcing .
We do not want to &apos; look for the best postor &apos; for existence and create a new Delaware of the European Union , in which businesses can shirk this type of regulation .
Firstly , the 2011 EU budget sets priorities that must be strengthened in view of the problems experienced by the whole of Europe following the structural crisis in recent years .

in writing . - The mid-term review of the financial framework for 2007-2013 is neither practical nor realistic due to the uncertainty associated with the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty , at the end of the current parliamentary term , the outcome of the European elections , and the creation of the new Commission in the current economic situation .

It would be better , however , if they complained about themselves about European leaders .

Thirdly , having an internal market is a key factor in security of supply .

I would therefore simply like to express my surprise and ask that on another occasion , we all know what needs to be done to be able to intervene .
Another reason why I voted in favour of strengthening the OSCE is the issue of human rights , which concerns respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of minorities , and which are key elements of the OSCE &apos;s comprehensive security concept .

The EU is not democratic and is therefore not the most marked protector for the rights of people .

Since we have 27 countries with 27 different health care systems , the Commission proposal , based exclusively on Article 95 - the famous article of harmonisation - will lead to the dismantling of national health care systems and , therefore , the elimination of the responsibilities of the Member States .

The motion for a resolution contains more detailed aspects with which we cannot agree , particularly the promotion of the world &apos;s carbon trading , given that this solution has already demonstrated that it has no advantages in reducing carbon emissions , as well as the creation of more public / private partnerships which emphasise a &apos; substantial increase in investment proportion &apos; , thus using public money to serve private interests and interests .
However , practical aspects of an agreement with a country with the size of the Republic of Congo create a whole series of problems of enormous proportions .
As far as I know , it seems to me that there is only one race : the human race .
President Mubarak today - and I respect his years of hard work - is unable to lead the political transition ; he is crazy to ask him for that and to let the clan Mubarak fix Mubarak put his accounts to the clan Elbaradei in the streets of Cairo .
The social situation has evolved very favourably , with a spectacular increase in average per capita income , and today the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the average class .

All of these elements form a whole which allows us , in my opinion , to provide a coherent response .

That is what it is .

For example , in Central Africa , Cameroon has been criticised , to say no palliative , for her neighbours for having signed this interim agreement with the European Union .
Prime Minister Orb√°n , you are proud of the Hungarian people and you have good reasons for that , but democracy has taught us one thing , from Tococquevile to all the theoretical ones you have studied it : &apos; The truth is not always on the side of the majority &apos; .

Mr President , we are about to conclude a piece of work that we started 10 years ago : I still fully agree with the indignation that caused the Erika accident in December 1999 : the speed with which the Commissioner for Palacio put forward proposals at the moment , the cooperation of the Council , which under pressure from public opinion , in part , was responsible for ensuring that the first two packages were ready in June 2002 , with the European political supervision , the other things , and the first two of the European ports .
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this .
Mr President , first of all , I ask you to accept the apologies of Mr ≈†efƒçoviƒç and Mr Oettinger , who have other commitments and has asked me to represent them .

Instead of one year after the earthquake , we should say a year after the earthquake , because there have been several earthquakes , firstly that of earthquakes , then that of the chaotic distribution of humanitarian aid , then health with the outbreak of cholera , then politics with a lack of transparency in a multi-level elections , probably , at the worst moment that could be chosen , and now the historical earthquake , so to speak of the former dictator , for the country &apos;s humiliating country .
This means that if the same guidelines , policies and pressures continue to apply to Portugal and other countries with weaker economies , divergences will intensify and we will find ourselves in an increasingly serious situation because of the European Union &apos;s lack of solidarity .
The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy - including an external dimension - and also full maritime surveillance in sectors and borders to generate an awareness of the maritime environment of maritime activities , which has an impact , among other things , on maritime safety and protection , but also on compliance with the legislation in general .

There are nearly a billion illiterts in the developing world .
We need to achieve the objective set out in the Treaty of Lisbon , namely a social market economy that produces jobs , brings prosperity and that offers a decent standard of living to all our peoples .
As a representative of an ultra-liberal party , his view is not surprising , but he reflects the more general problem that certain government leaders with a certain political past are perhaps not prepared to take the necessary steps , which require vision and courage , to implement measures that could conflict with their ideological convictions .
We would definitely like to put an end to the times when the concept of stability was used as a change currency , when the concept of stability was used to obtain concessions in the areas of human rights and the principles of democracy .
Mr President , Mr Parish has rightly reminded us of something we have mentioned on many occasions in this House , namely the fact that the way in which we treat animals is reflected in us - how &apos; cultured &apos; and civilised &apos; we are .
In my opinion , the Doha Round is essential for international trade and can help enormously to reduce poverty in developing countries and to distribute the benefits of globalisation in a fairer way .
Unfortunately , it is precisely these that are frequently falsified and often contain no more active substance than sugar and compound of sludge .
Greece will , of course , continue to benefit from the cohesion funds , as it is one of the countries that is benefiting from these cohesion funds , and this is apart from the EU 2020 strategy .
√Ågnes Hankiss was accused by an alleged private complainant crime of defamation committed in public and , in particular , of defamation of the memory of a dead person , the father of the complainant .
Among us , too , is the Ambassador Christoffersen , who was also involved in the negotiations .
The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems to me to be completely balanced , and I welcome the work done by Mr Tababababababella .
The future of this complex compromise is by no means clear .
Madam President , the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted on Monday evening a proposal on the deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka in accordance with Rule 91 of the Rules of Procedure .
This also applies to the Union &apos;s external service .
The creation of a European patent will stimulate innovation and the scientific and technological development of the European Union .
I would like to ask the Commission , the Commissioner and the European Parliament to examine carefully and condemn any practice carried out on EU territory that may favour ethnic or racial discrimination .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the essential issue is , of course , what to do now .
The European Parliament has a duty to speak on this issue .
in writing . - In 2008 , as an MEP for Latvia , I submitted a draft amendment to the Criminal Code of the Republic of Latvia , endowing penalties for cases of domestic violence against women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I am pleased to say that , in practice , no use will be made of exemptions , as there are safe alternatives which both consumers and professionals will prefer to choose in the future .
Secondly , the use of construction materials that are harmful to health , such as asbestos , must be avoided at all costs .
In other words , at the heart of this debate , there are a number of precautions and , above all , conclusions , that we all extracted when we analyse the Detroit successor to which I am referring .
I would like , finally , to highlight in particular the development of maritime corridors and the proposal put forward by Greece last summer on the creation of an observatory on transport in the Eastern Mediterranean .
Perhaps the European Union can learn the lesson from the EUR 2 billion that the China / African Development Fund is investing in Africa .
The interpretation of the Treaty &apos;s articles seems to be dependent on the direction in which the wind is based .
I am in favour of this report , which will also allow Romania to access the funds for facilitating the social integration of marginalised , including Roma , into urban and rural areas .
I would stress that we are talking about international waters here and that Lene Espersen , the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs , has also stated categorically that this is unacceptable .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I had been hopeful that during this sitting Parliament approved the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission for a new five-year term .
- Council and Commission statements on a medium-term financial assistance mechanism for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
At the same time , however , the country was left with no specialists of health , most of whom were Bulgarian .
The interests of big capital , be it economic or financial , and the big powers always replace the interests of solidarity .
The Czech Government , including its President , has every right to say and do what it looks like , but it cannot forget that it belongs to the European Union and that now speaks on behalf of nearly 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
This leads to financial problems , a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness , especially for SMEs .
To conclude , we consider the Instrument for Pre-Accession Aid to be a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate countries and potential candidates .
Meanwhile , we should introduce sanctions such as freezing assets and banning travel .
We are familiar with these practices and our proposals are intended to specifically prevent this surreptitious advertising in various areas .
Once again this year , we see that Russia is threatening to interrupt gas supplies and there are indications that we will have to prepare for this possibility every winter in the future .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for his willingness to reach some compromises in the last minute .
Mr President , I welcome President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to assist the EU-US Summit this month in Lisbon , and today I voted in favour of the resolution .
The administrative arrest of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression and executions are all of them methods that are incompatible with the obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China as a member of the United Nations .
It is not convincing , since this arrest is one of the hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissidence .
That makes no sense .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial situation , Europe must continue to support projects in the energy efficiency sector and renewable energy in order to achieve a competitive and social economy .
The debate on the Single Market and the Services Directive , and on how all this relates to patients &apos; rights , I find this very interesting .
As regards the Tobin Tax and the financial transaction tax , you are right : it is probably not exactly what James Tobin originally imagined .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that I am delighted to know that Turkey is so close to the hearts and minds of my fellow Member , Mr Madlener , the Dutch Party for Freedom .
As stated in the latest Council conclusions , human rights are an issue that should always be dealt with in these high level visits and , where appropriate , meetings with the pro-democratic opposition will be part of those visits .
However , the only thing that Kozloduy was an example is how old reactors can be safe and function perfectly well .
As far as the intention of the Danish Government , which Mrs Koppa mentioned , to rebuild the internal borders of Denmark is concerned , of course , you will know that the President of the Commission immediately wrote a letter to the Prime Minister of Denmark , in which he warned him that the first analysis of the Commission raised serious doubts as to the adequacy of the measures proposed with the obligations under international law and international Denmark .
The European Commission , as the guardian of the Treaty on European Union , must ensure that all the Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and present at length all the necessary information on the expected developments in energy infrastructure .
It is a clear signal from the European institutions that Europe &apos;s citizens disapprove of the brutal abuse and slaughter of animals .
Mr Morel is doing a good job as a special representative , but this is not enough .
I remember that at the hearing with the members of the Court of Auditors , they promised close cooperation with Parliament .
For many private companies , and also for government transport programmes , an additional cost will result in two things : more expensive tickets for customers and less routes .
However , I see sludge and shadow in the reports .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
That is not what we want .
I urge the rapporteur to table an oral amendment to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of actors based on their work on the bloody faith .
( The sitting closed at 23.00 . )
It is not possible , for example , to consider that help should be given to migrant women for their establishment , particularly when it is not specified when they are legal or illegal immigrants .
We agree with the objectives , just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy .
I believe that , in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question of whether the indigenous people who live in the Russian Federation should be raised enough involved in the work of the Arctic Council .
In that ruling , the Court expresses a number of remarks on measures to improve the procedures relating to the lists applied by the UN Sanctions Committee on al-Qaeda and the Taliban .
I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members who took part , the shadow rapporteurs , the rapporteurs and everyone else .
In a context where the economic situation in some countries such as Greece is weakening the euro , the will and determination shown by Mr Draghi to shape a stable course for a strong currency is indispensable to ensuring the credibility of our economy .
Discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation do not take place in European society .
The first is that we need to reach a legally binding agreement .
And an outdated , somehow , was the adoption yesterday in Ecofin of the regulation of hedge funds .
Welcome
I voted in favour of the report as the money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to workers affected by collective redundancies .
One part of this policy must be based on the EU &apos;s ability to react to possible sudden crises in supply .
The aim of this assistance is to improve the living conditions of the beneficiary populations through the recommendation and provision of all the instruments to ensure that these countries take the path towards growth and responsibility .
Therefore , the solution is to do much better in the future , and the next opportunity is this year in Mexico .
That is a fact .
The blasphemy laws , which include the death penalty , are incompatible with the common values that we try to promote in our relations with Pakistan .
I supported the European Parliament resolution calling , in particular , on the Member States to take action to help curb the development of the disease in patients - by promoting healthy lifestyles and ensuring that the availability of medicines for all peace - to establish specialist centres and facilitate satisfactory medical equipment throughout the country and to draw up strategic action plans for research in this area .
There can be no stability without solidarity .
Since January , 23 000 immigrants have entered Italy .
Thanks to the Order of Malta , the Refugee Service and many Christian organisations , governments are recognising their obligation to address the fate of refugees .
The Stockholm Summit to be held next week will therefore focus on areas - as has rightly been said - where there is mutual interest , for example , energy , climate change and the global economic crisis .
Vice-President of the Commission . - In a world that moves quickly towards a new digital era , Europe must be prepared and have the most new broadband infrastructure , which will certainly be the one that dominates the growth of tomorrow .
Madam President , today we voted on the revision of the Green Paper on the future TEN-T policy .
As a member of the STOA expert group , a project aimed at more efficient management of natural resources , I consider it very important to compile a reliable statistical database .
Last but not least , I would like to talk about the relationship between international trade and climate change .
in writing . - This law proposes various measures , some of which could be useful for small businesses , but whose overall effect is to promote EU control , agendas , feminism and promote the infiltration of EU officials in companies with their &apos; practical work &apos; .
This exemption is being proposed in order to tackle a crisis that we can all see and which we have discussed many times .
The close link between public finances and the economic and financial crisis is very rigid .
Over the 15 years , the 189 countries that signed the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality have achieved quite a breakthrough in the 12 areas of competence identified in the document .
enlargement strategy 2009 concerning the countries of the western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All actors should seize the opportunities presented by the Geneva negotiations in good faith .
I understand that the figure presented as the amount of illicit trade entering the European Union in the form of cigarettes is EUR 9.5 billion , and 97 % of this amount is out of the art .
I also welcome the reference to project bonds &apos; initiative , which I consider to be a useful instrument for growth and development in a sector as strategic as infrastructure .
Bulgaria and Romania have met the requirements and I congratulate Mr Coelho on combining freedom of movement with citizens &apos; security in a balanced report adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are deciding what needs to be done in this area , but let us not forget that , in terms of financial aid , the fight against the crisis is the priority .
However , do you really think that this is what the small businesses and their workers in the European Union think ?
They came to Brussels to say to this Parliament that , if we adopt the legislation , as it is drafted , on alternative investments , then we would reduce the funding for the organisation in two thirds .
Key words will undoubtedly be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; consistency &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; simple &apos; .
There are , of course , other different ways to the crisis , but I am sure Commissioner Almunia will be prepared to discuss this issue with you on another occasion .
I am in favour of the report because forests covering more than 42 % of the EU area provide a livelihood for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector .
As you know , it is unfortunately up to the governments of the Member States to decide the headquarters of the institutions and , unfortunately , under the chairmanship of the former leader of their party , John Major , at the 1992 European Council , the European Parliament was forced to hold 12 part-sessions every year in Strasbourg .
The Committee considered that the medication containing benfluorex should not be the subject of an assessment at European level because of the different ways of action of their anxygen substances .
We have always maintained that there must be reconciliation dialogue and that dialogue must continue .
Firstly , an agreement needs to be reached on the broad lines of the EU 2020 strategy and the budget review presented by the new Commission so that the new College takes full responsibility for this proposal in order to work closely with Parliament on the future financial perspectives .
Given the lack of a European policy to support the maritime transport sector , production levels are unlikely to return to the current crisis .
There is no point in insisting on the development of the Lisbon Strategy when the economic and social crisis , which helped to generate the implementation of this strategy , is getting worse .
If we allow this status quo to continue , in 20 years &apos; time , there will be no longer any trail of freight rail freight .
Furthermore , I cannot fail to point out the extensive negotiating powers required by this proposal , especially by the rapporteur , Mr Rangel .
As the volcanic ash could stop engines from aeroplanes and could also prevent visibility through their windows , the European Organisation for the Security of Navegation Area , Eurocontrol , adopted a responsible approach and gave high priority to passenger safety .
It is therefore a package of legislative measures that reconcile health and the environment with competitiveness and innovation rather than face them , as is too often the case .
My view of the voluntary collection of articles by manufacturers is very critical .
The outcome of this analysis is expected to be reflected in the next Decent Work Report , which will be published in 2011 .
I recognise that this is not perfect and there are some concerns .
Apart from poverty , which unfortunately still persists , we are also concerned about global environmental problems such as climate change , and now we are essentially talking about a type of global insurance premium to compensate victims for the social and economic suffering caused by the financial catastrophe .
Finally , I would like to wish Commissioner Kov√°cs every success in his future endeavours .
However , we do not support the wording concerning an increase in agricultural aid through POSEI for EU producers affected by the agreement .
With these available functions , I believe that European diplomacy can play a more active and decisive role in defending the European Union &apos;s basic interests , which also cover energy security .
I would like to stress once again that the citizens of the European Union are watching with interest how we respond to the much-vaunted Treaty of Lisbon .
We , the June List , do not believe that a multiannual programme or a European Agency on linguistic diversity and learning languages at European level will make any difference to approximately 500 million EU inhabitants , except to burden taxpayers even further .
However , this legitimate issue has , in a sense , become , a kind of interinstitutional war that has been going on for years between the European Parliament and the Council , let us say , a kind of war that has been going on for years .
They should accept that one of the reasons why the Commission presents so many mistaken , poorly conceived , inadequate and poorly drafted proposals , which we in England and in other countries have to put up with , is a lack of transparency .
Whether he understands it !
However , little consolation will be given to those affected - the families who fill the death of one who are seriously injured or those who have been seriously injured - that we continue to emphasise that rail is the safest means of transport and that the number of accidents is very low compared to those on the roads .
However , we also call for the problem posed by the visa requirement , which is partly reintroduced by the Canadian Government for European citizens in the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania , to be resolved at the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit .
The European Parliament also has an important role to play .
It goes without saying that the new , stricter framework would have to be applied by the EU &apos;s neighbouring countries so far , of course , that we would once and for all manage to rid ourselves of the nightmare of nuclear power plants .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , under the terms of the Act on the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , I declare the first session of the European Parliament open after the elections .
I voted in favour of the report because economic stability can also lead to political stability in the area , which has been particularly disturbed in recent years .
It has also done so in underlining the importance of forming legal professions in order to cooperate and approximate our computers and , through mutual recognition and trust , to be able to integrate the response instruments in order to make the European Union a real area of freedom , justice and security .
Why is it so difficult to say that the same must happen in the Middle East ?
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , this debate comes at a very timely time for tourism , the air transport industry and consumer protection .
I therefore support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , which seek to strike the right balance between privacy and the safety of users on the Web , while fully respecting their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , this is a democracy ; in fact , we are discussing it and it is an attractive debate .
I am pleased that the European Parliament can finally enter the ECA and discuss the types of future guidelines to be adopted in this regard .
The EU must not wait until 2014 for its structural and regional funding to be more flexible ; it must do so now , so that the Roma can also benefit from it .
Similarly , they must be justified in legitimate interests : national security , public security , the prevention of disorders of criminal acts , the protection of health or morality , and so on .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I represent the High Representative and the Commission .
We must act quickly , not only with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistani - this will be discussed shortly , but also with regard to Iraq .
Finally , the ALDE Group is very disappointed that , on the eve of the summit , Russia has imposed a disproportionate veto on imports of vegetables from the EU .
It also shows that the burden of excessive regulation , which often bears the image of the EU , is not always the fault of some EU institutions , but of the Member State itself .
This draft language law jeopardises the use of minority languages in all aspects of life , which also affects , for example , the indigenous Hungarian minority formed by half a million people living there .
in writing . - ( DE ) The dairy sector is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis : production prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have risen and many EU farmers are struggling to survive .
in writing . - ( PT ) We welcome the rejection of the European Commission &apos;s proposal , chaired by Mr Dur√£o Barroso , who sought to exclude self-employed workers from the transport sector from the directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , thanks to our proposal to reject it .
In this context , distinguished European personalities , political parties , the public in their demonstrations and European trade unions raise a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and protecting the stability of the euro .
We must not now reduce this ambition .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we want to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers .
SMEs are the engine of the European economy and they produce sustainable growth , as they create numerous quality jobs .
Other factors , such as , for example , giving German proper importance as the working language , as laid down in the Treaties , have been ignored .
The more time has passed without an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the more the risk of a terrorist attack that could be prevented .
Mr President , this is a recurring debate in Parliament .
This also requires strengthening the education and investment in education , research and innovation sector as the cornerstones of a sustainable economy and takes greater account of the environment .
It is regrettable that the resolution has been issued much later than the statements made by certain UN Heads of State or officials on the deployment of tens of thousands of US troops in the country .
The costs and bureaucracy associated with the wrong policy of multilingualism will only be increased as the EU expands .
This has not been done .
All this may seem very distant , but if the valiant Burmese people can learn something from this Parliament in Europe , it is that tyranny can never extinguish the light of freedom and that this , which is their insurmountable right , will once again be their own one day .
What we need is to tackle this situation with solidarity with each other , with a coordinated approach , before one of the kind of &apos; every account for himself &apos; , and not try to cut off each other &apos;s rooms .
The Agenda will be accompanied by three documents on broadband : firstly , broadband communication , which explains the implementation of the agenda in connection with broadband ; secondly , the recommendation on access to new generation ( NGA ) , which aims to clarify the basics in order to encourage investment on the high-speed Internet ; and , thirdly , the first step in the radio spectrum policy , which will be generated by the Commission .
The aim of this directive is very clear : we need more organs for patients and increased cooperation between the Member States in particular and in combating illicit organ trafficking .
Sufficient has been done during the rescue process for banks to respond to this predictable development .
There are currently only a few production and employment nicks left in the average and high-gama segments , as well as that of luxury and high technology products .
Confidence is damaged when a government is subjecting its banks to a stress test in the summer and only a few months later realises that it was , in fact , a stress test for the euro , and not for the banks .
I very much welcome the adoption of this report which , in seeking to promote research and innovation , is the driving forces behind the current and future growth of the European Union , gives a voice to the common feelings of the people affected : the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of the projects while strengthening the process of scientific and technological evaluation .
Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that political parties and parliamentary groups that are against these demonstrations of populism and demagogy must raise their voice .
On the subject of emergency measures , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the increase in minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to 15 000 may lead to problems for Member States in a more difficult budgetary situation .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would like to ask you whether , in your conclusions , you could address some of these real problems so that the public realises that they are being discussed .
You have just mentioned five points , but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 means that economic , social and environmental issues are also being dealt with - is being lost , or at least we see that there is a risk that this will happen .
Let it be noted that these are not my words .
Consequently , the vast majority is currently in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon , including most of its people .
So we have to be careful about that .
We should fight this and support those who receive such punishment .
I am sorry , it is not possible .
I regard restrictive measures and sanctions as an important instrument in EU policy in the areas of foreign and security policy and , of course , in matters of justice and the defence of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , the cornerstone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to raise an important issue in this regard .
We supported this resolution with the clear aim of sending out the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are on the side of the people of Haiti in the long-term task of rebuilding the infrastructure , communities and lives that have been destroyed .
We are obviously determined to maintain our support for this type of action already taking place in the European Union , not only in the context of preventing violence and helping victims , but also in areas such as immigration , asylum and criminal law .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Many EU Member States are individually and collectively guilty when it comes to Guant√°namo because , for example , they granted rights which allowed them to overvote for illegal prisoners transport .
According to that programme , trade policy remains a very important tool for tackling the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and promoting economic growth , employment and prosperity for all European citizens .
Therefore , as far as we are concerned , we make it clear that we want the obstacles to be removed .
I would like to add one issue that concerns me : admission goods from outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , one realises , then , that behind many of the measures , there is a deliberate intention to hide the irresponsibility that we still have in our institutions , including the parliamentary term allocated in a very clear way .
I would like to add to this a number of significant political aspects because , as has already been said , Tunisia is a society that exercises a multiparty policy , albeit in a limited way , with an opposition quota , certainly , but in any case a multiparty policy .
We had a problem with the appointment of 18 additional Members for this House , because certain Member States did not actually plan a procedure , but we decided that representativity is the most important thing , which is the principle we should guide ourselves and that this House should have a balanced representation as soon as possible .
As has already been said here , the sensible use of soil , the economic and social development that is in harmony with the nature and strengthened cohesion in the EU are also vital factors in disaster prevention .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan , and I hope that we will achieve further progress in these relations .
The legal texts before us define not only the framework and lay down the fundamental guidelines , but the concrete and real steps to be taken still need to be taken .
Furthermore , I believe that we need to go beyond the proposal right now in terms of greater preponsibility of environmental issues in the internal market , for example through green procurement .
I refer to the importance of the amendment stressing how the issue of observers should be addressed , bearing in mind that these observers should be elected from among the main candidates , who were not elected in the elections to the European Parliament .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but today we have a more urgent problem : the euro area and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICT ) are an important sector , largely due to the weight of the European economy , since they represent 7 % of the workforce - labour in Europe - and they generate 6 % of GDP , that is to say a significant percentage of the European economy and also of Europe &apos;s workforce and productive force .
I think it is necessary to wait for a whole series of initiatives that will ask the Commission to do more , asking it to do more Europe , to put it another way , and the Commission will certainly respond to these things in an enthusiastic way .
If we do not accept our responsibility and if we do not adopt a clear position , then we can forget what Mrs Toia has said before : we have to be aware that by 2020 - and this date we set it in the Digital Agenda - all Europeans have to be able to pursue their interests through what are ultimately spectrum opportunities .
These organisations acquire their power on the basis of responding to people &apos;s everyday needs and consolidated them through terror .
Statements by the President
in writing . - I supported the radio spectrum policy programme ( PVER ) because I believe that all EU citizens need to have access to a quicker broadband connection by 2020 .
The consequences of unlimited exploitation of their natural resources would be catastrophic not only for the immediate environment and for the indigenous population , but for the world as a whole .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Gy≈ëri on her current term of office and wishing her and the Hungarian Presidency every success .
We must also move forward on the issue of nanomaterials , and now that the aspect of cloning has been removed , we can move forward quickly on that .
A fruitful partnership will be particularly important in areas such as financial services , economic governance , implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market .
With regard to emerging countries - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - it has to be said that they are also making national commitments that go beyond what the scientific community is asking them for .
The protocol provides for a financial contribution from the European Union to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe worth EUR 682 500 a year , of which EUR 227 500 will be earmarked for supporting S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe fishing policy , which I think is appropriate .
We will see how it is implemented in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament &apos;s efforts more seriously in this regard , although I am very saddened and concerned that your representative is no longer in the Chamber .
If we , as Europeans , have an active role to play in this regard , it is essential that we continue to do so .
This report is an additional step forward in putting pressure on the European Council , the Commission and the Member States only to take action to end street homelessness .
For example , in the event of expulsion , the family has to be able to choose between following the expelled family or to stay where it is .
This terrible agreement was signed to ferreers and ratified a month of August in the 1980s .
Negotiations with Japan , aimed at strengthening trade relations , cannot be used as a weapon at the service of large industries and financial companies , promoting the growing exploitation of workers and people , destroying their productive force and destroying the environment .
We confirm that we will be reporting on what we are obliged to do and , as has been promised in the IAI , on budgetary reform by the end of this year .
Between July and August , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in the east of Congo alone , more than 500 people , including girls , children and women aged up to 75 , have been victims of the gang-made rapes .
The initial draft report , therefore , where the construction of a House of European History is established with exorbitant operational costs , was totally opposed to my strong belief in the budget restriction when it comes to public money .
After all , these are investments that are not immediately profitable , but they are made for a reserve .
I would also like to emphasise whether it is politically possible for us to take a step forward , as my predecessor said in the speaking time , for third countries .
This Cross-border Healthcare Directive is essential , despite the fact that it only affects 1 % of national health budgets because , apart from figures , what we should be focusing on is the importance of symbol , which is the legitimate right of every European citizen to be treated outside his country and reimbursed for the treatment he receives with all the correct information .
However , as a form of primary prevention , I call for the implementation of measures promoting healthy lifestyles as a key factor in improving health .
In view of the different regulations of the Member States and the often limited ability to influence the provisions of international law with regard to combating violence , the need for clear and binding regulation at EU level in relation to this problem is made more evident .
What is your opinion on these unforeseen passive developments in the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including freedom of opinion and the freedom to receive or communicate information without interference or pressure , are social values for which many people have fought over the years , including in Portugal .
I think it is we that we can still save the planet .
In short , as we have said so many times , we need a strong , well-financed cohesion policy in all regions of the European Union .
In principle , I share some of these fears , and I also recognise that Turkmenistan still has a long way to go before it fully meets international standards on democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of companies relocate , taking advantage of lower labour costs in some countries , especially China and India , with damaging consequences for countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen - and I refer in particular to the members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - there is no point in us defending one or the other group in Ukraine for partisan reasons .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , my fellow Members , the first thing I would like to do is to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom we have a great deal of agreement on this programme , and congratulate us all , because in times of economic crisis , it is essential to maintain a programme like this , with clear social effects .
The Commission expects it to be able to develop a special relationship with Parliament when it comes to this as well .
Mr President , Commissioners , we must ensure that the promises of donations made at the donor conference will henceforth materialise in real funds , as well as actually reaching the recipients to whom they are destined .
This is the committee outlining the necessary citizen-centred policy , especially in the context of the crisis we are experiencing at the moment .
The European Council must make the necessary preparations , but it must not reach hasty conclusions .
If Portugal was not a week after week &apos;s closure of several companies , it would not be seeing so many Portuguese unemployed and living in poverty .
By setting up a fixed fund , as proposed by the Socialist Party , we would ensure that Member States that are attacked by unscrupulous speculators can be supported without directly resorting to taxpayers and can guarantee the minimum spread .
Of the new infringement cases recorded in 2007 , 1 196 referred to the lack of notification of national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives .
I believe that a balance needs to be struck between environmental protection , on the one hand , and bureaucracy and costs for industry and small facilities , such as farmers and health facilities , on the other .
The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of this strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating my friend Mrs Weber for her good work on this report .
I am pleased to see that Parliament and the Commission go hand-in-hand with many of the priorities we are talking about .
In fact , it leaves large monopolies with national and international road transport on a flag .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
If large-scale antibiotics are used , it is not surprising that there are kinds of bacteria that then do not respond to antibiotics .
This directive does not adopt the principle of protecting migrant workers and those who are forced to work in inadmissible conditions and denounce them .
I am very pleased that we rejected the project that was only on the agenda so that the left could attack their political opponents in Italy .
You are absolutely right .
It is true that there were heated discussions in the Council on the best way to ensure that the Member States on the periphery do not feel isolated , and finally a qualified majority was formed in the Council and I hope - and I think this has also been demonstrated - in Parliament .
Approval of Amendment 43 should not lead to the elimination of Amendment 54 , as 54 understands other matters than 43 does not cover .
Order of business
Climate change is not the only environmental problem facing us , but it is essential that we try to deal with it in Copenhagen .
However , no new body is required to provide such aid or to determine and monitor the conditions .
- ( HU ) I welcome the Council &apos;s decision on the position that we must defend at the G20 Summit .
We should examine whether we need new sources of revenue , in which case we must turn our eyes to those who have always benefited from this unspeakable situation .
in writing . - As a fervent opponent of the EU and its intrusion into our lives , I voted against the vast majority of reports that are subject to consideration .
This cost the job a million unnecessary British citizens .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is an instrument that the European Parliament is now increasingly using due to the difficult time of economic convergence that our continent is experiencing .
I demand that Judge Afiuni and all Venezuelan prisoners be treated with dignity and given them a very fair trial .
Some of you asked for Gaza , about assurances that the aid should continue to support the people who live there , but we are engaged in dialogue to increase and improve that support .
I voted in favour of this report also because it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fairer financing system for the European Union .
Although the European Union must maintain relations with the Russian Government , we must remind the government at all times that we are always demanding that democratic status and democratic culture prevail , and that attempts to censor opinions that are not acceptable to the government , or that politicians be put under unfair pressure , will not be accepted in the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , the giant European giant unfortunately did not join the giants of the United States , China , India and Brazil in Copenhagen .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that research and innovation are not an option for Europe but a necessity if we are to find a long-term solution that protects our social model and our environmental sustainability .
It is clear that the aim is to retain raw materials by trying to obtain more attractive exchange rates for their exports .
That is why .
Developing countries rightly claim that they did not cause this crisis .
With regard to these measures , the European Union must play its role by thinking about the possibility , at the right time and in the right way , of technical measures to complement UN sanctions and , at the same time , by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue , which must never be lost , even at difficult times .
As the current directive does not appear to be sufficiently effective in discouraging late payments , I also support the strengthening of the existing rules .
Since then , it has been clear to us , firstly , that the United States is much more receptive to these reservations and ready to find constructive solutions to European reserves than we had previously created .
Indeed , Commissioner Rehn said here that before they were allowed to hold general elections , they would have to agree on their budget .
I would like to comment on something that is quite curious : in the United States , the use of shield in coyuvants has been banned , but the European Medicines Agency has been authorised by the fact that most vaccines contain shields .
The European Union &apos;s most effective tool for combating unemployment is the European Social Fund , the rules of which have been considerably simplified to speed up payments .
I think we need to give time to make this package fit : to implement it and to see how it works before we decide whether something else is needed .
Further areas were added in order to improve cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of mercenary activities ; the fight against manufacturing , trade and the accumulation of small , small arms ; and cooperation on migration .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy .
The first is that , despite all the concern and fear felt by citizens , we must not lose sight of the principles .
The resolution explicitly mentions and criticises the measures introduced by the current government , but forgets that the current mayor of Naples , Mrs Iervolino , belongs to the centre-left and , worse still , forgets Mr Bassolino , who was a mayor of Naples between 1993 and 2000 and Campania &apos;s governor Governor of 2000 , and also , for many years , during the special waste .
Be it up and fight for democracy again .
Apart from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and the essential traceability - the first point - is also a question of knowing how this general alert that has been elected to Spanish cucumbers to put them under the fault has been broadcast without any , or almost any , proof , .
At this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report falls short , as it still sets too many conditions for prior approval and makes it difficult for the Member States .
The future of that region requires strong , tolerant democracies that respect minorities and in which the state is a promise for everyone and not a reduction in their use of a few to commit their abuses .
I sincerely hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011 , to create an economic growth area and to resolve economic difficulties .
Therefore , a resounding majority of stakeholders , including professional associations , are generally in line with the option &apos; only in English &apos; .
The only way forward for workers and workers is to follow is disobedience and insubordination with regard to the decisions made by the European Union and its institutions .
At the same time , political dialogue has been interrupted .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I propose an oral amendment to vote by paragraph 10 on the next passage : &apos; considers that the inclusion of this concept in the protocol on international standards on racism , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination &apos; is not appropriate .
We need to increase this objective and we will increase it , but only if the circumstances are adequate .
It is essential that we in the EU take action AHORA .
As far as financial services are concerned , I agree that it is necessary for service providers to apply a certain level of transparency , but I have some doubts about the wording used in the project .
The budget behind this report - which is made explicit in the first point of the preamble to the compromise of the proposal , when it accepts the finalisation of milk quotas - is unacceptable to us and that is why we voted against it .
Madam President , this is very good news .
We will spare no effort to clarify what is needed .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to point out that I cannot give my speech in Catalan as it is not yet an official language , although it is the language of more than 10 million European citizens .
The Union must modernise energy infrastructure and provide interconnections between the Member States &apos; energy infrastructure .
If Russia does not accept the political direction taken by Ukraine , it will have to overcome it , as it has overcome the loss of political influence over the countries of the former Soviet bloc .
In this regard , I would like to remind you of the decision adopted yesterday in plenary , in which we rejected a resolution on Aminatou Haidar in order not to compromise the ongoing diplomatic negotiations .
Mr President , we are talking about the situation in Belarus , but let us not go through the ball .
The main producer countries , supported by a majority of Members who are sensitive to industry &apos;s arguments , have managed to prevent us from setting an ambitious emission reduction target .
We have worked well together to unify what I think is a very powerful report which sets out a clear view of where this Parliament wants the CAP to be heading after 2013 .
The example of the United States indicates that flexibility is not synonymous with insecurity but rather a dynamic labour market .
As President of the European Commission , I will adhere to the principles set out in the resolution that we have just adopted .
We must now send out a clear message of responsibility to those who hold in their hands the future of this key treaty for the Union , for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans whom we represent .
These are all examples of the benefits of animal research .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work because , beyond the 146 million agreed , we hope that it will have an infplenty of times bigger multiplier effect , this initiative has significant symbolic value .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important path in deepening the ties between Europeans in a way that fully respects their various cultural and linguistic identities .
I think it is very important to promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale agriculture , organic farming and local distribution .
The special derogations were also allowed in rural areas and islands such as the Bodies Islands and Shetland in my own district , for example , where longer periods of journey are inevitable .
The policies implemented are challenging and disappointing our citizens and the decision-making procedures are discouraging their participation , as the last European elections have shown .
As regards the delay , the honourable Member is right , there has been some delay .
The resolution calls on the Commission to respond urgently to the legitimate concerns of the petitioner - who has been suffering this intolerable situation for 13 years with the resulting loss of income - and to take the necessary measures to enable the petitioner to assert his rights .
The way in which these objectives are achieved is to give full support , effective implementation and sufficient respect to existing laws and instruments relating to the protection of human rights and civil liberties .
Never before has the European project been subjected to such a test .
What are we going to do when the Americans , now that the dollar is falling , sell their 4x4 petrol speakers , the subject of intense subsidy and promotion , in our market , which is , moreover , being cut off by low gas vehicles in Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask you to make an assessment of the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place almost two weeks ago .
We call for common , European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out , if these points were to be clarified , the Commission would do well to consult the European Parliament when a mandate is issued .
It is very important that we as Europeans make sure that we also send the European message to Belarus , and that is why we give them an improvement perspective .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is more of the same , with a few democratic illucidity .
It is clear that these measures only provide a partial and incomplete solution to immigration and illegal work .
But do not call a hot : we are very clear : I am very clear to all the leaders with whom I am talking about what I think should happen , and I do so with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of all 27 Member States .
I am not exaggerating : one of these reports considers it necessary to establish that , in the case of a change of majority following elections , the new government must obtain authorisation before amending the budgetary priorities of its predecessor , but only when it comes to introducing marginal changes .
Worse still , while our political differences have , of course , remained the same , our human relationship has been considerably richer .
It is therefore important for us to make progress beyond the pilot project that you mentioned , Commissioner .
Essentially , nuclear power is established in such a way as to involve each country having a nuclear safety regulator that has full responsibility when implementing nuclear safety measures .
But the interesting thing is that , although several countries have problems due to the financial crisis , it is also true - as I think Mr Lamberts will recognise and appreciate - that in most countries that are taking a stable attitude to public finances , governments are not Socialists .
The possible scenarios are diverse , and they go from peaceful power by pro-democratic forces to the economic chaos and outbreak of armed conflict , and even the use of nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out .
In an ageing society such as ours , the number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer &apos;s or dementia will continue to increase .
On the subject of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the subject of changes to the European Social Fund , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation , because dialogue has been so constructive that the achievement of our objectives is possible at this meeting , and I consider it very important .
Would the Member States be encouraged to ask for assistance from the EGF to start implementing the measures that they have asked for to fund , at least to make sure that the workers do not have to wait for the Fund .
These strategies and programmes cannot be reduced to paper because if this were the only way to highlight the inconsistency and lack of confidence in the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
I cannot imagine who can wish to do a favour of this oppressive regime by supporting amendments offering Iran the opportunity to attack and weaken the opposition movement that has defended human rights and democracy in Iran .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of European contract law because I believe that Brussels should not legislate in areas where there is already national legislation .
Your election as President was linked to change and hope , not only in the United States but also in the rest of the world , including Europe .
To achieve this , I am in favour of the proposals put forward by the Commission to Parliament , many of which have already been mentioned in my report on the Community code with regard to the rules governing the movement of people across borders .
However , we oppose the wording of paragraph 8 , where provision is for a gradual and sensitive reduction in tax pressure on half-low wages and pensions , with tax reductions , lower rates and compensation for trawling tax .
In many cases , where a country &apos;s government has not participated in dialogue or in the programmes for improving the situation in question , country-specific resolutions are the only initiative that remains available to the international community in the face of these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not know the position of the new Parliament .
However , these exemptions should only be applied when it is possible to justify them on their importance with regard to security policy .
The Co-Chairs have also called on the LTTE to give up , but unfortunately this demand has been rejected , even ignored .
I agree with the possibility of calling for structural reforms in the countries with surpluses , but most of the care must be focused on poor countries .
I would therefore like to ask for a roll-call vote on the second part of paragraph 12 .
However , I am pleased that Parliament has shown such strong determination through this clear majority to resolve this problem in the way we have done it .
That is our European path , and it can differ from other roads .
The project , the European Monitoring Agency for the consumption of antimicrobial drugs ( ESVAC ) , was launched in the third quarter of 2009 .
Given the crucial role that research plays in economic development and job creation , it is important to avoid at all costs excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays that hinder the participation of the scientific community .
Although the banks have profits , they are applauded when they are known that they are , on a voluntary basis , making a small contribution to easing the situation in Greece .
This document shows that Member States are improving the transposition of EU law .
The best way to reduce population growth is to save the lives of small people , so there is no need for more children .
I therefore welcome the proposal to establish clear rules for defining these categories of wine based products , so that the high quality of European products can always be recognised and identified .
One initiative will only succeed if it can easily be implemented and is accessible to all .
In my opinion , particular attention must be paid to Corridor 7 .
We must therefore warmly welcome this communication , which places on record a new ambition regarding Single Market policies and enables us to regain confidence in our model of social market economy .
( The speaker agreed to take another Member &apos;s question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As you know , on Sunday , a second round of presidential elections took place in Ukraine .
The Hungarian authorities must effectively guarantee freedom and pluralism of the media , so they should withdraw the law or amend it substantially on the basis of the OSCE &apos;s remarks and proposals , the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe and the Council of Ministers , as well as the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights , and through open and transparent debate involving all stakeholders , NGOs and citizens .
The Pr√ºm Treaty was strongly inserted into European law without adequate democratic scrutiny .
I would also like to remind our liberal colleagues and , in particular , Mr Rohde , who was in favour of free trade for his devastating effects , as he maintained that the fact that British champion is guided by dishonest interests had few consequences : Indian society needed to be destroyed in order to cause world revolution to breast-feed .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya is acting against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human Rights and the People &apos;s Rights .
Firstly , civil protection is a matter for the Member States , and all coordination initiatives must be edited on this basis .
In 2008 , the UN Special Rapporteur for the extra-judicial executions wrote : &apos; All those deaths have been eliminated by civil society leaders , including defenders , trade unionists and supporters of agricultural reform , a large number of civil society actors have been intimidated and political discourse has been restricted in the country &apos; .
I do not agree with the previous speaker because I believe that , if we take the Treaty of Lisbon forward , we will have the opportunity to connect citizens to the EU much more significantly .
We are at the highest level of civilisation and armament , rather than the cold war , which has nothing to do with therefore pragmatic policies that move towards demilitarisation .
This will allow us to say that we are going to establish real and effective economic governance for the good of all Member States .
I think - and this is a positive message that I will take with me if the House follows our example tomorrow , for which I hope will be an equally large majority - that we have dashed that control , in fact , works .
We have also endeavoured to make it as clear as possible to our desire , not only for public stations with high quality and attractive content , but also for the integration of new platforms , taking into account modern technologies .
Madam President , two years ago , in December 2008 , we had a problem in Ireland .
Although miracles cannot be expected from this agreement , it represents a step in the right direction , which is why I voted in favour of the report .
Once again , it is an intergovernmental mechanism that was formed within the Ecofin and requires unanimity .
This runs counter to the ultimate aim of regional development : the strengthening of the weakest regions .
One symbol , one conclusion : towards that we should all work together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , the only way we will be able to give the scope required for our action is through clear commitment by the Libyan authorities .
Thus , we are already , of course , sending out a strong signal to the future renewed institutions : to Parliament , of course , but also to the Commission .
There is also a risk that real criminals will be adapted to the profile using the innocent people &apos;s aspect as drug traffickers or suicide terrorists or changing travel routes by others outside the guards .
Another fundamental element is greater access to schools , high level of academic and professional training , and an improvement in the social conditions of women in rural areas .
Despite that , other challenges remain .
EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in ACP countries and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
In my view , the most important point here is the need to agree on a new budget for Europe and the European Union for these years to come .
The EU must attach the utmost importance to research and innovation when faced with challenges such as climate change and find solutions for increasing global competition .
Europe is divided on this issue .
This is good news and we must thank everyone who , at state level , and sometimes at regional level , is responsible for implementing this directive .
According to the United Nations , 20 % to 40 % of world timber production is a result of illegal logging .
I know she is about to leave this place and , although we do not always agree with some issues , I think that everyone would agree that she has done a huge amount of work on this report .
This proposal , supported by the Council of Europe , has been waiting for it for a long time now for all those who have been fighting for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities , and especially Roma , to be respected .
Otherwise , any act that this Parliament did with a chamber of 754 MEPs , three above the 750 limit , would be illicit .
Not so long ago , however , we discussed the Digital Agenda ; we all agree with the Digital Agenda , and this is one of the main topics of the Digital Agenda .
I would like to thank you for making this debate a genuine joint debate .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with ICTY is a condition for EU membership , but the truth is that , as Commissioner Orban quite frankly said to me last night in the absence of Commissioner Rehn , there is no unanimity in the Council in what that means .
The Arctic Council has focused on environmental cooperation and research , but the agreements focusing on the use of natural resources have brought with it an increasing need to develop international administrative strategies , and here the EU may have a role to play .
However , I fully support a very strict approach to accessing the road transport operator .
When we open up our markets by acceding to the European Union , we start contributing the same amount of money to the budget and many other things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , there are no mechanisms or European institutions capable of coordinating an integrated continental recovery , and therefore we are reamending the problems with solutions that may inevitably fail , as the economies of the Member States have a high degree of independence .
Let me just say that , on our own communication , we are giving a clear definition of price stability that allows everyone to judge what we do in real time .
As far as the issue of judicial training is concerned , the Council agrees with Parliament &apos;s view to the need to promote a genuine judicial culture in the EU through , among other things , the promotion of direct exchanges between judges , prosecutors and members of the judicial bodies in the various Member States , and the development of the European Judicial Training Network .
We must make a common effort in this direction in the future .
However , this was not the case .
However , I would like to remind this House , and this is something that we have recently faced in Greece in important cases , that there are currently even criminal proceedings against individuals accused of serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union , which is to disappear or evadite and to avoid an order by resorting to the various procedural and different regulations in various national rights .
A general framework has also been created in which individual elements can be complemented and mutually strengthened .
Before the vote :
The most important message of today &apos;s debate for the Member States must be for Romania and Bulgaria to meet the same accession conditions as the European Union expected countries that currently belong to the Schengen area to meet .
The existence of a European contract law , which has been debated intensively in the institutions , could result in a wide range of benefits for businesses , consumers and the smooth functioning of the Internal Market .
It is politically unacceptable that this report , which contains incorrect facts , has been adopted today in plenary ( 24 November 2009 ) .
Indeed , we cannot , on the one hand , criticise the United States for years on the Guant√°namo centre and , on the other , not show much will or ambition on our part to help resolve this problem .
That is why we reject it .
The phenomenon of migration driven by the crisis and instability has negative repercussions for the country of origin , the destination country and the displaced populations .
Madam President , I do not know what has happened , but I would like to speak as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) .
For Serbia , people residing in Kosovo or Kosovar origin abroad and having a Serbian passport issued by a central authority in Belgrade will be excluded from liberalisation and they will be required to obtain a visa .
Passengers must be able to choose between receiving reimbursement at the price of the ticket or to continue their journey on the same terms and without any additional costs .
Ensuring that we have binding energy efficiency targets that can really be met .
I submitted this question on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism , as some Members are very concerned about the bankruptcy of the SkyEurope airline during the summer , and they came to my attention to take this initiative on their behalf .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
Firstly , we must eliminate the existing imbalances due to the growing difference between life expectancy and retirement age .
Proposals :
What is being discussed is whether we believe that we can finalise all the details , including the form of the agreement , in Mexico .
The OSCE is rapidly usurping the Council of Europe , which is the main and most important forum for debate on democracy - with its section of the ODIHR supporting the monitoring of buildings - human rights and the rule of law in Europe .
The compromise is a good one and I fully hope that it will receive broad support in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
Not long ago , I reminded Parliament that the elections in Belarus are not free , that freedom of expression , association and protest does not exist and that there has been an increase in the number of repressive activities led by the authorities .
A claim must be scientifically substantiated , taking into account all the available scientific data and putting the tests on the table .
Of course , this information is highly relevant to patients and health professionals , but it is liable to suffer abuse for advertising purposes , so it needs a strict framework .
Colleagues , ladies and gentlemen , repeated accidents and the growth in the transportation of hazardous goods by sea pose continuously acute problems concerning the need to develop stricter safety standards governing all closest across the European Union and to have the necessary resources to implement them .
The second topic is nuclear energy .
Then there will be the technical side , which means moving all this to a binding legal text .
So it is essential that the social clause is increasingly involved in bilateral agreements .
This is a good opportunity to prove this in practice .
Tuesday :
To increase this practical cooperation , the establishment of the Asylum Support Office was requested by the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum in 2008 and was agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009 .
We celebrated this week on 8 March .
Madam President , I am grateful to the honourable Member for this comment , but I would like to inform you that I am a representative of Poland and not a Lithuanian representative .
Mr President , I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs could be presented in plenary , after all ; this was not the case a few weeks ago .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Iratxe Garc√≠a P√©rez , Karin J√∂ns and Emmanouil Angelakas , who have submitted excellent reports , and all the Members who have spoken .
I know that you have been following these events very closely , as have our respective national parliaments in Europe .
We will therefore reiterate our call to Russia to make every effort to ensure that human rights defenders can work without having to live in the grip of violence , harassment or threats .
In addition , unnecessary complications could undermine the legitimacy and popularity of the EU accession process .
Opening of the sitting
I think we should stop pushing the Tunisian Government , which has many other issues to deal with : its own refugees - as has already been said - and monitoring its democratic transition process .
We must continue to formulate territorial , economic and social cohesion policies in order to reduce differences between regions and create a platform for balanced economic development , as also provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The vote will take place next .
Human rights groups have accused Google of helping the Chinese Government to repress its citizens and especially human rights activists .
The priority at the moment we find ourselves changing the directive quickly and making it possible to implement it as quickly as possible .
Faced with this situation , I propose , as I said earlier , the creation , along the lines of the EuroMed and EuroLat assemblies and with the participation of the European Parliament , of an Eastern Neighbourhood Assembly ( &apos; Euroeast &apos; ) , with a view to implementing the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in the countries of Eastern Europe .
The key issue we need to discuss is the financing of the European budget and future Financial Perspective .
We need to inform our citizens about the content of this directive and the media that we have made available through it , and we cannot allow them to fall into the trap of falsified medicines .
It is very important to create fair competition conditions for credit rating agencies by stimulating competition , transparency , market opening and stability .
At present , it is estimated that between 200 000 and 300 000 children are directly involved in armed conflicts in more than 20 countries worldwide .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an evaluation of the Copenhagen conference , while we say here that , according to many speakers , it ended up being a fiasco .
These improvements are crucial for promoting the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) in the future .
Commissioner , you mentioned the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the green economy , and you know that this European strategy is now a failure .
It does not want to continue paying export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , when it comes to a country , it is important to consider its origins and whether developments in the field of human rights and minorities are moving in the right direction .
It is also essential to encourage fishing companies by means of laws to use the best available equipment at present in terms of catch selection , so that they avoid the catching of huge volumes of fish that are lower than those of the species being sought , or of by-catches .
We will continue to insist on this .
As the Commissioner rightly said , for many years now , our main competitors and economic partners use origin marking in imported products .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday 20 May , at 12 : 00 .
While the EU supports the Copenhagen proposals to promote the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World , a growing majority of ordinary citizens regard climate change as an elites &apos; axis - an excuse for relief and monitoring us , and to impose internationalist dogma and a global government at the expense of nations .
We are also in constant contact with third countries , particularly with Russia , to ask them to lift their ban , which is deemed disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Hahn , the proposals that are now on the table mean putting a huge motto on the back of all those who are already in difficulty and telling you that they have to run it quicker .
Once again , I pay tribute to your courage and determination .
At the same time , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy that has worked so far in various Member States will obviously continue to shake the European Union for some years .
The first is that science is global discipline and that the progress that we can share contributes to the total sum of the human effort .
I would say : no more rules .
With its dex of popularity in free fall and following a set of measures of brutal severity , which have significantly affected quality of life , the Romanian Government resorts to increasingly violent anti-democratic methods to stay in power .
Let us remember the utopia , and the utopia for peace !
We believe that the European Union is moving in the right direction and we want to achieve the 20 % target through controls and greater transparency and ensure that nothing goes wrong in Europe .
I also proposed more funding opportunities for projects in this area , particularly in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the EU Public Health Programme and the Youth and Citizenship Programmes and the Lifelong Learning Programme .
Bearing in mind that the committee is made up only of seven Members and that its task involves a great deal of responsibility , it is important that these are people with an unreputable and highly competent reputation .
Even if we cannot give them the prospect of accession in the near future , we should develop economic and political cooperation for the sake of Europe &apos;s common good .
Following a public consultation last year , the Commission is evaluating comments on collective redress and trying to find a solution which meets the needs of European consumers without having to import US practices .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best working class is the one to listen to what they say in democratic votes .
I believe that this evening &apos;s debate has demonstrated an extraordinary overall consensus of Parliament regarding , for example , the EU &apos;s appointment of a special coordinator for Tibet .
I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities in the EU Member States just as the other EU citizens .
It is an example and a reference , and it is a lesson that is giving us the second poorest country on this planet : by entering the Court , we saw the motto &apos; There is no peace &apos; .
In this situation , cooperation between the Union and the Council is fundamental to ensuring energy requirements and preventing a rise in oil prices in the global market .
If we cannot provide a clear answer to these questions , the two objectives relating to growth in employment and the reduction in the level of poverty will be the same fate as the Lisbon Agenda .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said : &apos; I did not talk about this so as not to alter the Quality of the European institutions &apos; .
I hope that 2010 will be a good year for Croatia and also for the Western Balkans , but I would also like to stress the need to properly consider and address the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons .
I know it is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to add my voice to calls for this proposal to be withdrawn and for the Commission to present a new legal basis with a different legal basis .
There are many of the agreed revision clauses here to make sure that it works , but above all I echo what Mrs Wallis said : the exceptions were crucial for reaching the agreement .
Commission position is commendable : it gives the Member States responsible for safe management , including disposal , spent fuel and radioactive waste , through the development of their own programmes .
I consider this text to be yet another instrument for the EU , as it outlines a coherent and effective policy regarding the phenomenon of migratory flows , making its decisions follow the most appropriate path in order to recreate political , economic and social stability conditions .
Mr President , I thank you all and every one of you for your support and comments , and this includes , by the way , those who opposed the report .
Our third aim was to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for SMEs .
At the same time , Ukraine needs to speed up its reforms .
I would like to highlight the concern of the rapporteur , who reflects the concern of his group , for engaging with young people .
We are using our powers to defend these rights and freedoms in our work , in accordance with our treaties , and we will continue to do so .

Ladies and gentlemen , the proposal amending the Energy Renewings Directive is one of the most important measures adopted by Parliament , in terms of both increasing the quality of life of European citizens and promoting the EU &apos;s economic recovery .

The spectrum reserve for new entrants may be an appropriate instrument in some cases , but with a view to preventing unnecessary procedures ; then we would be close to their position .

The report recommends in particular : promoting education and training of health workers , as well as paramilic staff , with particular attention to nosocomial infections and to resistance to antibiotics by viruses that cause them ; making patients more aware of this problem , calling on the Commission to develop a document for patients on the basis of a manual for the prevention of World Health Organisation - Somalyphibiqual technologies in 2003 - the World Health Organisation .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is still a mystery how the Council can have handled such a subject as this with as this with as a rarity .
Although the EU budget is an important political instrument , the ceiling of own resources has remained invariated since 1993 .
As these islands depend on tourism , and tourism is declining , there is a growing threat of unemployment and a collapse of small and medium-sized enterprises , and this would also hit the people of these strands hard .
Some statements must therefore be put in prospect by means of amendments .
That is what a Norwegian doctor said to me , who operates every day and works ininterruptably ( we are sending doctors to Gaza ) .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , let me first of all add my congratulations to Jean Monnet .
We should not allow these tensions and this political crisis to continue .
The distribution of CAP resources among farmers in the European Union is a topic that is precise and central to the dialogue agenda .
However , I voted against the report because , although the overall framework is reasonable , some of the characteristics proposed by my fellow Member are unacceptable .

Your president , Mr Maystadt , held a conference two days ago , showing the amount spent by the EIB since the start of the crisis - about EUR 10 billion more than last year .

Mr Oettinger , you are currently drafting the Energy Roadmap by 2050 .
The rebates of those enjoyed by the British and who want the Dutch and Danish are a bankrupt system .
We will also have joint responses to economic challenges .
Closing our markets or controlling imports are not the right political responses .
With today &apos;s vote , Parliament has approved the mandate for the trialogue on the 2012 Draft Budget .
This report and the debate are valuable contributions and is welcome , but on another occasion , when we can discuss it further .

I would like the Commission to explain whether this aspect will be included in the amended version of the communication , and whether the responsibilities will be assigned appropriately , namely to the Member States , although they are accompanied by rules on services of general interest that should be drawn up prior consultation with the European Parliament and with the Council .
We should have set a sticking point , but we fail and now we must continue and seek success against all hope .
There are still no requests from the Chilean authorities , but they could certainly be put under both titles to reconstruction .
The hope is that the Commission and the Council will work consistently with one another on these guidelines and , above all , that they do so as a matter of urgency in which , regrettably and inexplicably , other , even recent cases have been lacking .
Ultimately , its intention is to criminalise Communists , their activities and their ideals .

I express , Mr President , my solidarity and fraternal affection for the people of Chile for the very demanding earthquakes and tsunami in Conception , Bio Bio Bio , Temucuco or Valpara√≠so .

In the end , fulfilment of these commitments will be essential for the gradual resumption of our budgetary support programmes .
I have received one motion for a resolution ( 1 ) in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Request for the opinion of the Court of Justice on compatibility with the Treaties of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco ( motion for a resolution tabled ) : see Minutes
That alone was a challenge .
You have clearly shown that we are unable to act for ourselves in times of crisis and to guarantee our people &apos;s prosperity .
In many ways , I admire the basic positions of my own group .
Participating such operations is a huge step forward , a big step in the right direction .
Could the Commission say to what extent will these sentences take into account , which demonstrate once again a lack of will for companies , too vague formulation of the &apos; extraordinary circumstances &apos; proves the cancellation of Regulation ( EC ) No 261 / 2004 , as well as the Commission &apos;s failure to comply with the countless cases of non-compliance with that regulation to the detriment of passengers ?
We all know that pressure is put on the freedom of the media in various Member States ( see the most recent report on the annual classification of freedom of the press , published yesterday by Reporters without Borders ) .

I endorse the measures proposed by the European Commission to help dairy farmers .
In my opinion , there is something that we could stop doing and it is ridiculing Greece .

That is why I voted for the report on the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions .
It is important to manage this issue , and the resolution of the European Parliament adopted today provides help in this regard .
The Commission will be based on the work of the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will collect and analyse the data and statistics on this matter .
In addition , these measures would harm the Union &apos;s foreign trade policy , by complicating the conclusion of free trade agreements , both bilateral and multilateral .

There will be a framework agreement and then we will have a rapid decision mechanism on the volume of aid .

These people often feel antipathy to others , feel displaced and afraid of censorship on the part of society .
Like many others , I remain concerned about the transfer of data en bloc and , of course , the monitoring of these data once it is in our hands .
- Report : Paulo Casaca
The way forward in this field is to improve its training , for example , by directing European funds more effectively towards policies for young people .
To be honest , I find it incredible that we have to adopt almost a line of defensive argument , because we cannot consider this issue solely based on the Euratom Treaty , but we must also consider the protection of consumers , protection of the population in the event of a major accident in a nuclear power station , on the basis of the European Treaty , so that we have complete control and we can intervene in the final outcome .
Finally , it links European energy security to close cooperation with NATO .
In this respect , we believe that the European Union should be much more demanding , and the European Commission much higher demanding , on those values that can lead us to a shared security and peace project .
In any case , the Commissioner can count on my commitment .
In November this year , all Member States must have established criminal sanctions for racist and xenophobic offences , as stipulated in the framework decision .
I would also like to call on Serbia to make a firm commitment as regards employment and social cohesion policies .
Financing land ownership needs to be considered in developing countries as an investment cost incurred as part of the EIB &apos;s external lending mandate .
The European Union can play an important role in this context , and has not only the right , but also an obligation to insist that high environmental standards are fully complied with , as I imagine that there are equally dangerous deposits and other Member States .
As I was also the rapporteur for the single report of a European institution on the subject of earthquakes , I know full well that much can and should be done at European level .
This brings me to the Commission as a whole .
Institutional cooperation must be fair , logical and democratic .
I think it was right , waiting in July , not to appoint and wait for the proposals that we are going to discuss now .
Mr Mavrommatis talked about a number of points that we have raised , but I think 70 years is the best representative of life .

The EU must not sit back ; the EU must do more to protect women and children , as well as the principle of the rule of law for everyone , in Egypt and in Libya .
I am pleased to report that the first steps have therefore been taken .
This is a plenary , ladies and gentlemen , so stop talking and councils the opportunity to continue with the one-minute speeches .
However , they must not be allowed to take those decisions that are the responsibility of all the Member States in the euro area .
We insist that assisting spouses be made mandatory , as is the case with self-employment workers .
Furthermore , given that the government had lost access to the financial markets , no support would have meant that fiscal policy had been even more restrictive than it was within the framework of the programme , and the restriction on expenditure would have been more severe .
As an example of these dogmas , I proposed to you the recent article by V√°clav Klaus that we were advised how to overcome the financial crisis through the temporary relaxation of our social , environmental and health standards , because , as he says , these standards hinder rational human behaviour .
As part of the ongoing discussions , it is important to establish clear guidelines and defend them , including on behalf of Austria .
Privates and professionals will have to take the bill off using one of many alternative but equally effective but insensitive chemicals , for example , through paint stripper / termal paint .
This time , following a long debate , Ireland , which is a small country like Finland , sought protection in the European Union and wants to contribute to strengthening the EU .
From the perspective of budgetary control , which , in modern terms , also covers real production and the performance of European programmes and institutions , the EIB has definitely gained its high assessment , particularly with regard to political formality .
This is a onerous task , but I am sure it will make every effort to achieve this .
I am not the only one you would like this to be clarified .
We also followed with concern the reports on the detention of several Tibetan students and teachers demonstrating peacefully against the government &apos;s education reform plan .
Taking into account the positions of the main players in this process , everyone will have to demonstrate a certain level of flexibility .
However , there are more important factors which could help patients have easier access to cross-border healthcare services in the future .
It is expected that he , on the other hand , will take recourse to a Vice-President of the country , which opens new speculation on the political scene in Nigeria .
Another important aspect is the development of alternative sources of funding .
It has been a real pleasure for me to work on this report , and I hope that you will follow individual reports on individual countries in the Western Balkans .
So I support the resolution , which calls on the Commission to include bee diseases within the scope of European veterinary policy and to draw up an action plan to combat bee mortality .
However , the beneficiaries are the people who are going to receive some ballot box .
What will happen for these five years ?
I am sorry but your speaking time is 30 seconds and the question of human rights in Cuba is addressed .
Despite the initial actions of President Yanukovych and the subsequent statements by the Ukrainian authorities on Ukraine &apos;s willingness to join the EU , adopting European good governance models and respecting the human rights and civil liberties of its citizens , caution is inevitable .
Today consumers have increasing access to counterfeit goods , whether on the back door or on the Internet , so we need to adopt a European approach to tackle this issue .
That is all .
Simplifying access to the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund is an essential part of the support given to the Member States most affected by the economic crisis we are experiencing .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has adopted on many occasions resolutions condemning cases of breaches of human rights and freedoms in different parts of the world .
As you know , the diplomatic debate on the Gaza conflict in the broader region has been very important : the indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended ; Mauritania and Qatar have broken their ties with Israel and the withdrawal of the Arab peace initiative has been under threat .
Firstly , we are talking about a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights , which is not an institution of the European Union , but is a court - a circle containing the European Union , but a different one - commitment to the rule of law , representative democracy and human rights .
We can help to boost the markets in new technologies , such as that of clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and draw up harmonised rules for the widespread introduction of new technologies in the market .

This situation leads to serious irritation both to hauliers and to Community companies .
Nor should the constant threat under which the children of Israel live should be allowed .
The new President of the European Council will fully exercise his duties from 1 January 2010 and has presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future .
So far , we still do not have a legislative initiative based on the Treaty of Lisbon , but we have been promised from the Commission a response to our expectations .
This instrument will facilitate economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation , thus bringing benefits both to the EU and its partners .
Climate change , as I have mentioned many times , is an urgent and serious issue , which requires objective and efficient instruments .
The European Union must now move forward and concentrate on the real task we are dealing , on making dynamic and competitive economies , on creating a solid global trade system and , specifically in the coming weeks , on achieving a really effective agreement on climate change .
At that time , a united and peaceful Europe , a European Parliament , must have seemed a fantasy to anybody living .
However , there are certain aspects of the adopted resolution that are less clear and others that have not been sufficiently developed .
However , I warn the next College of Commissioners - both the President and his Member States - that I and others in this House will be until the end of this , because we need to persuade and convince our producers to meet high standards .
But the main problem lies elsewhere : unless the political nature of the European project is clarified , we will be unable to tackle our problems .
I fully agree with the debate on territorial cohesion with the debate on the future of EU cohesion policy , since the latter &apos;s reform must incorporate the conclusions of the first .
If our Member States , aware of the budgetary constraints , can invest less in education , training , research and innovation , let us do so at European level , combining our resources and thus reaching economies of scale .
On this point , I call on my fellow Members to agree on an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution : in other words , not only deplore the situation , but also call on the Azerbaijani Government to cancel its decision and revoke FM licences to radio stations .
Let me repeat once again that the commitment of the Euro Plus Pact supplements all the other measures in the package to improve the economic results of the Member States , such as the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact on budgetary surveillance , the new macroeconomic surveillance and the implementation of the crucial Europe 2020 strategy in terms of structural reforms in order to achieve economic growth .

Before the vote on paragraph 16 :
A similar situation occurred in Baumgarten ( Austria ) .
If they are organised appropriately , they can really change .
There are two aspects worth highlighting .
I voted in favour of the report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security , as it puts forward important proposals on how the common agricultural policy to be implemented after 2013 should respond to the challenges of food security , climate change , the economic crisis and the maintenance of territorial balance within the EU , amongst other things .
Following the amendment to the Staff Regulations and the amendment to the Financial Regulation to include the establishment of the European External Action Service in such documents , it is now necessary to adopt a budget for its proper functioning .
( EL ) Mr President , the decision by the new President of the United States to close Guant√°namo Bay was one of its most important and positive measures , so I consider it to be very timely .

A series of acts involving jumping the Slovenian monuments , Slovenian schools &apos; walls and regional signals showing Slovenian names , have seriously broken Italian citizens &apos; feelings of slovenian and Slovenian children .
This may turn out to be the final renunciation to the German and French plans for standardising taxation in the EU .
Only subject C coming from the end product will the consumer pay VAT .

This type of system takes greater account of variants in the market and differences in the way in which each Member State thinks .
I have given you a little more time , Mrs Rapti , that a childbirth has always been somewhat longer .
In the face of such circumstances , if all MEPs want to act to defend what is known as the democratic values of the European Union , then we need to solemnly warn and , Commissioner , we need to enforce European law as you have rightly mentioned and say , together with the thousands of Italian intellectuals , publishers and journalists , which must be respected unconditionally in both Italy and in other countries of the European Union .
They have thus succeeded , through this depletion procedure , in putting an end to any provision designed to control the safety standards of ships or postponing them indefinitely .
The Swedish Presidency has faced the economic crisis and the financial turmoil with strong and realistic measures .
Finally , I consider it essential to guarantee the right to continue in the same job or to make an equivalent working position trials .
The Commission has a position to follow up on these matters .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group strongly and consistently supports the goal of joining the EU in all the countries of the Western Balkans .
But we are devoting all our attention to the Member States and very little to what lies behind it after certain market activity .
We will have to combine the leadership of the Environment Council in the negotiation and in the design of climate change policies with strengthened external action capacities .
I hope that the Member States , particularly Italy , will very quickly transpose the legislation .
If you want to take the floor under the catch-the-eye procedure , you will have the opportunity at the end of the debate .
The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country .
The next item is the report by Mr Karim , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I therefore believe that the conclusions of the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation - according to which the interests of the outermost regions should also be weighed up - are an important contribution , in that Parliament should give its consent to the agreements if the Commission and the Council are to submit to Parliament as soon as possible an assessment of the impact on developing countries and on the outermost regions of banana producers &apos; countries ; and to strengthen the ACP production position ;
The key factor in achieving this is the fact that developed countries want to open up their markets to developing countries , including India .
I am very grateful that Mr David and others have succeeded in bringing together a package that has received the support of a large majority in Commission .
There must be a 2020 target : all young people must be employed .
The different development rates and the increasing inequality in opportunities and the distribution of resources in geographical , social and generational terms , the rise in climate change ( in which human beings have a share of guilt ) and the associated increase in natural disasters , the rise in environmental pollution , the ancillary pressure concentrated on large urban areas and the unequal growth in the population in some areas of the world , leading the number of basic human dignity and an essential humanitarian conditions .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , from the outset , I would like to thank all my fellow Members for the work we have done together on this subject , which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position , to submit an oral question and to draft a resolution to accompany voluntary partnership agreements .
The European Economic Recovery Plan presented by the Commission in November 2008 and approved by the Council relates to the solution of urgent problems and calls for long-term investments to generate long-term benefits for the Union as a whole .

School education programmes on sexual and reproductive rights are fundamental to preventing HIV / AIDS .
Ukraine needs to take immediate action on both fronts , no matter how difficult it might appear at the moment .
It is very important to raise awareness of prescription medicines in order to prevent excessive consumption as a result of commercial considerations .
Ukraine is a European state and shares all the cultural values of Europe .
This law is therefore totally contrary to European values , as provided for in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The creation of a common legal framework is absolutely necessary to favour and speed up the development of these infrastructures .
The President replied that it was internal affairs and that the European Union cannot interfere in internal affairs .
The EU must take a stronger position on this issue .
For there to be a possible deficit in the substance is a matter for the fund and its subscribers , not for the European taxpayer .
The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that the premium is paid only in Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia , as we know , where there are no such spectacles .
I am going to refer to a statement by Mrs Doyle .
All this requires conviction , time and , above all , the political courage , which we lack .
In the proposal put forward by the Commission 10 days ago or less , it is an optional measure ; in other words , rather than creating a single market , the Commission destroys it .
For these two reasons , I believe that we must be very careful , but not so with the origin of the money , but with its destiny .
Firstly , we must give Vice-President Tajani credit for having given a very strong impetus to the new European tourism policy , established by the Treaty of Lisbon , with the communication adopted last June and the associated implementation plan presented a few weeks ago .
I am also in favour of &apos; more &apos; budget aid &apos; , both if it is general and targeted for a sector , and I support a smaller number of projects , if the macroeconomic and governance criteria allow it .
Finally , I would like to say that 200 years ago , Darwin published her book on the origin of species .
I believe that , thanks to the persistence of the Swedish Presidency , we will achieve success at the Copenhagen Summit .
However , I believe that the measures already adopted with regard to the identification of sheep are very good overall .

The main objective of the Commission &apos;s competition policy is to enable the companies involved to benefit from a security zone by adopting block exemption regulations designed to ensure proper market supervision .
Madam President , the Spring Summit is supposed to be the energy summit .
Citizens expect the law to be applied to everyone equally .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s view that these upgrades to EU-Egypt free trade agreements can contribute to economic and political stability in this key region in consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report seeks to contribute to a new Energy Action Plan , within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy .
And what is Mrs ≈¢icƒÉu &apos;s question ?
Europe must commit itself more to achieving the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , at least 0.7 % of GDP to the fight against poverty in developing countries by 2015 .
I would like to stress that both reports focus particularly on the partnership principle .
It is a clear contradiction to mention the Copenhagen criteria , mention another type of legislation and , at the same time , when perhaps it is not in the interest or perhaps it is not bold enough , to listen to the lack of competition so as not - let us say - to advance the protection of minorities because , in the end , we are faced with etern .
Many of these irregularities have been detected or reported late , jeopardising the protection and proper use of taxpayers &apos; money .
It is only fair to congratulate the Swedish Presidency of the EU and the Commission on their work on activating the Community Civil Protection Mechanism .
I would like to call on the European Commission to take the necessary measures in order to step up the inspections , which represent an inseparable part of European Union policy with regard to consumer safety protection .
Free !
We Swedish Social Democrats voted today in favour of the draft EU budget for 2011 .
Farmers have no contact with the end consumer , they are dealing with processors , who always have the option of importing .
Nobody is never entirely satisfied , but I consider the appointment of both representatives to be positive , as a balance has been found between the interests of all : among those of the small countries and those of the large countries , between men and women and between those of different political posts .
Mr President , contemporary terrorism is dominated by Islamic terrorism .
All those involved can and must learn lessons to prevent such cases from occurring again .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds may be a blessing , but they can also be a curse .
Therefore , much attention is paid in this European Parliament resolution to creating new jobs and combating social isolation .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think one point on which we all agree and which we have set out is that this programme of harmonisation of frequencies and coordinated use of radio spectrum may have a dual objective .
The reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world , and there are currently four million Iraqi refugees and displaced people , and it is clear that these refugees are the result of wars in which our countries have influenced .
I would like to ask you , Madam President , to draft a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency and to the next Swedish Presidency to open a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible .
Faced with this reality , the European voice needs to be felt by calling for us to maintain commitments made in official development aid ; by asking for new sources of additional resources to help these countries ; by calling for the burden and fees for migrants to be relieved ; and by demanding that no less protectionist temptations be applied and to support the conduct of a Doha Round of development ; by demanding the fight against tax havens and tax evasion ; and also by working a debt ; and also poorer countries .
There are those who say that origin marking will be expensive , but many products already with origin marking on the market so the additional costs would be minimal .
There is no sign that the restrictions included in the report will somehow influence or restrict Member States in issuing passports .
I fully share the rapporteur &apos;s view .
I would like to thank the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality for the hard work they have done to achieve this success .
Foreign companies pay nothing to use our roads , but the UK diesel tariff is 23 times more expensive per litre , which gives competitors a 15 % advantage .
Therefore , the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to create an EU Operational Headquarters could serve precisely this objective by supplementing NATO &apos;s current command structures in the field of joint civil and military operations .
However , we should not forget the jobs that are affected by the decision put to the discussion today .
in writing . - The new regulation adopted by the European Parliament today will give real impetus to consumer rights throughout Europe .
The human rights movement was positioned , from the outset , first and foremost as a movement to overcome Stalinism in public , political and cultural life in the country .
At the same time , I would like to stress that we have rendered accounts , and that this is taxpayers &apos; money .
Yesterday , in Madrid , we had a meeting with the Commission .
If we do this , we will be helping - what is the least - to spread the Decent Work Programme to the world .
I and my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , are deeply concerned about the weakness of its content and the way it has been drawn up .
The Financial Regulation guarantees a solid monitoring system and maintains the EEAS closely linked to the Commission .
I have voluntarily offered to replace Mr Stavros in this very important debate .
A potential and very important source for the Central European and Baltic States would be the use of emission credits accumulated under the emissions trading system of the Kyoto Protocol , thus making the benefit of the climate resources of these countries .
Thank you .
I support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and the approach adopted in the Commission communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea that it is necessary to organise the Single Market Forum every year .
However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council is challenging Parliament &apos;s new codecision powers with regard to the adoption of long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
- Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that , after four years , we have not yet seen any proposal coming from the Commission as to how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport .
This report is the result of a compromise since nothing less than 1 625 amendments on it and it splits into a number of key points covering the causes of the crisis , from the property bubble to uncertain banking products , the lack of European tax harmonisation and the fact that you do not know the Stability and Growth Pact .
Despite the difficult situation , these measures will allow a regular cash flow to be maintained to ensure that payments can be made to beneficiaries as these programmes are implemented .
I am firmly convinced that Member States &apos; tax authorities need to cooperate in order to reduce tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , Minister of the Pakistani Government , Salman Taseer , Governor of the Province of the Punjab ; or Sabir Jamaldini , the coordinator of the Human Rights Committee in Pakistan , have become innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law .
I would like to use one language that also reflects what is positive in relation to the European Union , because as surprisingly , there are also positive things that have recently happened .
It is an important measure which supports families with children and allows them to reduce the unfair tax burden they are subjected to .
We must warmly welcome them , not with mezquina mentality .
in writing . - ( LV ) These days , European farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together so that the livestock sector can develop and generate sufficient incomes for farmers .
There is a voluntary ambiguity , and once again the EU has turned its sleeves around .
We are now being proposed changes to a Treaty that would last a generation , with a simplified process , as requested by the EU powers , in order to create a mechanism that they consider to be &apos; fully consistent with the policies of the IMF &apos; .
Work in self-employment is of great importance to women because it can be a great help in preventing unemployment or in better reconciling work and family life .
in writing . - It is extremely important for the EU to take action and to become a world leader in reducing carbon emissions with the arrival of the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also important to make it possible for women to participate in the reconstruction of their countries after the war .
This will allow candidates from all the member countries of the IMF to compete on the basis of their merits , taking into account all the relevant aspects .
Without this assistance , Ukraine would be unable to continue to integrate itself fully into many areas of the economy and implement its other objectives .
Due , above all , to the efforts of the European Parliament , all the funds that are sold in the European Union will effectively be subject to the same rules .
in writing . - ( HU ) In a semester , the European Union has moved from a hopeful situation to almost complete disunity .
This would prevent companies , whose products have already been certified in one country , from having to pass through the entire certification process in another .
We are convinced that it is extremely important to work with India to achieve a successful conclusion to the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will enable both parties - the European Union and India - to benefit from it .
Antibiotics subsistence ( debate )
Mrs Takkula &apos;s report points to a significant social problem .
in writing . - The importance of consumer confidence has become clearer as a result of many recent events and this confidence is partly that there are adequate consumer protection laws .
I wonder whether Mrs Ashton can confirm this and conduct an analysis of the situation .
The Muslim Brotherhood is openly promoting this programme and is being given 20 % voting intentions .
Of course , we have the Europe 2020 strategy , where sustainability is a planning objective .
( The sitting was suspended at 13.45 and resumed at 15 : 00 )
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what has happened in the Committee of the Regions has been a serious and damaging violation of the rights of an EU Member State .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am staggered by the debate by my fellow Members who , on the one hand , talk about simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises , but who , in adopting the first step for micro-entities - which is what we are talking about today , not just from one side - are already inclined to say that no again .
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism that helps to manage this waste so that it ceases to be hazardous , as well as the adoption of regulators that are higher and prevent this directive from being breached .
Our objective should be to change renewable energy completely by 2050 .
We need an absolutely appropriate application of existing regulations and I think their comments about shipping , etc . , are useful in this debate .
In the rest of the document , however , there are Jewish references to Europe &apos;s ageing population .
I believe that as Parliament , it is our duty to make more dynamic decisions in reacting to the problems that appear in Europe , while recalling the need for transparency in our management of funds .
It is also an unacceptable and totally absurd situation for MEPs , behind closed doors , to have to ask the Commission about the content of the agreements that we are supposed to vote on .
I would also like to highlight the positive interaction between public and private actions , both to encourage victim compensation and to establish the five-year period for the exercise of action .
I join the rapporteur in the positive assessment that he made efforts to consolidate the management of financial and human resources , as well as the improvement in the functionality and effectiveness of the internal control functions achieved in 2008 .
We can normally value Russia &apos;s sincerity through its degree of commitment to conflict resolution such as this one , but the fact is that in that region , as well as in Georgia and Ukraine , Russia cannot resist interference .
I welcome the adoption today of my colleague J√°uregui &apos;s report on EU accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
in writing . - Parliament has today voted in favour of a change to the legal basis of legislation on radioactive contamination of foodstuffs .
I therefore agree that we must call on the Member States to take measures to improve the situation of children abandoned by their parents in the country of origin and to ensure their normal development in terms of education and social life .
The Campania region and , in general , the Italian state is working on the creation of a waste disposal facility network , in accordance with EU law .
All this will make the market more competitive and safer .
I call on the President of Parliament to intervene in full in order to obtain an answer to this attack .
In the Europe with which we dream , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
( DE ) Mr President , in all the countries that are experiencing a crisis , there have been real problems .
We urge the Council to stop turning this House into a laughing stock and the Council should stop making itself laughing .
That is why I and my group support this directive , which represents a very important step forward by Parliament - a move that will have a beneficial effect on the European population .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on consumer rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me first thank the shadow rapporteurs , particularly Mr S√°nchez Presedo , on behalf of the Socialists and Mrs Bowles , who have worked so effectively with me on the compromise text presented today as report on the Commission White Paper .
- ( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the extent to the interest in this debate by the authors of the question may be due to the fact that none of them are already in this Chamber , and therefore they will not have heard what Inese Vaidere has just said : that the Russian visa policy has been a weapon used not to promote the process of nationalisation in Latvia , but to achieve precisely the opposite .
However , in my opinion , the work achieved invites optimism .
In my opinion , the EU should adequately assess this option during the forthcoming dialogue organised by the High Representative .
( DE ) Mr President , the debate reflects the unresolved issues of economic policy in Europe .
Furthermore , the Commission &apos;s monitoring strategy for the research is aimed at providing reasonable safeguards on the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis throughout the framework programme .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
What we see is an attempt to manipulate EU trade policy - which the UK is , unfortunately , subject to at the moment - in order to implement a constantly rejected socialist agenda .
For us , it is important to stress that illegal employment will not be tolerated any further .
Media broadcasters are among the most important sources of information available to EU Member States and , as such , they represent an important factor in shaping the values and opinions of the population .
Nobody can understand this .
If some do not wish to go home , they can ask their jailers for political asylum .
If this is not diverted towards homophobia sponsored by a state and criminalisation of the public expression of our gay and lesbian citizens , what is then ?
Not only will entrepreneurs benefit individually , as the European market will also be more competitive compared to other large economies such as the United States , China or Japan .
It is impossible to exclude , prevent or envisage everything that can happen in aviation .
There have also been improvements in this area .
In so doing , it is implementing the conclusions of the European Council in March 2010 , which stressed the need to reduce the school drop-out rate in Europe and which also set a collective target to leave it below 10 % by 2020 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , millions of children a year are trafficked by children and even more are the victims of kidnapping .
Good governance at EU regional policy level (
We must remember that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability , for example .
This kind of collaboration makes things much easier for any rapporteur .
Thus , from a political point of view , it is absolutely unjustifiable that we vote on this text and this change of opinion of Mrs Wallis ( and also of part of the House ) in view of the debates that we have had .
Furthermore , this view has the support both of the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss High Institute of Law and of Mrs Schaldemose &apos;s report of 2009 approved by Parliament .
( NL ) I will start by thanking Mr Bowis for his efforts full of energy and dedication in the interests of public health and patient mobility , and I would like to wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems European aviation has experienced in recent days demonstrate once again the important role of passenger and freight transport in organising current society .
We have done so , secondly , and above all , because they are using the attention that they would normally give victims to create a new impact on immigration : social and legal assistance , automatic residence card , access to the labour market , simplified access to family reunification and social welfare .
Furthermore , they have revealed their opposition to some policies , such as those aimed at reducing taxes , in a message to governments .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package we are going to vote on tomorrow would not have been possible if it had not been for Parliament &apos;s determination , so I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the whole job that has been done .
Unfortunately , however , he can no longer be trusted as a reference in the political debate because he does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion .
I think that is something that the G20 should address .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effectiveness of European agencies related to employment , working conditions and training .
The fact is , too often , that the noble cause of human rights has plunged into a sludauzal , with thousands of lawyers making in defence of the false rights of terrorists , criminals and hardships .
The European Parliament is today demanding the immediate release of Dawit Isaak and the other journalists imprisoned in Eritrea .
Let me take this opportunity , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , to thank you for the addition of EUR 10 million which Parliament has approved at the end of 2008 for the European Refugee Fund .
At present , patients are tending to seek information relating to health so that they can actively participate in their health decisions .
They feel disillusioned and alarmed by the possibility that they will be excluded from the labour market .
If paragraph 1 does not have paragraph 1 , the rest does not make sense , and paragraph 1 , in which we call for a stronger and more sustainable CAP with a financial envelope equal to the ambitious objectives , will not make sense either .
the report by Mr Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on how to provide a Single Market for consumers and citizens ,
Realistic benchmarks need to be set for increasing employment , especially among young people .
I think we have a positive aspect : we are all interested in research and we know that it is the only hope of Europe and the Member States .
I would like to say that it was wrong for the Presidency not to unequivocally condemn the article published in the Swedish newspaper .
Measures are imposed on late payment of commercial transactions in order to protect the good health of the European economy , avoiding situations of financial suffixy from productive structures and overburdening financial products , thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector .
It is absurd to encourage the import of goods that do not even meet the quality criteria that our farmers require .
To conclude , we have before us enormous challenges in ensuring unity at European level , in order to engage strategically with the main external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate measures , but we still have a great deal to learn from the COP 15 .
The programme must therefore be based on real problems , put forward relevant questions and concentrate on concrete measures that provide added value to people &apos;s everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
Once again , I would like to thank you very much for this very constructive attitude .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment aimed , to a certain extent , at protecting bees , which is essential for farmers and food producers .
Thus , we can encourage users to choose , in the long term , by cleaner vehicles or means of transport , to use less managed infrastructure or to travel in different time .
We are concerned about the attitude of Iran and the worsening of the situation in Afghanistan .
I think it is important that we negotiate with the aim that the best solution to this problem is a solution involving everyone &apos;s common commitment .
We need to know which Member States have a high level and what is low level .
On the other hand , other states have decided , for reasons that seem to be of their lack of interest in applicants , to take advantage of the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are still outside the Schengen area in order to try , once again , leave them on their sidelines .
I am very pleased that agreement has been reached on this text to allow slots to be frozen during the summer season .
It is therefore necessary to analyse , for example , what happened in Detroit in order to try and prevent mistakes , but we must not act compulsively behind every attack , because this would probably lead us to take action which , in some cases , would simply not make sense .
Finally , all mothers working in a full-time manner have to be recognised for the purposes of retirement pension .
Any ill-intentioned and unfounded political attack will be redundant .
In this respect , Europe &apos;s approach could be to say &apos; yes , of course we need external supply , we need security of supply and ambitious , innovative projects such as Desertec , but we must also ensure that citizens , businesses and companies as well as individual households can have greater control over their energy budgets and their consumption in terms of price , economy and the environment &apos; .
For all these reasons , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) supports the proposals calling for an impact assessment and will vote in favour of Mr Sturdy &apos;s amendments , which I myself signed , concerning endocrine disrupters , and those that facilitate the availability of plant protection products in the event of an emergency .
It is outrageous that it is always countries that have the most to make every effort once again to pay for the mistakes of others .
Europe has been heavily engaged in the region for some time : EUR 1 billion a year in Afghanistan , EUR 300 million in Pakistan , the EUPOL mission , which is doing an invaluable job despite its problems of employing staff , the International Monitoring Mission and , of course , the individual states &apos; commitment to the ISAF mission .
This is one of the things .
Another necessary measure is for India to draw up and implement some clear , transparent regulations on public procurement , which will also allow European companies to access them .
In this way , with an impact assessment study and the formulation of different legal alternatives , together with a clear definition of the European infrastructure objectives and funding , it will be easier to achieve long-term strategic projects in order to build a stronger EU .
Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty , which is still pending in the US Congress .
It is becoming increasingly mobile and , according to the latest analyses of threats , organised crime is increasingly occurring in cyberspace .
I also believe that , as has already been mentioned , we have clarified in which areas the critical aspects lie , particularly in group supervision .
I am committed to working together with this President of the European Council because such cooperation will make a difference .
One positive remark , however , is that the report provides for the creation of an immigration liaison officers &apos; network to be sent to consular authorities , with responsibility for preventing illegal immigration and facilitating the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
Thus , people could say skilfully that the Brandenburgh Gate had become the door to freedom .
Firstly , the communication identifies how good governance of the fiscal sphere could be improved in the European Union so as to strengthen the interests of other jurisdictions in order to continue .
At the beginning of my speech , I mentioned the existence of a harsh dilemma , and the Commission knows the path it wants to take .
However , it is clear that if the two main parties in the country persist in their staestudity , this objective will never be achieved .
In my opinion , their contribution is now more crucial than ever , given that the current context is forcing the Member States to take difficult decisions - a situation in which I consider it essential to safeguard research and innovation as an investment in future - and I assure them that I will inform the Council of the content of these discussions and make them fully available .
We should be sufficiently humble to recognise the rights of democracy and parliamentary supremacy of all 27 Member States .
I also believe that we must implement a zero-tolerance policy in the area of human rights and democratisation and that we must demand significantly high standards .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation marks a step forward in terms of progressive approximation to the CO2 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe .
We can see that this transport strategy is at the forefront of Europe &apos;s major strategic developments .
The groups most exposed to unethical practices , such as children , young people and older people , should be subject to special protection .
In spite of these remarks , I receive the microcredit service in Poland with open arms .
It is in the hands of the Egyptian authorities to take urgent action to put an end to torture , investigate all cases of abuse against peaceful demonstrators and end the trials of civilians before military courts .
There are even cases where various national systems coexist in one country .
The answer is to be more democratic and not more extreme right-wing policies , hostility towards people and cynical contempt for people .
It is very na√Øve to put hope that a database covering the entire EU , with all its languages and computer systems , when they failed to produce a database for the health service and overthrew billions of dollars .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; with the aim of revitalising the Single Market .
Once again , for the sake of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must now design a transparent dispute resolution mechanism that is accessible to all investors , including smaller investors ( SMEs , for example ) .
This proposal for a European tax is anti-constitutional .
We need a plan B , as has rightly been said , and the railways are the alternative .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for the additional EUR 3 million of the 2008 EU budget aimed at rebuilding cultural heritage in the areas of the Western Balkans affected by war .
Furthermore , the Member States are obliged to ensure that no removals are carried out in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which requires the Member States to ensure that a person will not be returned to their country if he can be persecuted or subjected to serious attacks on his return .
This way they could be more effective than they would choose an exclusion and allow the various funds to function separately .
When legislating in the EU , it is essential to be aware of the extreme vulnerability of women and children victims of domestic violence .
I hope that , after the 26 elected assemblies have taken a decision , the administration will not parallel the democratic process by delaying its signatures .
2010 progress report on Iceland
There are also significant differences in terms of the rate of sentences for cases of violence against women in the various Member States .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
For me , the key issue is awareness and I think these reports will help to achieve it .
The next item is the vote .
It is important to understand that we are at a time of transition from an intergovernmental approach to a Community approach and I am pleased with the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs .
We must not forget , however , that the first is the good of the child .
Instead of completely removing micro-entities from the fourth directive , it is clearly necessary to determine and establish within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives a smaller need for regulation .
When such an escalation in the armed hostilities that there is no longer any security for international institutions , the situation is extremely serious .
This report contains the following proposals : to improve the collection of information at local and regional level , to better inform patients , to increase the number of nurses specialised in the control of infections , to encourage the education and training of health professionals and to attach greater importance to intra-hospital infections .
Well , Ireland decided to have a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative of the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , to call on the European Union to officially recognise the genocide committed by the Nazi regime and its allies against the Roma during the Second World War , as it is a step forward in the fight for the rights of the largest ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , it is not the first time that our fellow Member , Mr Cohn-Bendit , who gave the dictator in the style of Ch√°vez to a President - a prime minister - has not respected democracy .
The Tobin tax is a proposed model on financial transactions .
A large proportion of the Roma in Europe continue to suffer extreme poverty , discrimination and marginalisation , so it is time to improve their status .
It is society &apos;s duty to guarantee this freedom of choice and not to discriminate against any activity carried out outside the formal labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in the field of accounting and auditing , I have never seen a auditor auditing on how to do his own job .
It is good that Parliament is paying greater attention to the implementation and transposition of the legislation that we adopted here .
I am thinking of the elimination of taxes on textile products coming from Pakistan , which would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Lombardy and the rest of Europe .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
All radical changes in rural areas represent challenges in terms of population , employment , services and the environment .
It is therefore vital that we strengthen and develop concrete and concerted cooperation at the same time as we adapt it to the new difficulties in international relations .
I expect balanced commitments from Copenhagen , short- and medium-term commitments and verifiable commitments , together with one-way sanctions in case of non-compliance .
The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) therefore voted against this proposal and wants it to be responsible for the costs of all unjust losses .
I raise these questions because , while I am pleased with the solidarity measures adopted on 11 February , I have serious doubts that we Europeans really have the situation under control .
You will be told that there was once that Europe was divided ; there was a great wall in half , and the people in this very poor age and there was no democracy , and they lived under a badly known Communism which killed millions of people among their own people .
I would remind you that the Polish Parliament approved the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in April this year , but the ratification documents still have to be signed by the President .
I agree with your assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal and I would like to make a few comments on the importance of these activities .
The next item is the joint debate on :
The most important thing is for negotiations to be initiated and Parliament to prepare for this .
We believe that the accusations to these people are unfounded and I can assure you that we will continue to engage with the Iranian authorities until these issues are resolved satisfactorily ; in other words , until the people in question are cleared up .
The Jobbik party wants to put an end to the economic monopoly of multinationals and return Europe to small owners and family businesses , to eliminate unemployment within the European Community with their help .

One , let us move in the direction of a common immigration policy ; two , a much better arrangement for legal immigration ; three , an improvement in integration procedures ; four , a strong fight for irregular immigration or clandestine immigration ; a much better five-year Frontex ; six , an improvement in the procedures , conventions and agreements with countries of origin and transit ; seven , progress on a common asylum policy .
With the Irish &apos; yes &apos; vote , we know that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force , and we know this because it was the last hurdle .

The aim is to complete this task and to report on the outcome of the negotiations during the June Council .
in writing . - The 2008 financial crisis showed clearly that European Supervisory Authorities are needed to coordinate the regulation and supervision of the financial sector in the European Union .
For example , we remember the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme and , in particular , those involved in the Israeli space sector , which have produced unpilered aeroplanes used in the attacks on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009 and led to dozens of people being killed .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for the efforts you have made to combat poverty as a country in the Presidency .
I agree that without a global agreement , all our efforts will remain .
I would also like to highlight one paragraph included in the draft Commission statement , which has been added to the proposal .
These three reports reflect the spirit and forecast stimulus that characterise the new strategy for the Single Market of Professor Mario Monti , and represent very good the sole purpose of revitalising the European single market with 50 measures which then reproduce , summarises and underlines this Parliament in its fourteen priorities .
Governments in the Gulf area are responding in different ways : with substantial financial packages to alleviate the most urgent social needs , with advertisements of political reforms , giving certain legislative powers to elected bodies , or with an open attitude to a profound and inclusive national dialogue .
As for Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument , there is no problem with the Strasbourg Court having the power of the Union involved .
I would prefer all of these issues again on the table during the negotiations on the reform of the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I would like to echo the admiration expressed during the debate regarding the courage of the people of both Tunisia and Egypt to express their discontent and disappointment with their respective regimes .
So I really do not understand why we cannot follow a similar agenda from that point of view .
The European Union has launched legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to employees affected by the consequences of far-reaching structural changes in world trade patterns and to help them reintegrate into the labour market .
The extensive nature of the final text and the protection it gives to consumers &apos; rights are a prize to their master in the negotiation .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to lay down a requirement that EU Member States should report annually to the Commission on the activities of their export credit agencies with regard to risk calculation and the disclosure of out-of-balance instruments and the notification of calculations of social and environmental risks is mandatory .
Mrs Ronzulli lli Rehn , who was in favour and chambled in favour .
This is an important fact , which demonstrates the will and the ability of Parliament to present itself as a candidate for a central role in the CFSP / ESDP , on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I therefore generally support this report , provided that Member States retain a key role in managing , designating and protecting wilderness areas .
Above all , however , after a long journey of several months , I have been reminded of this House &apos;s desire to see this service &apos;s birth in order to reflect the needs of the voters that you represent , and so that it can be very useful for it .
That concludes this item .
This reinforcement and other issues could have been addressed at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must remain indisputable .
So , as you can see , we are almost at the same level .
This is why this debate is important to remind you that this year , 2009 , the Commission made a commitment to present before this Parliament a communication to evaluate the potential threats at European level to freedom of expression and pluralism and to draw attention to the importance of drawing up a directive guaranteeing the pluralism of information to new technologies and , in particular , on television .
The effective implementation of the directive under examination and compensation for deficiencies appreciated in the course of the transposition and implementation of previous Directives would supplement the defence available to European Union citizens against discrimination .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report , as it stresses the importance of European political parties as an indispensable player in EU political life , putting forward concrete proposals with a view to creating a safe and transparent regulatory environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties .
Thus , if we want to achieve the objectives set out every week in this House , we need an ambitious budget , which means only less but more money in the future .

The joint debate is closed .

I am pleased to say that the Air Transport Rights Regulation has proved to be very important in providing a safety net which ensures that it is not passengers who are suffering from the punishment of the financial consequences of the disruption and that they are left to their fate during chaos .
As was done in 2004 , the Council Presidency will be invited to choose a candidate among the majority group in the European Parliament to take this important position and subsequently , on 15 July , it will be up to our Parliament to pronounce on this election , which will constitute one of the first political acts in the new parliamentary term .
We must call on all political forces to put an end to this crisis , because the alternative is Albania &apos;s isolation and the risk of its European prospects .
I agree with this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also insist on the need to demand the freedom of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , Cuba and the world , and I warn , however , of the risk of moving down rails that they have proved to be a failure to move towards democratisation and openness on the island , such as the embargo and blockade .
I wish , by the Sri Lankan people , that an expression I have heard many times - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - finally becomes something of the past .
Public opinion is very sensitive and is completely opposed to unnecessary painful practices .
Secondly , if we are serious about achieving a 95 % target by 2050 , then the road map requires a reduction of at least 30 % by 2020 .
There is broad acceptance of its need in the sector as a whole and between investment groups in particular , but three years after the entry into force of the directive on financial instruments markets , market participants have not reached an agreement to provide for a consolidated European covertail .
We must also give regulators the necessary powers to ensure that these rights are respected .
I would also like , as Mr Tajani , to remember with affection and to thank Commissioner Barrot for his work - which was very important - and also the willingness of the French Presidency .
This House has lost its absence , but the Swedish Presidency is certainly gaining .
Europe must ensure that we will be more efficient with regard to energy consumption .
Its purpose is to buy goods and services at the best price and quality .
However , we Swedish Social Democrats are pleased that , in the end , you did listen to our demands and those of Parliament in order for this programme to incorporate further aspects relating to the rights of women and children .
It is clear that the Member States are undergoing a lot of changes .
The opposite of what these organisations wanted .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that , in this area as in so many others , our institution has absolutely no ability to trial with regard to the dogmas we hold .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , I see two major problems in relation to the proposed amendment to Article 136 - one of them institutional and political .
So this is a step in the right direction .
However , I am not in favour of linking the fight against HIV with a sensitive issue such as abortion .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . - ( LV ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as regards the Council &apos;s annual report to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) in 2007 , I would like to highlight some of the important aspects from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the lack of any reference to undemocratic decisions and accusation of citizens , such as the ban on Communist parties and other organisations and the jailing of Communists and other opponents of EU Member States in central and Baltic Europe , is revealing the nature of the report .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must put a stop to free trade policies , we must stop the free movement of capital , we must encourage food sovereignty , we must declare global public water and energy , and we must combat socio-economic inequalities .
firstly , it must secure the future of agriculture in the Community even after 2013 ,
The question arises to me here as to whether that means that these are already existing projects , which are being financed by cohesion resources , or new projects .
For these reasons , we have to say that it is our duty to unite the people following the speech made today by President Mubarak , the attacks on the people and their decision to open the way to violence .
Today , I would like to thank Presidents Borrell and P√∂ttering and Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions for their support for the campaign of justice for Michael .
That is why I voted against the report .
With this binding target , for the EU and Portugal , I see more profit than losses .
To earn the same salary as a man would earn in a natural year , a woman should , on average , work until the end of February the year after , in other words 418 days .
For a decade they have suffered systematic discrimination and the threat of death if they do not integrate into Chinese society , thereby jeopardising their identity .
This report is on the proposal by the European Parliament and the Council on consumer rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would also like to thank the Commissioner for coming here tonight to explain to us the powers she seeks better .
He ignored the key issue : the reorganisation of the international monetary system .
Human rights must be its main concern .
As a result , these companies will not try to engage more in illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the common policy on EU visas has now led a crucial challenge with regard to Canada &apos;s visa requirement for 10 months now to the citizens of the Czech Republic .
The EMA has an essential role as a preferred source of objective information .
I have received one proposal to make a change in today &apos;s vote : after the meeting held yesterday between President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero , it was agreed that it is necessary to start talks immediately at the highest institutional level on certain procedural aspects relating to the adoption of the Council budget .
Subject : Ralpine railway Magistrals
Undoubtedly , if we were to be on the old brother path , one senator would warn Mr Trichet , his heirs , of course , to say : &apos; Housla tandem abutere , Trichete , understand nostrony , &apos; How far will he abuse our patience , Mr Trichet ?
Finally , Mr President , if I may , in order to dispel any doubt that may exist , I would like to propose that a European Parliament investigation committee be set up on this issue .
Service concessions were suppressed intentionally from the public procurement directives in order to achieve greater flexibility in this area and to take cultural differences into account .
I agree with some other ideas expressed , but in my opinion it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and intelligible .
I believe that this network could be of great use but , for the moment , it does not function effectively and does not fully utilise its potential .
It is , of course , true that EPAs are different from the Lom√© and Cotonou conventions that brought down EU-ACP relations for 30 years , but the unilateral preferences that characterise these agreements were questioned in the World Trade Organisation by other developing countries .
However , while we fully support the integration of the Roma community within the European Union , we have serious misgivings with regard to the participation of the European Union on issues that we consider to be the preserve of individual nations , such as access to health care , education , employment and housing .
It is also essential to give priority to food security , to agriculture , to the development of skills and , in particular , to economic growth and access to technology , as well as to the human and social development of LDCs .
We cannot go on with this situation .
The aim is ultimately to achieve better implementation of EU law and , as a result , to achieve more healthy animals and decent living conditions for them .
What action will you take to call on rich countries to contribute to the costs of the crisis ?
We also need to have better practice , because Slovenia , for example , continues its vehicles for its country .
It is also important that these solutions not only benefit our citizens now and in the future , but also ensure the future of our children .
If we want to prevent closure , then we need to keep the exploitation rate up to 30 % .
We need to address urgent priorities in this area .
Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing productivity gaps created by the crisis , but also to bringing productivity gains well .
It is a very important issue for all European citizens , and the way in which the Commission and Parliament grapple with it will say a lot about responsibility and transparency .
In short , let me emphasise that all the non-conventional measures we adopted during the period of financial stress are temporary in nature and the exit considerations were designed .
This report is terrible in relation to the behaviour of this Parliament .
the strict organisation of projects , the effective use of resources and clarity on their duration ;
You cannot do so at the moment and that is why you are at risk , as you said .
I would also like to say first of all that I support all Turkey &apos;s efforts and attempts on the path to democratisation .
In this Commission proposal , the concept of micro-enterprises is widened to define them as companies which , at the balance sheet date , do not exceed the limits of the two criteria : a total balance of EUR 500 000 , a liquid business volume of EUR 1 million and / or an average average number of employees during the 10 000 year .
However , we must fulfil our commitment to climate change : we all recognise that we are world leaders on this issue .
rapporteur . - Madam President , you took the guard a little low because I had not seen the change in time altogether today , but I am very grateful for the opportunity to talk to the House about a subject of great importance to the financial services sector , that is to say the insurance and reinstatement sector : what we have done with the Solvency II report and how we have now put it to Parliament for what I think will be a very specific basis for the European Union .
It is therefore absolutely essential to move up to 30 % , and I will conclude by echoing Barack Obama &apos;s words when he said that we could leave jobs in the future to our competitors , or we could seize the opportunity of the century , as they have already started to do so .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to make four comments .
That is why , a few Member States and I have invited an expert , who has investigated the trade in organs and deliberate killing of people in China in order to obtain organs for transplantation , so that he sells and speaks to us tomorrow .
President-in-Office of the Council , we wish to thank you for your extremely constructive and extensive report and wish you luck in your presidency .
These initiatives , with funds from the EC , bring us all together to work specifically on specific projects and programmes which combine the strength of each institution and , in this way , offer an excellent meltdown in which to forge the development of our joint work .
- ( SK ) Once again we have a problem with respect for the ethnic minority in Slovakia , and it is the minister for education , a member of the radical nationalist party that is in government .
In view of the necessary guarantees , such as the possibility of European citizens tabling an administrative resource and receiving the same treatment as US citizens , and the repression of the amount of time stored by information , cooperation between Europe and the United States , in this case , is an appropriate tribute to the negative effects of globalisation .
The EIB can and must play an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean .
I therefore support the call for an investigation into the quota of margin in the production and distribution chain .
However , if you always put forward the principle that polluter pays ( which I am ready to discuss with you ) , then it turns out that traffic jams are the Member States for failing to provide sufficient infrastructure .
The first is the appropriations for the mobility of students .
But the important thing is that we are aware of the fact that , although it has particular intensity on this southern European border , we have an opportunity here for us to strengthen the impact and the linking of citizenship with what Europe means .
Today , Europe is losing leak despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of people trained countries than more successful countries such as China and India .
That is why we need more and better Europe : a more united and ambitious Europe .
I am sure that they are a step forward .
The Greek Communist Party opposes and voted against the amendments to adapt the European Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following observation : it is extremely surprising that , despite the fact that Albania &apos;s growth indicators are constantly attacking , with growth of more than 2 % in 2010 , in the midst of global economic instability , and that 3 % in 2011 , social tension is expected to be made worse rather than improving .
Human trafficking is also a serious problem within the European Union .
There are other issues on which I would like to emphasise , coinciding with what Atanas Pizizov has said .
In Southern Sudan , the EU has a significant contribution to make to stabilisation , development and the creation of institutional capacity .
As you said , the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution , which provides for a decentralisation by regional administration by the people living there , must be implemented and in this regard the EU can be of great help .
Of course , let me repeat , there may be different opinions , and there are indeed differences between the Commission and the Council and also between certain Members of this House with regard to the regulation on aquaculture transport ; some would rather separate transport legislation by sea from river transport .
I am in favour of justification for this proposal , namely the need to define a coherent , global framework for the development of investments in energy infrastructure in the European Union , which will allow the Commission to monitor the state of play of investment projects planned in the energy sector .
The elections were comforting : in 1995 , a global consensus was reached whereby men and women were equal to all intents , even in political , economic , legal and social terms .
The Serbian authorities must do their utmost to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly implemented in the country and must remain vigilant as to the continuing decrease in the level of corruption in Serbia and that officials who abuse their position are subject to severe sanctions .
In short , the Europe we are striving for - a Europe of justice and social progress , economic and social cohesion , cooperation between sovereign states with the same rights and where the same level is being promoted - could hardly be achieved by the guidelines that this Commission is proposing to follow .
From the point of view of democracy and legitimacy , it is important to communicate to our citizens what the EU does .
The Germans would not be doing justice to our national unity if we did not consider it a contribution to the unity of Europe , in the light of the historical events that I have just mentioned here .
To put it simply , a single person will carry out the tasks of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner .
As I pointed out on another occasion in this House , I am in favour of a Europe of countries that cooperate with one another .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained from the vote .
Furthermore , the compulsory registration of all lobbyists wishing to have permanent access to Parliament and the Commission is a step forward towards greater transparency in relations between these organisations and the European institutions .
However , if we adopt everything during the first reading , Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights .
This is a very important step which allows for a more effective strengthening of the fundamental rights of European Union citizens .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in the coming weeks , as it is urgently needed .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation because most vans are bought by large and small businesses , which are already well aware of the need to economise and make fuel efficient .
I propose a study on consolidated accounts .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a general comment and then put two or three questions , depending on the time I have allocated .
We must also remember that having Turkey in the European Union , we will have countries such as Iraq , Iran and Syria at our borders .
I think that , finally , we have to understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without constantly bearing in mind the parameter of employment .
What would we expect then from the EU ?
We must not forget that with every decision we take , we are responsible to our voters , who are experiencing difficult times .
However , for that very reason , these agencies are also a potential factor in mass distortion of trade if their funding operations do not respect common standards .
I think there can only be good governance of the Single Market if there is up-to-date and good quality information about how it works .
in writing . - ( ET ) In the current time of global economic crisis ( i.e. the economic recession and growing unemployment ) , there is a reality in the EU labour market that a growing number of people will be made redundant , which will further increase the total number of people suffering from poverty and alienation in Europe .
Of course , they had a flag already and they had an anthem , but they started to talk about building a new state .
To a certain extent , this is covered by corporate social responsibility , but it cannot be put into practice without a national framework .
This is a real compromise solution .
Furthermore , appropriate operational assistance must be guaranteed in the event of an accident , providing passengers with the services and articles that they most need .
The Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can therefore state the budget at last as approved .
We must support the creation of private funding mechanisms and the adoption of more frequent public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
However , we are now pursuing the objective of putting an end to misleading advertising on the Internet , which encourages people to buy products that do not only cure but can even harm patients .
Mr President , I would like to table an oral amendment , removing two parts of the amendment , namely the words &apos; by the Colombian army &apos; and &apos; Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete initiatives and measures to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma centres in Europe .
Madam President , I think that once again , this is one of those reports that many people can welcome .
Once again , we must draw attention to the excessive delay between the emergence of the disaster , the decision to mobilise the Solidarity Fund and the effective delivery of Union aid to the Member States and regions affected .
We need to have legal evidence and that is why we have asked the French Government to pass on the dossiers of people to us .
Europe must be more than the sum of 27 national interests .
Meanwhile , Mr Reinfeldt is presenting the report of the last six months of European Council activity .
The drawback of austerity measures , which will involve working people having to give up their public sector jobs , must become an advantage for the creation of businesses , taking advantage of entrepreneurship by reducing the initial costs for businesses so that they can create the private sector that we find ourselves in at present .
The two parties involved have still not been able to develop a common vision , so progress has been stalled .
Is this free trade agreement actually only suited to the world and to the division of economic competition between Europe and India that we know about today , or will it also be true for 10 or 15 years ?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access across the EU in 2013 and rapid Internet connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis , it is mainly due to the lack of immediate action that was needed when the crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and the poor in Europe must mobilise their power against these disastrous policies and in favour of a truly democratic and socialist Europe , and that means opposing the policies of this new European Commission .
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives set out in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
Animal welfare requirements are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when establishing policies in sectors such as the internal market .
First of all , it is expressed at the level of regions and their cultural heritage , and it is an asset that will be taken into account and highlighted in the context of regional development policy .
I think this is where we should concentrate our efforts now .
It will need all its weapons of persuasion to give fresh impetus to international trade policy in the EU .
Indeed , this reserve is a &apos; accounting &apos; method that must be used for any emergency contingency that might arise during the current financial year .
Let us take a minute &apos;s silence in memory of our Tunisian friends .
Many errors and a king block on the shelter of the defendants : the euro .
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have just outlined , I believe that there is already a solid basis with which to improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research within the framework programme .
We are taking this debate too technocratic .
I therefore congratulate Mr Mill√°n Mon on on on on a brilliant report , which is so timely for strengthening relations between the two continents .
That is why we have carried out this significant simplification of Community law .
Unfortunately , important amendments proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have been rejected and , as a result , the residents of a Member State will not be able to sign initiatives , thereby preventing the equal participation of residents , regardless of their nationality , nor are there any guarantees that signatures coincide with the numbers of identification of signatories .
I call for the organisation of an independent committee composed of local and international legal experts who conduct investigations and posts for the violent events that took place at the fraudulent elections in December 2007 .
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West also depends , to a large extent , on the results in Afghanistan .
It has gone a long way and it has to be stopped .
Providing a guide for public and private operators and creating a programme of training and mobility to know how to implement multi-level governance policies in practice could be effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope that our Spanish and Italian colleagues will join it , but we cannot wait any longer , because everyone is looking for the innovation market .
In addition , I believe that we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies , starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , respond adequately to these requirements .
Mr President , the ongoing negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam must include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
Without prejudice to the adoption of some of the important measures proposed in this report , I would like to draw attention to an essential issue for this problem .
However , that method will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy , to unfair competition or to unforeseen price fluctuations .
This will have no negative impact on cod reserves as there is a low catalyst catalyst at present .
The sanctions proposed are proportionate and necessary , and it is expected to be deterrent to prevent improper commercial practices adopted by commercial operators .
In my opinion , this criterion is discriminatory and unreasonable , since , as is the case with Portugal , the majority of these families live in shelters in rural areas .
This is a measurement of poverty in absolute and exclusively financial terms , and does not take into account the diversity of the 27 Member States ; its argument line can be summarised in a way that is limited to solvency .
Consequently , both ODA and new funds will be needed .
The ethical audit of the work of this project had a positive outcome , and this has been certified .
In my opinion , the proposed new level of cofinancing of 75 % is too high .
Two precise points , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissioner for having focused her attention on the issue of Tunisia .
The rapporteur regrets , above all , that the citizens are not aware of the rights they would enjoy .
Setting an area of security , justice and freedom within the European Union is crucial to all of us and , without doubt , an example to the democratic Europe that we are building , and many of us believe that Europol should be an instrument that is an instrument that is suitable , in spite of all this , we all consider the most important , the fact that the exchange of resources - particularly human resources , but also the technical resources to fight organised crime and we see all kinds of legal freedoms - should be monitored with maximum legal rights .
It is therefore crucial to take any measure that reinforces the guarantees of independence and transparency of IAs , and this will help maximise the contribution of the instrument to the decision-making process and to ensure the quality and expediency of the activities of EU institutions .
My second comment is that the strategy must strengthen the internal cohesion of the EU , in other words its convergence .
I should not add , I must add , the direction in which the Commission is heading , since its proposal , through the regulation adopted by this House , focused on reform of the system in force of agencies , which are private , and on the absolute rigorous consolidation of transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest , honestly , in their credit rating work .
It also calls on the European Commission to assess costs and benefits arising from the creation of a totally independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
Even before the crisis we are facing today , the Member States of the European Union were already facing social problems resulting from weak economic growth , a difficult demographic situation and the difficulties of living in an increasingly globalised international economy .
However , there are reasons why they cause a little concern , related to the danger of the enthusiasm of the Moldovans falling .
We in this Parliament have always maintained a firm attitude in defence of the autonomous rights of the people of Tibet , which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence .
Although a directive will soon see the light , I voted with my fellow Members in favour of a resolution that sets out the direction that Parliament has to take on this issue .
Bearing in mind the circumstances , I believe that the introduction of a system of monitoring and supervision of medicinal products which consult patients properly is essential .
It is worth fighting for them and that is exactly what I am going to do .
These costs still add a few exceptions , provided that the Member State in question has a good justification to do so .
This framework decision should not lead to excessive bureaucracy in cases where , for the problems to resolve , there are more suitable options available .
The Bank did not see that it came up with a major crisis , nor did it point out precisely in terms of its regulation , which is far from perfect .
However , as a serious organisation , the European Union should be better prepared for such situations , and should , in particular , be ready to react effectively in emergency situations .
- Kaczmarek report
We should therefore only support their inclusion in the event that these measures are not effective .
I have made a commitment to inform the European institutions about this citizens &apos; protest .
The EU and the industrialised nations should adopt the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 40 % by 2020 and , in the long term , attempting to reduce emissions by 80 % by 2050 , compared to 1990 levels .
- Report : Maria do C√©u Patr√£o Neves
I would like to be more specific about two important matters that have been mentioned several times during the debate .
Firstly , on behalf of the Council , I would like to thank the European Parliament for its cooperation and the spirit of compromise that has enabled us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of bus and coach passengers in the EU , particularly with regard to disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons for this is the fragmentation of the European defence equipment market .
The issue of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy has been very important since the start of this period .
The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions , which will probably include changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations and both require a Commission proposal and the adoption of a codecision procedure .
We strongly support the development of civilian capabilities to have a proper balance between resources .
in writing . - The situation throughout North Africa is undoubtedly dangerous , but at the same time hopeful .
Coordination requires constant improvement , and the responsibility of the Member States in this area should certainly be greater .
The Irish people , with their very strong vote , give us encouragement and strength to continue to thrive and build a strong Europe and , above all , a federal Europe .
While the protection of the environment and the safeguarding of public health go hand in hand , I think that we need to balance the needs of consumers and those of producers .
It is an enemy that we must resolve together .
We must work together with other countries that are large consumers , such as the United States , China , Russia and Japan to address this problem and create a comprehensive alert system and the registration of illegal logging and the countries involved through Interpol , an appropriate UN body that uses satellite systems which incorporate the most modern technology .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support to the sector to undermine its long-term competitiveness .
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
Due to the impact of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has been the subject of particular attention by European citizens and European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that this topic is too important to continue with the lie we have experienced in Europe .
Of course , we were not aware of the names of the candidates , as was pointed out , and we had no female candidate but , with Commissioner Barnier , he explained this properly .
We regret the rate of abstention on the European elections and the &apos; no &apos; votes in referendums .
We will ask what the problem is and we will communicate it , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal agreements cover a wide range of regulations and errors in legislative provisions , whether intentioned or not , may lead to competition being eliminated .
We also need a common European asylum system that is more effective and more protective .
That concludes Question Time .
I am also aware of the fact that everyone is interested in participating in the formation of police cooperation that respects human rights and respects the values of the European Union .
The same horror as Picassa Picassa in his Guernica - our Guernica ravaged by the Conor Boards of Legion seven d√©cador .
In this respect , speculators are also trying to speculate on an unfavourable economic situation and sometimes even getting worse .
Mr Bovev√©on is right and Mr Fajmon ...
We need to promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale agriculture , organic agriculture and local distribution , to ensure agricultural diversity throughout Europe .
The Rapkay report on the modification of the Staff Regulations in the context of the establishment of the European External Action Service , the EEAS , is a very important document on the path towards establishing a Union foreign policy .
We therefore consider , and should again discuss this at first reading , that the starting point reflects this priority and we agree with the rapporteur &apos;s emphasis on the issue of multilingualism and buildings , which we have always given them a serious priority , except for the emphasis on legislation .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of leading a delegation from this Parliament &apos;s Committee on International Trade , which attended the Seventh Ministerial Conference in Geneva .
Bearing this in mind , Europe will be able to make headway at the top .
I have asked the Member States to present names , including women .
Firstly , it is essential to maintain a geographic divide with regard to financial assistance from the EU budget for the countries of the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe , in accordance with the provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective , and also to continue to provide support to these countries through European Investment Bank loans .
For us , Kosovo is a singular case and we remember that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States .
All these are reasons enough not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU Summit , in response to the requests of the Belarusian opposition .
This is a very important approach to pointing out what the humanist and holistic elements of our policy , including in the case of the internal market , are really .
Mr President , I would like to offer my support to everything my colleagues have said about the rights of disabled passengers , to what Mrs Kadenbach said about children , the issue of fire-fighting security and , in particular , the issue of water rolling in all EU hotels and the necessary future vision of the new proposal .
I was going to ask a question on the gender balance within the Commission , so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment .
It is clear in the report that only the Member States have authority in matters of national defence and security , in which we believe it is important to emphasise .
Similarly , the Member States are most concerned about asset stripping and control taking conceals of those who had no low levels of notification of participations or notification of contracts of differences .
I would also like to thank Mr Lehne for his approach .
In other words , the Copenhagen Accord contains references to the level of ambition needed to tackle climate change for the climate change agreement from 2012 , sets the basis for a financial package and proposes serious commitments on reductions in emissions .
AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis continue to claimed four million lives every year .
From a more strictly commercial point of view , I would like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) cannot be used to hinder the sale of medicines available at more competitive , safe and generic medicine that do not violate intellectual property rights and whose only crime is produced in emerging countries such as India and Brazil and put Western pharmaceutical industries in place .
After all , MEPs have the right to give their opinion .
That is unacceptable .
We want to be involved .
That is why we will have to find the appropriate level of financial and technological compensation .
This is also an area where we can intervene more decisively as part of the policy of protecting competition and consumer protection .
It is also a shame that these politicians are asking us to accept the result of the second referendum , when they did not de facto accept the outcome of the first referendum .
As co-author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I wish to express my thanks to the Members who voted in favour of this document today .
I would like to finish , Mr President , Minister , with a proposal for future generations .
It is absolutely essential to establish clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) in order to consolidate the internal market and improve environmental quality in the European Union , as well as to restore strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government have also underlined that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union and that we will also ask our neighbours to undergo these stress tests .
A very clear distinction needs to be maintained between the mandate of military bodies and humanitarian bodies , as well as engaging in dialogue between these bodies in order to foster mutual understanding .
The Commission is working to make a more systematic assessment of the quality of public finances that takes account of performance aspects of the budget .
This will be a priority for me as Commissioner for Trade .
So the Commission could present amended or new proposals depending on the situation .
The United States has yet to establish clear and transparent criteria for denying visas in certain Member States .
The issue of funding remains outstanding .
To the rest of the House , I must say that Turkey &apos;s constructive criticism is necessary ; we are ourselves critical friends .
Research has shown that gains in human trafficking go beyond drug smuggling .
In my own corner of the world , farmers feel abandoned and directly insulted by the fact that they are , of course , unaware of what they do and they have to tell them .
No .
That is why I voted for this resolution , bearing in mind the negative impact of market liberalisation on local economies , underlines the strategic importance of reasonable tariff protection .
Generally speaking , I am voting in favour of the proposals put forward in this report with the aim of restoring the European economy through increased financial support for projects in the field of energy .
The report on the European Refugee Fund , by calling for the resettlement of refugees in the EU , is even more incomprehensible .
This is an estimate that could be overhauled .
economists use mathematic models to highlight the value of domestic tasks .
Only if we have all the information about this kind of case can we talk about a consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
I repeat : &apos; in no way &apos; .
It is also pressing , especially on the eve of the Copenhagen conference , for the EU and other international players to articulate their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
I would like to refer to a statement made by Commissioner Rehn , whom I personally believe , who said that Nigeria is a very poor country : that is not true , Nigeria is a very rich country , but is made up of a kind by an inepet and corrupt leader leader who has plundered the country &apos;s resources , leaving millions of citizens poorer .
Finally , Mr M√∂lzer , what I want to say is not as pessimistic .
I therefore call on the Council to announce its position with regard to Parliament &apos;s new proposal without delay , so that ACP countries can benefit from the measures announced for 2010 , and I call on the Commission to ensure that social and environmental requirements are adhered to by producers and exporters outside the ACP countries .
This requires the Commission - as coordinator for the Energy Community - to put Ukraine back on track and remind it of its obligations in terms of security of supply for Europe .
in writing . - Naturally , we deplore the victims of any aggressive and authoritarian regime , regardless of the atrocities that were committed in Europe or , for example , in the former colonies of Europe .
The main purpose of the regulation must be to implement a new culture of control and responsibility , rather than imposing a bureaucratic and expensive process for controlling each product .
Member of the Commission . - The EU &apos;s current competition policy with regard to vertical agreements is very favourable to sales on the Internet and I am sure you are aware of that , Mr President .
Instead , the report contains clear recommendations on the second and third mistake , and they all point in the right direction .
As far as transport is concerned , there is a need to do much more and to impose more obligations on those who manufacture vehicles to make vehicles more efficient in terms of consumption .
The financial situation in some euro area countries , which are being considered today , clearly shows the risks caused by the departure from the Stability and Growth Pact agreements .
I therefore think it would be very reasonable to consider how to make better use of the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and , it seems , a financial instrument that is necessary only to support energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewable energy .
The Commission and we ourselves in Parliament have deliberately chosen not to raise the issue of the process of investment funds in any way , and this is because we work in the event that the sector is going to keep its promise to deal with the matter on its own , without legislative pressure .
This brings me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned , I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is the world &apos;s fourth largest producer of cotton , responsible for 9 % of global production , followed by the European Union with almost 5.5 % .
In this case , the Council and , above all , Parliament are also involved in deciding on the composition of the Commission and on the portfolios that you have and on the programme for the next five years that you present .
We must understand that actions have been going on for only one year now and that we should increase the pace in 2009 .
Of course , this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people , because the country has now entered recession and living conditions are worsening for workers and people , inequality is increasing and also poverty .
These objectives , President of the Commission , President of the Council , are already set out in the Europe 2020 strategy .
We have already started working with many Arab countries on initiatives to get gas through Turkey , let us hope that the Nabucco pipeline will come .
This is why intervention for their total eradication is an objective of health policy and the best way in which national governments can contribute through this measure is by showing flexibility .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for your cooperation , as this is my last speech in this House .
I am aware that there are currently significant differences between the electoral rules of the various Member States .
Many generalist doctors are , apparently , too late in dealing with dementia medicines , in order not to exceed their budgets ; that is counterproductive .
Paradoxically , this instrument could easily be misused in practice , not only by extremists but also by very powerful and influential interest groups , and I say this because we consider the threshold of 1 000 000 support declarations not to be too high in the context of the demographic potential of the Union .
The 2010 budget sets this systematic perspective .
According to the report by the UN task force , victims of trafficking come from different social stress , from the most prosperous to the poorest , the best educated to the most iletrated , and young people from older women .
President-in-Office of the Council . - It is indeed a very important question .
We need more and better European economic governance so that national measures support this line , including the tax on financial transactions that I encourage the Commission to look very carefully at it , including in a European context .
I believe that mutual recognition of medical prescriptions between the Member States is very important , since it is not just a matter of providing proper healthcare but also of ensuring good care services , but we still have some time to resolve that detail .
I would first like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports which raise important issues with regard to the contribution of EU trade policy to achieving the fundamental objectives of public policy : respect for human rights , search for economic and social justice , sustainable growth and respect for the environment and , in particular , for the climate system .
Consumers will have to resort to a number of resources in the event of a product not complying with the contract , and they will have the right to claim damages in the event that no solution is offered .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people with a politician who was going to present his candidacy for the elections to elect the provincial governor .
This new , intelligent and asymmetrical system will generate more stringent monitoring , more thorough assessments by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank and the elaboration of recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans .
The Syrian people deserve the long-awaited political reforms , especially in relation to freedom of expression , assembly , political participation and governance .
Many of them were British citizens who were trafficked in the UK , not external origin , if I can use this expression .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union grew up again in the third quarter of 2009 , which could lead us to think that the worst has happened again .
In this context , it is expected that Greece will adopt a global programme of structural reform with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of public administration , advancing health and pension reform , improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the wage negotiation system , improving the functioning of the market for products and the business environment and maintaining stability in the banking and financial sector .
We believe that it is still essential to refer to the following when establishing agreements between sovereign countries : respect for the sovereignty of the country and its people , mutual interest , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account each country &apos;s particularities , the assessment of what each can bring to the agreement from an economic , social and cultural point of view .
I believe that the transition to a sustainable and green economy will go ahead even if we do not impose excessive legislative measures .
It seems that everyone has forgotten the contribution of the US and , of course , NATO , in the interests of peace in Europe .
I think that we should view this as a valid opportunity to deal with what Europe desperately needs : economic growth , jobs , a dynamic sector of small businesses , more innovation , more efficient public procurement , citizenship will be judging on all of these issues .
I think it is not up to us to predict the possible development of the situation in those countries .
The second project involves concessions .
Madam President , during the 2004 European elections in Ireland , it introduced a smoking ban in the workplaces , so we are in a position to send out a dead letter outside restaurants and bail-outs .
Indeed , at a time of profound contrition of state action , the increase in the EU budget is an act of trust in the common project and of strengthening the measures taken at supranational level .
I am sure that we will be able to send a positive message , then we will get out and cut our voice .
This report contains guidelines on how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content , as well as the procedures to be adopted .
The language law creates imbalance .
Perhaps once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force definitively on 1 December , British domestic political debate may also be left out of this House .
That is the difference between the reality of the situation and the impossible dream of the European Parliament .
Furthermore , we share the view that all national parliaments must be fully involved , in accordance with their budgetary and control prerogatives , in order to increase transparency , accountability and accountability regarding any decision made , including at European level .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , five more questions have been tabled concerning economic governance and Europe 2020 .
That is why I believe that we should encourage the promotion of SOLVIT to participate actively in the national authorities and the European Commission , as well as the Members of this Parliament .
This is a system based on real policies and guidelines , and now , Mr Michel , on protagonists and on a rhetoric which have led to the current situation : promoting the agro-industrial model , in line with the protection of the interests of big agri-food industry , and as a result of the impoverishment of global agricultural industries ; years and years of inadequate investment in agricultural activities , of the 70 % of small and substitute agricultural industry .
From an economic point of view , the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs , and the CAP must allow this problem to be resolved .
I call once again on the Commission to constantly put pressure on its contacts with the government to ensure that this promise is kept until it is in the written right of the Republic of Congo .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I fully understand the significant interest of this Parliament in the measures being taken both inside and outside the Union to address the challenges some of the Member States face in relation to their public finances .
We support the will of nations that want a better life , emancipation and a more favourable future .
You even have the support of Irish MEPs from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is an aspect that we should and must indeed adopt in order to make the world a more free , fairer and more social place in the future .
It was my office that prepared the informal document on sanctions against Syria ; we got to grips .
The day we manage to get rid of poverty , the ghost of Communism will disappear forever .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the revision of competition rules in the field of horizontal cooperation - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That is why you fought together , be it scourges or orange .
I believe that this procedure , while strengthening public safety in the EU food sector , introduces greater clarity for the Member States and third countries which export beef products to the EU .
In view of this , it seems unwise to look for an agreement with Mercosur , especially since the Swedish High Institute for Food and Biotechnology has pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef may be 30 and five times more than the Irish beef .
Therefore , as agreed with the Council , the following text must be added at the end of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the original regulation , which is paragraph 2 ( b ) of the amended regulation ( b ) : &apos; The same exchange rates will be applied in order to review annually the value of rates regulated by Articles 4 , 4 and Article 6 ( 3 ) , when other than the euro , are the case &apos; .
Today , the Irish Government has called for European solidarity , and has rightly obtained it .
Just look at Ireland , a country hit particularly hard by the financial crisis : its membership of monetary union has protected it from a crisis of even greater proportions .
He fear that the Germans will claim Sudeten properties and , after hearing German politicians on the subject , I think he is right to be afraid .
an increase in assistance from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , thus facilitating enhanced financial assistance for technical activities relating to the drafting and implementation of projects ;
If we do not put something into practice that makes the countries realise that there will be harsh consequences if they put forward economically irrational policies , we will arrive nowhere .
We need to improve and promote complementary activities for dealing with climate change .
( Applause from the left )
As is always the case with these complex issues , I have had the enormous cooperation of my team of shadow rapporteurs - Mrs Vergnaud and Mrs R√ºhle , and Mr Bu≈üoi .
In Russia , freedom of the press and of the media is a truly important problem .
Similarly , it is up to each Member State to decide whether to sign or ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which are the two main instruments put forward by the Council of Europe .
It is a structured dialogue that therefore gives us the opportunity to exchange views on these matters that concern us .
Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability , with people who are already getting protection in work and certain aid to ensure that they will not lose their jobs and then will not have to pass through the recycling cycle and develop skills in one or two years to get another job , to keep the existing jobs in the sector .
Madam President , our questions have been asked with the intention of highlighting the advantages that our citizens can expect from a package of measures like this and what we can offer in this package .
I voted in favour of the report as it also adds some substantial improvements to the European Commission text , in particular , concerning data protection for individuals .
We have also carried out a review of unused funds since 2009 for a total of EUR 1.9 billion for the energy sector and EUR 420 million more to make broadband Internet available in category II .
Thank you very much for your proposal and your very clear message .
You can also see part of that content in your work , as well as an attempt to adopt a holistic approach , which has not made the success that we anticipate , in any case , well .
Once again , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission , which has sometimes had some hard hand , and the Council , in which we have tried to find reasonable solutions in the night sittings and in many trialogue sessions , because they have also just approved the reasonable compromise we reached .
In order to ensure integrated and coordinated action , the Commission , together with Eurocontrol , established a European Crisis Coordination Clula on 4 May 2010 , following the Council meeting of Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010 .
At the same time , we must remember that this is rarely the problem itself , in this case illegal logging , which creates the conditions for the illegal trade in timber .
Indeed , I come from Portugal , from Portugal &apos;s region of the Azores , where the dairy sector is very important and is locked up in rather fragile social terms and where it would , in fact , be essential for the quota system to be maintained beyond 2015 .
People are not the product of different cultures , different cultures are the product of different people .
In fact , in some cases , they are so good that they are to be taken into account .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small country in terms of population , with around 300 000 inhabitants , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , Members have an important role to play in analysing decisions on health claims .
For that reason , we give a resounding &apos; yes &apos; to Nabucco , but as strongly as possible , it is our decision to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our population .
Political parties can be banned , there is corruption in the legal system , there is abuse of human rights and there is no freedom of expression or association such as the one in countries like Britain or most European states .
It is also quite obvious that we need a combination of energy sources as broad as possible , as this will stabilise the energy situation and , as a result , the diversity of each nation , and soon develop in Europe as well .
However , I am doubtful when this Parliament invoked international law to condemn certain sweeping practices , when the legal basis for this is far from clear .
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I clearly express my full support to the Tunisian people and the democratic revolution of historical ballot boxes that they have started .
Furthermore , it calls on the Member States to take appropriate and effective policy measures , such as specific action plans or social measures to reduce energy poverty and to regularly report on their initiatives to address this problem .
If you push forward with a law through the Hungarian Parliament and the decrees , then you can only be modified by a two-thirds majority , and you know that you will not be easy to amend it again after the next elections .
Generalised tariff references ( debate )
Today , we voted in plenary on the recommendation concerning harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The issue of a new feeling of mutual trust presents us with another major problem .
This year , we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS , but it will only be possible to assess the actual costs after the first year of operation , when the European Parliament is presented with a report on all the costs related to the work of the EEAS .
My issue concerns Pakistan , whose permanent instability , as we all know , also influences the crisis in the entire region and in Afghanistan .
Of course , we cannot forget the natural differences that exist between men and women .
We must also not forget these factors , even when it comes to the idea expressed in the proposal to allocate the revenues generated by infrastructure charges .
( HU ) Mr President , what I am pleased with this directive is a clear definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists , and the proposed solution to the issue of the lack of professionals available in the patient &apos;s country .
Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , if I may , I will comment directly on the questions and questions that have been asked .
Last week &apos;s committee I came to the Belgian Presidency as a fantasy presidency .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on Iran , as I am concerned about the continuing human rights violations there , particularly as regards freedom of association , expression and information , and because I support the democratic wishes of the Iranian people .
In particular , fast-start financing is going to be very important .
One thing is to create such a mechanism , but it must also be accessible and understandable to European citizens in order to enable them to make the most of this resource .
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive , but also make them safer , since the regulatory authorities and enforcement authorities are beginning to cooperate more closely in all matters of certification , inspections and enforcement to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
Moreover , their private vertide not only improves the image that Europe conveys to the world , but also promotes European citizenship .
Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we discussed today intended to amend the regulations adopted in 2004 , which improved and harmonised the security standards relating to the protection of passports and travel documents of European Union citizens against fraudulent use , while introducing identification biometric data .
Secondly , some kind of temporary institutional framework must be created for the decision-making mechanism .
Having said that , one positive thing : some of the agreements that we have had at the last time are very good , for example , the free trade agreement with Korea .
That is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Frankly , I also hope that Belgrade will realise that its current prospect of constructive work with the European Union is much more effective than the constant effort to rewrite history .
However strange that it may seem , at this stage , that the European Commission has found no argument or the time to influence the Latvian Government to end this discrimination on language issues .
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make all forms of help to the Pakistani Government urgently abolish this pernicious discrimination against religious minorities in the country .
This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration , organised crime and human trafficking .
It is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for it .
It is clear that , more than ever , it is necessary for financial institutions to stop for once and reconsider their approach .
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards , and we have achieved this in committee .
The main objective of aid for trade is to increase the internal and international competitiveness of 48 states .
Although the rationality of the internalisation of external costs is accepted as a starting point , it does not preserve the one that , in order to alleviate congestion , only for the large tonne vehicles are penalised by leaving passenger cars out , in the same terms as the old motto of &apos; polluter pays &apos; is clearly applied .
I was encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary session .
In addition , we have concerns when we look at the starting point .
The first objective of the EU and the governments of its Member States , whether central right or centre left , is to safeguard the continued profitability of monopolies by making the weight of the capitalist economic crisis expensive for the working classes of the EU .
Therefore , good practice must be disseminated and the awareness of local decision makers about the potential of ICT must be increased .
Mr President , we have been unable to hear the English interpretation of the previous speech , in which I was very interested .
However , in the face of this recast , this codification , there is a very important aspect to do with the full restructuring of the trans-European transport networks for the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s joint resolution on Ukraine is crucial to the Ukrainians , but let us not forget that it is also very important for the citizens of the EU because Ukraine is an important partner for us in particular in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy in Eastern Europe .
For this reason , the Commission must have a strong voice .
We cannot interfere in an issue where the US Government has exclusive competence .
People who manage our forests are paid little or paid nothing to fulfil these hidden functions that many people take for granted .
Unfortunately , it should also be said that the unresolved list of problems is growing .
With regard to Mr Salafranca &apos;s valuable report on the EU strategy in relations with Latin America , I would like to call on the Council and the Commission , both represented in Baroness Ashton , to take urgent action on three issues .
There are large distributors , with a strong market presence in some of the Member States , but there are also many small distributors who are most pleased with what we are now proposing now that what has been in place since 2002 , because they have seen that some aspects , not loved by the 2002 legislator , have not benefited them , but have made it difficult for them to withstand competition from large distributors .
The &apos; EU regional policy partnership for peace , security and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; , which the Committee on Development launched when adopting its report in April 2007 , must be formed .
During those years , specifically after the historic enlargement of 2004 , the context and ambitions of the European Security and Defence Policy changed extremely .
Spain is taking up the witness of the Presidency of the European Union , just as the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force .
In this respect , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and is included among the priority actions of the Single Market Act .
I would like to strongly support Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
The Commission draft was amended in accordance with the report put to the vote now , in line with the Commission &apos;s recommendations on Legal Affairs .
It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading .
These are the people who are most in need , and they must not be excluded on the basis of their location .
Every medical assistance , regardless of its distinctive features , falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
But I would like to warn this House that a recent study by Cardiology shows , once again , serious limitations on such methodology as a result of lower participation by women in such tests .
The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , nor should we prevent them from achieving social and environmental objectives .
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste , especially in this essentially agricultural region , for the data to be verified and for an exchange system for best practice to be set up .
It is a completely incomprehensible law which states that priests , oshops and Orthodox patriarchic must be Turkish citizens .
The most significant point of the position taken by Parliament is the attention it pays to the dispersion of the measures , which may result in a lack of cohesion , not only as a body of legislation but also in its application , in particular .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has secured the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least , the issue of the digital Single Market has made decisive progress as it is included among the EU &apos;s priorities .
It would be a significant step forward in the direction of transparency , openness and clarity in the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , because it makes every sense of the world to discuss this .
Is this the economic development model that Europe must propose to Europeans ?
As a rule , I do not permit the Members to exceed their allocated time , but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s statement was of particular importance to us .
We want an efficient strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment , a strategy that ultimately improves the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube Region .
It is , of course , a great conquer since , without getting into consideration on the legal basis , this directive amounts to recognition of unquestionable rights to patients and opens them a new range of possibilities for them to access the best treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us the pleasure that the EU budget has been spent regularly and legally , and I really worry about the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money when I took the office of audit by the European Commission in 2002 .
It is a huge challenge for me and a great honour .
If we are honest , we must recognise our historic responsibility for climate change , and that our per capita emissions are still much higher than those of China or India , for example .
I am convinced that the dialogue that will continue to be constructive .
We therefore regret that , as with Europol , the rush has overturned the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal aimed at implementing a simpler additional method for using the European Social Fund &apos;s reservations to ensure that it can react more quickly and more effectively to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing .
Frankly , I should have voted against the composition of the Commission , but together with weak candidates there were also a number of good candidates - including the Polish candidate , Janusz Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - It is very nice , Mr Kirkhope , but there are , in fact , 26 other Member States in the European Union , so you will understand that , although we are prepared to listen to the concerns you expressed , we must also listen to the other legitimate concerns .
I think we have to be careful about maintaining the neutrality of the EU &apos;s humanitarian response , even if it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas .
Furthermore , it adds new points to what Parliament had already said in the past , such as calling on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of investigations by all the parties and to come back to Parliament , recalls that the EU &apos;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of its Member States require complete monitoring of the pressure on NGOs involved in the drafting of investigations and restrictive activities in Goldstone report .
I also trust that this decision will help save fish species that are on the verge of disappearing .
I wish you to take my questions not as a provocation but as a help with reflection .
I am always prepared - and I hope it will - to go back to explain our results , but we must check what we will find .
This result will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade talks , especially in the World Trade Organisation &apos;s current Doha negotiations .
If Europe speaks with one voice , the United States of America will also pursue this goal .
For this reason , I personally support the prices set for European tobacco plants , at least as long as smoking continues to be consumed .
Looking at the initiatives taken by various Member States , it is quite clear that some countries take the most seriously than others .
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) separately from European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to overcome the expansion of treatment , and two thirds of the people who needed to be treated in 2009 have still not received it , meaning that 10 million people in need of treatment do not have access to the necessary effective treatment .
Indeed , when human dignity is assessed , we see minorities as something that is absolutely negative .
The European Commission &apos;s proposals to facilitate access to these funds are welcome .
In the future , all EU institutions should ensure that our budgets were directed towards helping citizens and businesses to overcome difficult economic periods and to plan recovery .
The only way in which these measures will be more practical and effective than measures which have been outlined is to support social initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions .
I would like to say to all those who are still opposed to this Treaty for believing , quite rightly , that it is a Treaty that reinforces the European Union , that opponents of this Treaty are actually strengthening our alleged partners or , if it wants to , our opponents .
The European Union is embracing global capitalism in an abrazy that will end us all .
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will continue to develop a network of other means of transport .
You will remember that it was an intense struggle because it came to the Court of Justice , and the Commission - and I must pay tribute to the Commission - had lucidity , rather than the Council , and we fully support the Commission .
The first person this morning asked for the floor was Mr Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the line being taken by the governments of the Member States that make up the heart of the EU , the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified .
Of course , I would like to remind the House that , according to recent consensus , there are still more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union - probably the figure has already reached 25 million today - meaning that attracting more asylum seekers is , in fact , a form of collective suicide .
Sanctions must be imposed by the Commission , not by the finance ministers .
Sri Lanka is dependent on its economic recovery of direct investments abroad and EU economic support .
We fully support the aim of this initiative , but we cannot support the reference to another vote by Parliament , among others , which is supported by abortion and which contradicts an explanation of vote in advance that we included in Parliament &apos;s record .
This document is the result of a compromise reached after long negotiations which improves the application of passengers &apos; rights , without imposing an additional burden on carriers .
It is time for life to be given to the &apos; EMU &apos; E by creating a true economic union as a final step in the integration of European economic policy .
The issue of children &apos;s rights in the framework of external relations has been of particular interest to me .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the EU has been trying for 10 years now to get rid of legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration .
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for disappearing national administrative and technical obstacles preventing the marketing of construction products in the European Union in order to continue creating a single market in this sector .
I think that if we really want to stick to the objectives we have set for our foreign policy in the treaties , we still have a lot to do before we can send Libya to migrants who are staying illegally in the EU .
I therefore support the resolution on European innovation partnerships within the framework of the Innovation Union flagship initiative and I think we should all participate in action for innovation because , as I have already mentioned , it is very important for the future .
In the UK , we have a recent election government which has made promises in this area .
The next item is the report by Mr Alves , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 247 / 2006 establishing specific measures in the agricultural sector in favour of the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255 / 2009 - .
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand with a positive result both for the environment and for the creation of jobs .
There are some countries that do not use all ESF funds that are granted to them and leave 30 or 40 % unused .
This makes me asking - even if the Commission has stated that it has the information and its publication , as there is a publication obligation - why this situation was unknown .
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
I strongly support the proposal for an effective information campaign to be conducted to increase the visibility of points of single contact .
It seems very strange that the Spanish Presidency is asking us to combat the economic crisis and to make the implementation of the objectives of economic policy mandatory .
Today , I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection , because I believe that the impasse that has been reached in the Council on account of the language issue is not justified .
I repeat : the Treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced to take on debt .
I would like to remind you of the joint agreement of the European Parliament and the Council to appoint 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
Let me reassure this House that we will continue to address these issues , including at the highest level , by remembering the international obligations of the People &apos;s Republic of China in the field of human rights .
I hope - and I am sure - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement .
Firstly , I regret that the Commissioner , Mr McCreevy , is not here ; I suppose the new cabin careers have already started .
Perhaps I am not aware of this , but there is a need for comprehensive animal testing , for example , in order to be able to verify this type of claim .
Something that untrusts me a little , Commissioner , is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of industry in the process that you have just activated here .
We do not agree with this .
EU aid planned for the 2007-2010 period aimed at contributing to the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova is more than EUR 50 million .
Of course , we cannot understand how an illegal worker accepts a job and the person who employs it to cover his or her residence and the costs of survival are ultimately punished .
I believe that this measuring system based on corroborating various policy parameters will result in more appropriate political decisions with regard to the needs of society and the economy in general .
At the same time , I would like to point out that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on , and directly related , the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and the cessation of repression on participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists .
Finally , High Representative , you are going to make a journey to the Middle East .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to explain briefly that this report contains the amendments adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development pursuant to the resolution adopted in plenary of 19 June 2008 , which rejected the Commission &apos;s proposal aimed at authorising the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption , even after being subjected to antimicrobial treatment .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concern for the four Cuban prisoners and an opposition activist who have begun hunger strikes as a protest .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) .

The Union , particularly the Mediterranean countries , has always stressed in the provision of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people , because the principle of solidarity towards the people living in this type of problematic circumstances is fundamental .
Often , workers themselves are isolated , and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation .

Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today .
However , as it is , and although some amendments have helped to improve it , Mrs Guillaume &apos;s report is a real incentive for people abuse of this process , obstructing responsible services and harming those who really need her dossier to be reviewed quickly .
The time has come for us to take responsibility for doing everything possible , and I would like to thank the authors , Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their excellent work , which benefits us all .

The so-called social dumping is a major threat to workers , as it undermines rights in a fundamental way .
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure respect for human rights in the Republic of Congo .
( EL ) Madam President , I should like to ask , with regard to what the Commissioner said about the assessment of each proposal , whether a prior study can be carried out in the area in question , also on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific nature of the area , so that there are criteria that all countries have to take into account from the outset and comply with them in their planning .
Or the problem of Roma women , who are suffering particularly from poverty , who suffer from problems of access to housing and problems of discrimination or violence , and the case of young Roma who , at the moment , are in their lack of qualifications , is even more difficult for them to access employment .
in writing . - ( PT ) I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector and thus help marginalised communities in all Member States .
It also serves to remind politicians that , in order to make freedom of the press effective , public authorities must exercise their role : they must protect freedom of expression and promote their development .
Mr President , I believe that the European Union has grown excessive , has too many cultures and I simply do not trust this system in any way and I think it is going to get worse .
It is too early to announce the results of this analysis , and as you will be aware , every step in this process requires unanimity from the Council .
It is important to point out that the EU &apos;s integration prospects serve as the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to carry out the necessary reforms and also as a factor in regional stability .
Now that advertising has an even greater role , it is essential that we lay down the criteria that enable consumers and patients to know in all detail about the stated effects of medicines .
In the words of Neil Armstrong , it would be a small step forward for European funds and a giant step forward for the European economy .
Thirdly , there are simply no loopholes in security which , time and time again , have been stated that they will occur if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement .
Furthermore , the rapid expansion of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has led to an increase in online gambling supply and the resulting emergence of cross-border issues , which remain unresolved .
All the people who make decisions in this area should have equal access to professional information about the country of origin of the applicant and the bodies authorised to meet resources , as should the people who are applying for asylum have access .
I am therefore realising , after all these years , the important step taken by the building of the only multinational parliament in the world chosen by universal suffrage .
The 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion per year on defence , and this EUR 200 billion must be used better than in the past .
Together , we have made the difference .
Moreover , during this parliamentary term , we are going to work on services of general interest .
I would therefore like to suggest that we call Mr Almunia , the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs , for example , as he was highly critical of some countries during his term of office and then the Greek problem came about .
In this regard , there is an urgent need for reforms .
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries , particularly Portugal and Spain , so we must now grant this aid to Lithuania .
Losble spent nuclear waste and spent nuclear waste ( debate )
I will just mention the most recent episodes , such as the demolition of the town of Vinh Long , which has been replaced by a public park , or the deployment of the anti-riots and bulldozers police to withdraw the Virgen Mar√≠a Bemony Statute from Hanoi .
