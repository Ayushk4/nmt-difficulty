Closure of the sitting
Thank you .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 meeting in London will be a milestone for a global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report that we discussed on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that the environment is much more environmentally damaging to imports from third countries than in the case of domestic production , which is subject to strict rules for reducing CO2 emissions , making internal production more favourable to climate change .
It is really difficult to accept that the countries to which these funds are intended to be able to use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime authorities of the Member States must work more closely together to harmonise training programmes and provide opportunities for paid workshops and exchange experience with European maritime operators .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
We have noticed that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
FRONTEX must be given support and the EU must force national authorities to assume their responsibilities .
I would like to add one small point here , apart from Commissioner Almunia , which no one has addressed so far .
The effects of climate change are receptive mainly to water stocks , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , and not least to public health .
Let me also express my personal and Commission &apos;s sadness over the death of nine Turkish soldiers and sandry as a result of last week &apos;s terrorist attacks .
Commissioner Piebalgs , I congratulate you on all your actions .
However , it is good to know that the opposition of the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and the concerns they have expressed about the quality of measures on education and training at a time when unemployment is growing and is creating problems in many EU Member States , the Committee on Budgets tabled the necessary amendments - which I supported - and increased initial appropriations ( for example , budget line 15 02 02 02 on the Lifelong Learning Programme ) .
At that time , a minority government with a totally different political spirit took power , but no one considered it to be a coup d &apos;état .
We , the international community , watched the issue of Abyei not being settled in a referendum , but it was very irresponsible for us and it could cause war to recover again in the future .
The brutal murder by two Hungarian Roma members of the Romanian affair of Mrs Cozma demonstrates to us once again that crime does not recognise borders and that the disregard of the problems faced by this community has adverse consequences .
A firm EU food policy is needed .
The Treaty of Lisbon should mark the model of new European policy , both in terms of the need to mobilise the resources of the Member States to achieve optimum results , and in terms of strategy and operational sharing , as a result of which Europe will become the political union that its founders dreamed for years ago .
That is our demand .
All of us , Hungary from the outset , have believed in the single market .
The exodus of climate change is forcing society and the economy of the European Union to adapt to a new reality .
Various countries will continue to help achieve internal stability and solve both socio-economic and ethnic tensions .
It has been an excellent thing to avoid a love for three years , and I am pleased that it is about to finish , as is still happening with short-term love .
The need for NATO to continue to remain vigilant and be supported , especially at the moment in Afghanistan , is important .
However , something needs to happen and we need to shift a stone down .
Common aspects need to be addressed in this context , such as reduced VAT rates , tax exemptions , the possibility to set a maximum level and the tax position for supplies within the EU .
Let me give you a little bit of the West Midlands : we have the largest youth unemployment rate and our automobile industry , partly because the European Union financed jobs in Slovakia , as a result of which indispensable jobs were lost from Ryton &apos;s factory .
It is important to ensure that the institutions that have just been set up do not force them to weaken or undermine the basic rules needed to reform the financial sector .
A long way !
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of research centres that can be allocated special infrastructure and exchange of useful information and data .
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I am very pleased with the idea of establishing a European Asylum Support Office because the situation in third countries , particularly Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating constantly .
Mr Severin rightly pointed out the strategic reciprocity , the fact that Europe needs strong United States and the United States need a strong Europe .
I therefore ask whether the Council can tell us how much of the flow of refugees can be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will try to waive these visa requirements in every way .
After all , it was not the food inspector or the EU Food Safety Agency that reached this point , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
We should therefore adopt our position on military capabilities with all the emphasis on soft power and prevention , in order to tackle the new action plan already in existence , but a change in the clarity of Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policy allows us to enter the era of new disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present a report this evening on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been in the Committee on Budgets for some time now .
In September , members of the Democratic Movement ( Mouvement Démocrate ) did not vote in favour of appointing José Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission , as his achievements in the previous term did not justify his re-election .
By transforming agricultural policy , we can ensure that the focus is on animal welfare , that animals live in suitable conditions for their species , and that they are strong and healthy in terms of operating according to the principle of better prevention than cure .
Now we fear that , if the scope of the directive is extended , the directive will find itself the same fate as the last attempt to introduce the &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , that the Council will block it .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians , Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the centre of the measures for economic recovery .
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States , with both deficits of which amount to more than 10 % , need to make a major adaptation to the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep these matters separate , because otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , and I believe that this is not his responsibility .
It is clear that there is also no freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from offending the incidence of wine producers who are pursuing quality policy , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise the removal from the segregation of final products and to allow misleading references to the colour of rosé wine .
Much remains to be done , however .
It is the case that jobs are disappearing from the countryside of Europe and that our food production rate is decreasing .
Let us also remember that , in addition to these institutional issues , the Swedish Presidency and this autumn will also , of course , have a bearing on the need to promote climate change and the financial crisis , and on the need for a European strategy for jobs - many important problems that need to be addressed .
Let me stress , however , that we are all aware of the need to provide a new legal basis for a number of documents on police and judicial cooperation that will allow Parliament to fulfil its role as colegislator .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs on having sidelined the ethical side , which of course falls within the competence of the Member States .
This is a good thing , because it is young people who decide the future of Europe , but , on the other hand , we should remember those who have already worked so hard on European reconstruction .
In other words , we are devising an economic recovery plan in which we are giving EUR 3.5 billion to the Energy Refugee oligarchies &apos; oligarchy , and not a single euro to the partners whose help we need to get support for the transition to green energy .
Fishing quotas and fisheries management are essential in order to avoid the total overfishing of land waters and oceans .
We wanted Parliament &apos;s resources to be increased by means of reallocation and measures to increase efficiency , and not by increasing the entire budget .
In addition , the package can show how the European institutions can cooperate responsibly and effectively in such an important area .
I believe that the method of pre-distribution , which the Commission advocates in its proposal for a recast , in other words , improving the procedures of the first instance , will allow real economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and have succeeded in reaching agreement on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to order European works from countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we do here .
All the work was useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is deteriorating clearly .
They must work hard to achieve a common language between the 27 Member States , reflect the unity of Europe and the readiness to overcome the crisis and uphold the very nature of European integration .
Mr President , I rise as Vice-President of the European Parliament on democracy and human rights and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , the money was only earmarked for two types of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions : carbon capture and storage and wind farms in the North Sea .
If the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) had been proposed to be used to assist British redundant workers , we would vote in favour of releasing this money , and if we did not , we would be criticised .
As far as the Court is concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational , but still exists in babies .
This concerns our neighbours and includes our immediate neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as remote neighbours such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Together with my colleagues in the Commission , I am extremely committed to the objective of including the issue of gender equality in all policy fields where we intend to make proposals .
Such projects will help eliminate the differences between the associations of the European Union &apos;s systems and enable the European Union &apos;s own energy sources to be used optimum in the future .
Moreover , this approach is based on principles and , in my opinion , Europe needs , above all , more principles , and is certainly one of the tasks of our Parliament .
Moreover , the FIFA has been unable to introduce advanced technologies , while other sports are in place .
After all , we can organise various training courses or seminars in which we can provide real support for accessing EU funds for rural development .
There are others who use such a policy as a pretext to justify their bilateral agreements with suppliers , which often ignore the requirements for transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
Furthermore , I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in establishing a closer relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
In particular , several Member States have made significant efforts to fulfil their obligations with regard to the Pact .
The aim of this programme is to enable the EU to respond to major social challenges , which affect all Member States and which they alone are unable to respond to , such as the ageing population , health , energy , water and food security , sustainable development , climate change and so on , and to acquire more knowledge which will allow our businesses to become more innovative and more competitive .
Although we will vote in favour of the resolution tomorrow , I still believe that there are a few irregularities in the budget , and I would like to mention the two main issues at the moment .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Csic , for his excellent work .
The discussions on global economic governance continue , namely , the issues of financial regulation and the inquiry into the outcome of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit .
However , I would like to address this slightly more closely .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional support to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
The nature of the problem lies in Europeans &apos; desire to reject more freedom of this way , which will inevitably be the result of accession .
This is an ungratifying and difficult task .
This is our number one priority .
However , EU aid is essential to ensure the independence of this country .
The Israeli Government will continue to pursue its colonisation with forced martyr , following the war crimes committed at the beginning of the year .
The evaluations and revisit by teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to become a full member of the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has five surface long-liners , as in the past .
larger budget allocations in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities , contributing to a new arms race ;
I would also like to emphasise the contradiction between the obligation of the Pakistani Government to religious freedom and its leading role in supporting the Islamic Organisation &apos;s &apos; Combating Religion &apos; agenda in the UN .
I say this now , because this is my frank opinion .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , as it ensures both equal rights and equal treatment .
In this situation , the rapid and coordinated intervention of European governments and institutions is clearly required , such as plans for the return of old cars for an appropriate reduction in the purchase of a new car , financial assistance and so on .
In my opinion , the legal basis presented is correct , but it does not seem to be very conventional with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which is more than important than the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , when the functions and powers shared between the two pillars are now being reconciled .
Mr President , congratulations or failure - that is the question .
This policy is doomed to a failure when people working in fisheries , from fishermen to retailers who sell fish to consumers , do not comply with the rules .
This expensive and inefficient speech , which is of the opinion that it is an expression of democracy with responsibility , is , in reality , a gigantic deception of voters .
This is regrettable , because we should be united on such a matter .
We no longer say that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe , where we in a sense do not care about that , because the climate issue must be more important .
The burden - the painful evidence we are witnessing - is an obstacle to economic growth not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
More specifically , this report will help clarify and simplify the processing of various air agreements and indicate which criteria to draw attention and monitor aspects .
I am voting in favour of the telecoms package , but I am doing so with a sense of dislike because I believe that there has been a treasure of the great principle of liberalising telecommunications that this directive had to achieve .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
They have a greater impact and lower cost for the taxpayer if we manage to coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive which will make it easier for Belarusians to obtain a visa for Belarusians , as well as a readmission agreement .
Let me give you a concrete example .
We are looking , for example , at bringing up children and schools .
Nor do we yet know whether the standards on the trade in legal timber that we are advocating will enter into force and work globally ; some speakers have already paid attention to this problem .
The establishment of a special financial and economic crisis committee which will analyse and assess the coordination of the measures adopted by Member States to support permanent qualitative growth is crucial .
in writing . - I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow more effective vaccines to be used and reduce bureaucratic obstacles to farmers .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for a strong , integrated EU policy .
By abstaining from the vote , I would like to express my deepest disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which was far from meeting our citizens &apos; expectations .
Late payments often cause difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need budgetary responsibility and austerity policies - no one disputes that - but we should not demand that all efforts remain in the hands of the citizens , because they are our only way to come out of the crisis in their shelf .
The US is implementing an early warning system for this .
One of these cases is my own constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy .
We believe in the Swedish Presidency ; speed things up - that is what Europeans asked for in the elections to this Parliament , and that is what we must give them if we want to see more people choosing in five years &apos; time .
This part of the text , which falls within the competence of the European Council , was discussed and accepted by the European Council .
The final consumption costs of private individuals per capita increased by more than 80 % over the last 10 years .
I believe that at the moment , it is advisable to give serious consideration to how the existing legislation can be enforced properly .
The conclusions of the summit on this matter are very vague .
To this end , it proposes drawing up common legal documents which will allow enforcement measures or precautionary measures to avoid problems in the recognition and translation of legal documents from another Member State , and a single standard form of information on the documents relating to requirements to be notified on the territory of another Member State .
I support the proposals on the 2011 budget because they have taken account of important policy areas as well as individual opinions .
The Commission can support the Member States on the basis of the funding programmes in order to cooperate at European level .
For example , the Council &apos;s conclusions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 provided for the right of Member States to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level in order to prosecute these crimes , which we are all remembering , in the case of General Pinochet - even the laws of some Member States are covered .
Thank you .
My vote in favour should not be perceived as support for the EU &apos;s subsidy facility .
We are doing our purchases ever further and the Internet has changed our habits fully - partly because our lives are becoming more and more urgent .
With regard to the information reform , we are constantly providing information as soon as we have it .
I would like to conclude by saying that the best investment is a younger generation of education , and I am thinking about lifelong education .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that these issues have been resolved in the final agreement with the Council in a satisfactory manner .
( Loud applause from the centre-left )
In this case , thousands of people have been affected , often with small children and without the necessary resources .
These procedures are completely different in terms of further appeals to the Commission under the possible future provisions of the treaty and in relation to appeals to Parliament under the petition procedure .
Human rights must be respected by both sides of the conflict in the Middle East .
Mr President , the Greek debt crisis has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the eurozone .
We all need to acknowledge our responsibility .
We understand that the UNESCO has , in any case , given dictates to the Chinese authorities on the impact of development on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - MEP Schwab has presented a report aimed at increasing the safety of vehicles , by introducing more safety requirements for car manufacturers .
That is why I voted against the report .
We were hard hit by the economic and financial crisis , but we have shown the ability to act and we have strengthened our resistance .
If we are talking about Parliament &apos;s relations with external bodies , such as human rights organisations , which may be affected by this , and if we fail to reach an agreement - although I hope this will not happen - and if specific projects remain unimplemented , I believe that Parliament &apos;s position will be supported and understood .
The Thursday afternoon sittings in this House are becoming increasingly symbolic , both in terms of the vacuum we see and in terms of the nature and nature of the topics to be dealt with and dealt with .
In my opinion , it is still unclear whether Moldova will be able to choose its own president and , if it fails to do so , the country will obviously be facing new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) began on 1 January 1999 and then introduced each other &apos;s common currency .
( EL ) Mr President , I , too , welcome the compromise that is currently under way , because it raises the issue of the democratic deficit , which has , for years , been faced with primarily by women who are helping their spouses in the area of trade or craft work , in small and medium-sized enterprises or in respect of professional professions , without any recognition at all .
Of course , our political choices are clearly different and sometimes diverse .
I would describe this as a climate right , because it is a development in relations with developing countries and a desire to present a credible proposal for financing both mitigation and adaptation measures , as well as for the way in which we are showing our will to lead the way .
I would therefore like to know what position the Commission is taking on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone that State aid was given to the banks that benefited from it , but did not make any social commitments .
In addition to the three children , I also have a baby who , at present , recovers from milk .
We are prepared to draw up technical support programmes which will complement the tough austerity measures that the Greek authorities have to survive .
We expect the Commission to do this .
As you say , we need to modernise our statistics all the time and Eurostat is involved in this .
Sometimes I wonder whether we have not learned enough about the consequences of our actions if we are not looking for a European solution to Europe &apos;s problems and whether we are trying to find something special , even if we have to deal with them collectively .
E-mails also showed that sceptical scientists have been expelled from the peer review processes in order to prevent research gaps from coming to public control .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet brought to light the very good part of the society we are fighting on so far and the very poor results .
We know where we are dealing , and the institutions must therefore be aware , when it comes to inspections , that they pose a greater risk and , therefore , that tighter controls must be put in place .
When revising the RoHS Directive , our main objective was to increase safety standards for electrical goods and electronic equipment sold in the European Union .
Prevention is carried out mainly in schools , as this social group is the most vulnerable to drug addiction .
It successfully expanded in order to reunite Europe after the Cold War , and now it must preserve what was achieved in the past and continue integration when better times return .
Many Members are waiting today for answers to their questions and for respect for them we want to keep to order .
However , those of us who were involved knew that we had no alternative that the problems in the dairy sector had to be solved and hopefully we are so far from being able to solve some problems in this sector .
Secondly , while the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provisions , we decided to abstain on the references made in this report , because we do not approve of any measures taken by family policy being decided at EU level , which is the exclusive competence of the Member States .
Finally , I believe that the next dialogues on the same subject need to be reviewed by the EUBAM Rafah mission : how it can be implemented again and extended in a way .
The Commission is therefore following the situation and acting if necessary , but I believe that we should not move beyond the limits provided by Community law , and the Commission will certainly not do so .
As we have a common idea of the future , where we have a genuine European diplomatic service which would not only be an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the financial regulation and the Staff Regulations , which were under discussion today and will be voted on tomorrow .
in writing . - Bearing in mind that there are still differences between men and women in terms of their employment rates , salaries and access to management positions , I call on Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national law .
I abstained from the vote on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
In fact , I want to try to get the Commissioner into his hands the fact that now , in the next few weeks , there will be no further progress unless those who are being sought are passed over .
We will shortly be dealing with this issue by launching discussions on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , Wednesday 20 October , the European Parliament adopted its report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
It is already being said that tax increases are needed to keep public finances in order to keep their public finances cross .
Now is the time to present our demands with a strong voice so that Christians and those who practise other religions can freely meet their religious practices .
31.5 % of women employed in the EU work part-time ( 30 hours per week or less ) and , at the same time , 8.3 % among working men are opposed to this .
I share both the prudent optimism of the Member of the Commission and the Minister , and I feel that this winter is becoming clear , but that there are still many clouds in the sky .
At the time , few of us were able to think about the scale of the economic crisis that lies ahead of us .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction , demonstrating that it is by consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent report .
This policy has become a key element of the economic recovery package , giving added value and supporting efforts to promote innovation and sustainable growth , while at the same time expressing European solidarity .
It is also a pity that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force , but it should be enforced without further delay .
In my opinion , however , this situation clearly demonstrates how difficult agriculture is - at least in our region - as farmers must stand in the winter &apos;s horror for several days in order to obtain modest sums from EU funds .
However , the Member States of southern Europe have been left with this very late .
This should be done by implementing smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
We are expressing the will of our citizens in a democratic vote , and so tomorrow is a very important day .
Admittedly , the existence of housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , and it is particularly important in a modern country of welfare , and it is vital that people have a place of chaos .
In my opinion , defining political priorities means investigating them and being transparent and democratic .
This project is about implementing the Rail Traffic Management System .
( HU ) In recent months , in Northern Serbia , in Vojvodina , there has once again been fear of the attitude of many nations living there , mainly among Hungarians .
The text on which we are voting today has resulted in a compromise that was sometimes difficult to achieve , and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved a real and feasible result on our behalf .
in writing . - We agree with those parts of the proposal on equal treatment of Parliament in relation to access to meetings with the Commission and with regard to information and regular discussions with the President of the Commission , with regard to the citizens &apos; initiatives , with the inflexible impact assessments of the legislation and the use of non-binding legislation ( instead of the law ) , while we disagree with the deadlines and deadlines imposed by the European Union in order to transpose the directives ?
You all know that there can be no broadcasting without access to radio spectrum ; EU policy must guarantee non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum for all market participants .
It contains a general and quite comprehensive framework for the Commission &apos;s activities to develop equality between men and women in the areas that my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to other things where it is important to ensure such equality .
We look forward to other political and economic heavyweights also coming forward with proposals that many of them have not made up until now .
Dementia , and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular , are not only complex medical problems , but also a very sensitive ethical and social problem which continues to make the ageing of the European population more difficult .
I would also like to point out that you have put a great deal of effort into stressing that we should not confuse different areas of responsibility , and I certainly do not want to confuse Member States &apos; responsibilities and the areas of responsibility of the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for dealing with this problem : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have stretched our helping hand with the full support of all the European institutions , and I ask Minsk to accept this , because both he and the Belarusians have a lot to gain from it .
We must closely monitor what is happening , because the President said that the businesses of the European Union would achieve savings of EUR 38 billion per year .
Now , following the decision against Mr Xiaobo , we have seen the police ban even the gay of homosexuals , which is clearly threatening to end with a political residual period for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your message to Ukraine today was very clear .
We need to realise that all this can only be done with the involvement of parliaments , because the majority of the regulations can only be adjusted appropriately via the parliaments , and that this process and the proposals relating to the dialogue of transatlantic legislators and the transatlantic assembly are of paramount importance .
Someone spoke of helicopters .
Mr President , Commissioner , it was very good to see and listen to you here .
This is what I would like to emphasise with regard to this agreement .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today the European Parliament is sending a strong signal to women who are helping their spouses in self-employment .
Anyone who has visited Gaza since the conflict can testify to the huge suffering of people .
( ES ) Mr President , strategically , relations with the United States are most important for the European Union .
I must say that our ambition is to achieve a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that the EU cannot act with more and less money .
At the same time , I hope that the large number of participants of the Copenhagen Summit will be a success story for so many allies .
Mr President , I want to take the floor to support the motion for a resolution , because Mr Schulz said something that I believe to be very important : if we really want this debate to include Europe , and not just Italy , then there is no point whatsoever in voting on a resolution that carries &apos; freedom of information &apos; in Italy .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
Parliament recommends that the Council approve and not delay the regulation , because the new regulation would simplify the management of procedures and ensure equal treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the EU in the area of social security .
This is a rather striking figure , and I mentioned this in the report that I drew up in the previous parliamentary term .
But perhaps EU Arctic policy is not even as bizarre as the appointment of Baroness Ashton , a former students &apos; activist , Sarah Palin , with highly unsuitable qualifications .
One of these achievements is the FTA signed on 6 October with South Korea , the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union , and must become the benchmark of our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe it is necessary to reduce , and their position represents a weak starting point for the negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , we have attached too little importance to the development of completely new types of cars - cars which use hydrogen , batteries or fuel elements .
After that , everyone will go their way .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner in Thailand , the European Union is ready to support the country within its capabilities in this difficult process .
In order for the derogation , which should allow jobs and wealth to be created , to be genuinely beneficial to local populations , without harming the EU &apos;s fishing effort and canning industries , it was necessary to assess the impact of this derogation quickly and , if necessary , to eliminate it .
This is what the Commission and the Council are doing in a very positive way today to ensure that the gas flows can get back to their kidnappers as soon as possible , and threatening legal measures is not , of course , a particularly effective one .
The Member States must certainly immediately investigate serious human rights violations against Roma women , punish perpetrators of the actions and ensure that all victims are identified and offered compensation .
( LT ) Mr President , this is a rather complex issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with the national supervisory authorities , but also - and this has not been said - the importance of cooperation between the national parliaments and , in particular , the European Committee on Budgets , the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I would suggest to you that the European External Action Service , now that it is introducing its rules on access to information and documents , is a modern institution that is accessible to citizens and which does not treat foreign policy as if it were the administration area of some secret diplomacy .
All countries are now changing their economic policies with the aim of tackling the disadvantaged economic situation as quickly as possible and achieving at least some kind of economic growth .
Let me also speak a little to the people of Japan .
In response , President Barroso declared that this was an internal matter .
That is why we believe , among other things , that they should not be undermined , but should be maintained and promoted .
It is no secret that our sources of European identity stem directly from Christian traditions .
Although this will benefit large corporations , it will shift public transport and cause a downward situation in the network and safety .
On the other hand , Turkey &apos;s debate on future EU accession cannot remain one-sided .
This risk must be managed effectively and - as the dramatic events in Japan remind us - quickly .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of sharp injuries caused by medical or acute movements .
In short , I can conclude this report this evening , but the work is far from complete , either for me or for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and to stress that my group took a rather cautious approach to agreeing to SIS II from the very beginning , given the many data protection problems that are involved .
Proper conditions must be created .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints against 3406 in 2008 , which represents 9 % decrease .
The European Court of Justice also clearly rejected , in its October judgment , forced retirement from retirement age .
There are also considerable opportunities to use EGNOS and GNSS in areas of safety and the environment , and to promote a smoother flow of road transport through their availability to collect road tolls .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for almost a third of the budget , the situation is old : it is the only budgetary area with an estimated error rate of more than 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting this report , which has received a majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The objective behind the proposed transition to a green economy as a way out of the crisis , that is , energy , broadband Internet and innovation , is to direct large companies into new profitable sectors , and not to protect the environment and meet grassroots needs .
I therefore share your concerns that such important objectives during the Hungarian Presidency may be distorted by discussions or by national peculiarities rather than by factors that unite us .
I agree that reimbursement in cases that are justified and pre-determined , that is , when within the framework of cross-border healthcare services , the patient must remain at least one night when it requires the use of highly specialised and costly medical equipment , or when it involves a special risk for patients or the population , to be left with a prior authorisation .
It would have been , and is , the most important thing for us , as a leader , to strive for an even more ambitious reduction target of at least 30 % .
The abuses are particularly damaging to those who are making real efforts to alleviate environmental damage .
The previous visa scanners , of course , show the relaxation in some countries &apos; approach to issuing visas .
The impoverished population of rural areas , which most need funding , has to cope with it once again .
I know that you are able to rise to these challenges .
- President of the Czech Republic , I welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr Orbán has not presented himself to the political groups in the European Parliament as a European politician who is trying to find a consensus and reach a compromise , but who is a fighter and wastes his populist and nationalistic statements and who defends the Hungarian people from attacks .
As rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I therefore see this report in a positive light and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to build a nuclear bomb .
I completely reject the idea of a preventative bombing of the US , as well as NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for European stability .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is a very important piece of work which will enable us to put in place a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe in the new financial framework .
With this in mind , we are committed to creating the necessary conditions so that the fisheries sector becomes fundamentally sustainable and can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions are tough in the Arctic region , but there is also no doubt that new technology and new advances will inevitably be more exploited in the area , such as fisheries , for example .
The unemployment rate among young people has exceeded 20 % in the early year due to the economic crisis and , at the same time , the school drop-out rate has exceeded 17 % , with the most significant impact on young people in rural areas .
Today , the market for environmental labels , curiots and texts has been very widely included , which may confuse consumers , from foresting to arguments for neutral carbon dioxide , and even ecological cars , from forest pilots to dangerous substances .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it has been suggested that European countries , not third world countries , were responsible for the departure of third world countries themselves .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for wasting all the time and postponement of the South , but I will do so only once in 10 years , so perhaps you will not make it bad .
It is a delicate piece of work , a work designed to change things for the better , and it has simply not experienced enough to do so .
Just last year , we agreed to repeal these rules , and while consumers have not noticed much differentiation , our producers have still noticed and marked plans .
I believe that the proposals made in the package are not ambitious enough , as they only lead to restrictions on austerity and citizens &apos; social rights .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) budget to be cut , because that would mean that agriculture would probably be less worth .
At the same time , the early closure of such a huge installation , which is intended for economic calculation , leads to huge direct and indirect costs .
So I really want to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the compromise that has been negotiated .
The President of the Republic of Latvia , Valdis Zatlers , is a great honour in welcoming you today at your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the charter was cleared up .
If there is an agreement with the third country through which illegal immigration can take place , and there is a readmission agreement , which we are aiming to conclude , which will make the European Union &apos;s agreements with this third country more secure , which , in turn , is the overall starting point and logic of the European Pact on Immigration - it will mean that the borders of the Member States of the Union will be strengthened .
We regret the fact that the report does not fully take into account our proposal , but we welcome the fact that the report does reach a very similar conclusion to that of ours .
Given that the new Commissioner for Agriculture has set the task of promoting a more competitive agricultural system in the global open trade environment , I will use the presence of the Commissioner to ask him how she will see cooperation with my colleague in charge of agriculture in concluding the negotiations with the Doha Round .
This report proposes the simplification of financial supervision and control and the strengthening of scientific technical evaluation on the basis of peer reviews based on excellence .
The proposals put forward here today should be looked at , analysed and understood with this in mind .
The legal and administrative obstacles , such as the status of a legal personality , financial rules and , in certain cases , intellectual property , which may prove to be an obstacle to the participation of many important research players and SMEs , also need to be stressed .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission is reviewing Directive 2007 / 52 on the basis of the aspects that it has just listed .
That is why I voted in favour of the provisions stressing corporate social responsibility .
We can see that progress has been made on the new point , that is , on transparency , and that , in the case of new regulations , access to documents , there is a decrease in the possibility for applicants for infringement proceedings and launching infringement proceedings to find out why proceedings have been completed or started .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) As my colleague , Charles Tannock , has already mentioned , this is not the first time that we have ever debated the appalling human rights situation in Burma in this Chamber , which is unfortunately always half an hour empty .
Therefore , the aim of society is to work so that women and men can freely choose between these two logic options , which , from the broader perspective of their work alone , justify their existence .
Nowadays , it contributes to the consumption of low-nutritional products , leaving thousands of livestock farmers in distress , who are unable to market their produce in a country that produces 50 % of the produce they need .
The full impact of the current situation on our bank portfolios and the development of our businesses cannot be envisaged firmly at the moment .
Within the framework of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is just as important as it is in the past and perhaps even more important than ever .
Fossil fuels make the distribution of energy centralised , hierarchy and inflexible .
In this respect , I share the views of my fellow Members .
( HU ) Mr President , the Hungarian Presidency has reached half way , so it deserves a reputation for what has been achieved to date .
I believe that the revision of the first railway package must identify the problems faced by Member States that have received reasoned opinions from the Commission along with the method for resolving them .
Israel does not understand that such a wide-ranging military response encourages the emergence of new suicide bombers and results in the firing of new Karians as soon as possible .
The Burmese authorities have chosen to ignore the imprisonment of protests Aung San Suu Kyi and have called for her release , as has been done by a number of states and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , ASEAN Secretary-General , and a number of ASEAN Member States , of which Burma is one .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Sabin Cutaş , pointed out that the EIB &apos;s operational safeguards in the EU budget represented almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009 , which is even a huge amount for the EU , and I therefore think that Parliament is absolutely right to demand clarification on the risks of this obligation .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved the project , but on behalf of Mr Soini , and also of myself , I would now like to identify the location of the information relating to this project that all the citizens of all the Baltic States need before the construction work begins .
Without the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would never have been realised .
I believe it is important to conduct an information campaign on this issue .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to provide the people of Kosovo with control over the documents that prove the identity of Kosovo .
Measures have also been taken in this area and clear and precise rules have been introduced .
Are they in favour of Mr Corbett &apos;s understanding of a federal state - the United States of Europe - or of a freer vision of a Europe based on free trade agreement supported by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the substantive report that we are presenting today .
This is not impunity ; it would be impunity to continue as has been happening for many years .
A person of great many good characteristics can rarely meet .
I firmly believe that all the people of Slovenia agree to the immediate conduct of these stress tests in Krškos .
The fact that some Member States do not want the employment summit to be held on Tuesday is not good .
We have seen that much has been done to meet the criteria , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to meet all requirements as soon as possible .
If we allow the Moldovan Government to force the population to finance uncertain European programmes and agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the new European ATM System ( SESAR ) , given that Moldova is not even a Member State of the European Union - this seems rather cynical .
In this way , we would kill two birds with one stone because this infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and give jobs and , at the same time , alleviate the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Hank-Mansic , it was agreed that our common goal was to conclude a strategic agreement that will constitute a detailed framework for further relations between the EU and Russia and help to make use of the potential of relations between us .
It is now clear that we do not have enough requirements for the Mediterranean and , in particular , for the Libyan issues - we need to think a little more about it and admit that perhaps we need to act more forcefully to understand what has happened and to implement coordinated action in the Mediterranean area .
A significant source of funding for this line from Europe relied on the support of the local population for the project and on the private investment in Italy .
( SK ) Mr President , for a week , reports on the accession process were published in the Balkans .
We have therefore abstained from the vote on the proposals for matters relating to the TV1 of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , although , as we know , the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of the situation in Portugal .
The proposal by the Committee on Development was to establish national reporting procedures so that transnational corporations should be accountable on a national basis .
The key issue mentioned in the report is the problem of prostitution and the trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to the completion of the Tribunal &apos;s work , this does not even happen with the arrest and justice of Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the damages claims against those businesses that are responsible for the fuss of farmers , as a result of which these farmers were informed of their harsh and toxic effects .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use ICT to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and the competitiveness of European industry .
For us to be able to find solutions , we must use the same approach in the future .
However , you know that our message is structural reforms ; structural reforms to increase Europe &apos;s potential for growth and create European jobs are absolutely essential .
This partnership can be particularly important at a time of global financial crisis such as the present one , and it is possible to open up more opportunities for trade and cooperation in the field of research and technology , enabling us to be a stronger and more stable position when we come out of this crisis .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
in writing . - Approval and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the associated administrative burden have increased Parliament &apos;s responsibilities .
As a result of this unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort must be made to prevent the number of unemployed or unemployed poor in Europe from reaching 25 million in 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I , along with four of my fellow Members , have presented , and which was approved by one of the Members of the European Parliament , in order to oblige the Council and the Commission to comply with legislation that is truly effective in combating corruption .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , President Buzek , our group fully agrees with your programme on Parliament &apos;s governance in the next five years .
On behalf of democracy , let us allow them to implement the commitments made .
We believe that it is through these dialogues that we can help these countries , particularly through increasing the participation of civil society .
Although , as a socialist , I believe that , in this case , Sri Lanka does not offer a solution , the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against the repression by the military .
It is time to support the creation of simpler and less costly measures for SMEs , which will provide an opportunity to create more jobs and achieve greater growth .
In the fight against this , it is very important to adopt uniform safety elements in the European Union , including in the context of the repackaging of medicines .
When we talk about common requirements , the issue of the US and its experience and drastic incidents always arise .
The rapid entry into force of the agreements between the European Union and the United States of America on extradition and legal assistance would give impetus to cooperation in the field of criminal matters and contribute to the removal of this &apos; bad zone &apos; , which made it possible to make extraordinary transfers .
I have three proposals , and I would like to emphatically ask for your support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has been asked several times to decide , in some specific cases , whether sport is a service that is purely beneficial to society or , on the contrary , whether it also includes an economic aspect , which means that it is a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is the highest priority of this institution and citizens need to know that .
Only time will show whether this will be a marginal problem or whether it will prove to be overweight the undeniably positive impact of this directive .
By updating the logistical nature of freight transport and promoting combined transport - combining optimum between the different modes of transport in the same transport chain - we can improve the well-being of the Baltic Sea area .
It should be up to the Member States to decide whether or not they wish to ratify this ILO Convention in the course of a democratic procedure .
According to Eurostat , a minimum income from EUR 123 in January 2011 in Bulgaria and EUR 157 in Romania reached EUR 1758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text adopted once and for all will not prove so poor .
The Copenhagen Summit was , in many respects , disappointing .
We ask international donors , both national and non-state , to finish their activities in certain areas if this bill is adopted .
It is a barrier to the legal protection of individual rights and a point that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe is the country of our countries .
Therefore , when I speak Hungarian as a Slovak police officer , they will have to answer me in Slovak , even if their mother tongue is Hungarian and despite the fact that I do not understand their answer .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like once again to discuss one aspect of transatlantic police and judicial cooperation in connection with Swifs , which has already been mentioned here , that is , the transfer of bank data to the US .
In 2009 , we observed an alarming rise in the use of various forms of public protection , both in individual EU Member States and in new emerging economies .
In the case of SWIFT , neither the Commission nor the Council have taken the transparency seriously .
Finally , the political frontline is important for us to achieve Union with ACP countries within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
We need to do something else .
If we can bring together a child without parents and abandoned , and the family that wants children has been important .
As this is an important step towards the success of the 2020 strategy , I would like , in particular , to talk about the importance of the EU &apos;s various institutions ceasing to compete against each other , as well as about making serious cooperation with regard to instruments without which the objectives of the 2020 strategy can be achieved .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The horrific events in Gaza should also force us to look at the region from a more strategic and long-term perspective .
It is necessary to develop other indicators which will help to clarify what factors will affect the country &apos;s standard of living .

rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package is composed of four draft resolutions aimed at implementing the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Mr President , the European Parliament &apos;s image is also at stake in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
In the global context , and in a period of economic and financial crisis , the European Union is being called upon to strengthen its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , strive to pursue its interests and protect its citizens , developing a common vision of the main challenges and threats , and adapting its capabilities and resources to respond adequately to them , while making a contribution to international peace and global security .
This is a good time in the relationship between the two parties , and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This is a step towards greater transparency in the institutions of the European Union , and I hope it will contribute to greater legitimacy of European integration among European citizens .
I urge you to look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a preventative approach .
the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on the strengthening of surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
If we want to successfully resolve these problems , we must take strong and decisive political action .
Mrs Ronzull , I will say this to you for the last time .
I would like these exemptions to be subject to a definite time limit or to a defined benchmark analysis , without the structure of which the Commission might consider which proposals to submit , so that India &apos;s demands can be met at least to a certain extent .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I have heard how the facts are really waived towards the Italian Prime Minister , but the fact that , thanks to its business activities , it is giving employment to tens of thousands of people .
Whether cooperation is timely or not is , of course , something that Parliament itself should consider .
This report therefore highlights the importance of one of the few well-known programmes and , at the same time , calls for changes to be made to simplify the rules on administrative and financial instruments , as well as to ensure that national research and scientific research results are still far too accessible to SMEs , at a time when it is still better equipped and better coordinated between the various European research groups .
The ECB is not independent ; it has chosen half .
This does not mean that our industries will become uncompetitive .
He called for the introduction of a global ban on &apos; body scanners &apos; .
According to statistical statistics , diseases of cardiovascular districts in Europe cause approximately 4.3 million deaths every year , with more than 1.7 million deaths .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective health instrument to protect Europeans from infectious diseases , and it is also important for health care to reach developing countries and to help extend life expectancy and combat poverty .
Therefore , with a loud vote , we must say that the fact that the new rules in the euro area are being exploited by the banks to increase their revenues at the expense of our citizens is absolutely reprehensible .
In the current economic situation , too , we must ensure that the costs are under control here in the European Parliament .
This is why I believe that enhanced protection of rights for industrial owners , including patents , is important for European competitiveness .
He was a very important person , because he followed all the Supreme Security Court trials in the country and made regular assessments of Syria &apos;s detention conditions .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
It appeared then that each new Member State would respect the fundamental principles of the EU and the ban on discrimination and would defend and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
In addition to credit , social credit has also dried up .
These new measures would enable European citizens and businesses to protect their rights , particularly with regard to the right to recognition of qualifications and social rights and residence in the country .
The issue of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a one-off issue .

The fact is that men have the right to be fully involved in the first few days after they have arrived in the family .

In practice , we need to break our total dependence on Russia &apos;s energy supply here in the EU .
( RO ) Mr President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 11st trading partner and trade relations between the European Union and Canada account for 1.6 % of the total external turnover of the EU for 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to mention that the rapporteur who inserted this into our Rules of Procedure was Mrs Renault , not myself .
The country &apos;s own fisheries sector is still completely undeveloped .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report on behalf of the PPE Group .

This regulation clarifies the rules for cabotage , which apply - and I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - throughout the EU uniformly and in an unbureaucratic manner without affecting existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the agreement .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama has said that the Chinese representatives can familiarise themselves with the archives of their government in exile in order to make sure that they have not fuelled violence .
This is their response to a problem that has prevented them from development and integration with the rest of the world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
We hear in the media and also in this House every day the numerous demagogic statements that have no special basis .
As human rights are among the main aspects of the agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the exceptional , unilateral trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
That is why I voted for the directive on the energy performance of buildings because it is expected that it will have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , since it will involve directly the buildings in which they live and which they will use .
Amendment 9 introduces temporary , but unacceptable , exemptions from the principles on which the European Union has been established , including four fundamental freedoms .
In our opinion , however , it is unacceptable for this House to use it as a justification for demanding a larger budget .
It is time to end this unilateral privilege given to the United States .
Mr Dalli , Mr Dalli , ladies and gentlemen , I would be pleased if , now that we have a directive in place , you could focus more closely on the regulation on social security , which is the system on which everything is built , making it clear who is paid and where everything is well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common objective and let us work with the Arctic countries and the international community to find the best and most effective way of maintaining and protecting the Arctic on behalf of future generations .
I believe that this was very necessary , and it is a good example of the achievement of the European Parliament in drawing up the budget : the funds that were not unused in other areas are now being mobilised .
Let us now look at the hypothesis .
In order to do this , however , we must do everything possible to limit the energy efficiency of economic activities in all areas .
In sensitive sectors such as the clothing industry , skin goods and furniture industry , the major problem with creating conditions for consumers to make informed choices is precisely those companies that chose to continue production in Europe and to maintain European knowledge and jobs .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for decades , the international community has failed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument that has strengthened the EU &apos;s relations with third countries and has brought tangible benefits .
However , this is not just about you .
In this respect , the Commission has not only the right to express its opinion , but also the duty to do so .
However , with this draft document , we have removed this obstacle and done so , because we need to look after the patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance and the urgency of these proposals .
I believe that every patient has the right to high quality health care offered in their mother tongue close to their place of residence , where a family is on the table .
Speaking in the European Parliament , the names that everyone has agreed on must be used , and the candidate country has agreed to use the name &apos; Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos; and not Macedonia .
This can be achieved and would bring about better results .
The latest developments in the European economy , including Greece , have shown that there is an urgent and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
To keep up , their donor Stuart Wheeler has said that the cost of membership is GBP 120 billion per annum - 36 times higher than the actual cost .
The dual approach to Belarus - &apos; carrot and carrot &apos; tactic , as Mr Tannock I suppose called it - will hopefully be a success .
We could talk for hours to come about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation or other issues - but I think it is important that in the three reports that have been submitted today , we have basic agreement on what we have recently done .
Secondly , he said that the Commission should start looking at the possibility of Eurobonds - I would say at last .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
Europe does not need credibility of this kind .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
According to the regulation , tyre suppliers must use labelling and websites which will provide users with information on fuel consumption and rolling stock , wireless grip and external rolling noise .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also believe that the European Union should play a more courageous and far-reaching role in its efforts to achieve a final phase in the COP 16 negotiations by allowing its chief negotiator to act flexibly in order to respond to the progress made during the negotiations .
Therefore , the necessary balance and transparent measures are needed , as achieving the confidence of businesses is a prerequisite for the success of the project .
There is a problem with the devastating impact of urban building , particularly in coastal regions and in Spain , as well as in other regions such as the Madrid environment .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia follows the situation very carefully , working closely with the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the European Commission .
These processes should include the necessary post-closure corridors , the processing , storage and cleaning of waste , the modernisation of equipment in accordance with environmental requirements and support for the replacement of the energy capacity of decommissioning facilities , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I believe that this would be the case .
I come from a country where , every time I go to a trademark , I see a motto travelling man with a motto who has such timber .
For example , there was talk of the sale of fertile land in developing countries and of countries where there is no educational land ; purchasing them is , in itself , a very interesting topic of debate , and I think that we can also reach a common understanding on this issue .
However , without the trans-European networks , the most important objectives of the European Union cannot be achieved .
The 27 Member States of the European Union are growing tobacco in 17 Member States , and the governments of these countries are providing subsidies to tobacco growers .
Automatic legal protection throughout the EU is guaranteed in one of these three languages - English , French or German .
This is a very controversial issue in Ireland and water for those who are in favour of voting against the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency did its best to reach an agreement , but ultimately decided that the European Council must decide on this matter .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny our opinions from time to time .
That is the way the Commission will work .
Hopefully , this was a one-off case with regard to the repatriation of the agency in its final location .
The proposed amendments will also allow the less developed countries , including Romania , to qualify for the fund &apos;s assistance .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear Members from every corner of this House praising the Belgian Presidency - rightly so .
These two aspects are difficult to prioritise in the current situation .
Together , we are working to bring an end to the Doha Development Round with a positive outcome by 2010 , as it is extremely important for economic recovery and the fight against protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a somewhat special day for me because , after 10 years of good and loyal service , it was my last session as President here in Brussels .
I also think that , in terms of increasing efficiency , there is an interest in the proposal for these delegations to take on certain consular tasks , such as processing Schengen visas .
It seemed that , instead of discussing with other countries , we have wasted every day taking time away from our discussions and , in the end , we could completely defeat .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s draft must be better prepared , so that Parliament should take more time to make a decision .
Perhaps it is intended to go further than what is currently being proposed .
Without this protective shield , all Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation .
As a social democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress towards the expansion of overall education , the reduction of poverty and access to clean drinking water .
This morning President Barroso said , keeping in hand with the Treaty of Lisbon , that it was the Commission that speaks on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
There may be opinions , there may also be differences of opinion , and even Eurosceptics are allowed , but the final outcome must be the same .
Lukashenko has succeeded in using the partnership programme as a political player , enjoying all the political and economic benefits and , at the same time , continuing to reduce democracy and human rights .
In turn , the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude local border traffic agreements between Russia and their neighbours in the European Union , which are interested in this .
This is important for the future of European citizens .

We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must acknowledge that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything in our power to ensure that waste is properly recycled , not only with the aim of preventing environmental and health damage , but also with the aim of reducing the loss of raw materials .
Let us not forget that an international arrest warrant has been issued for Omar al-Bashir , which is ignored by the authorities in that country .
It also confirmed in its letter the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of the work of the project and its preparation has begun .
Mr President , I expect you to respond to this by way of order .
As regards the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal essentially makes sense as it concerns the prohibition or the gradual replacement of such products , which have a very negative impact on human health .
The aim of this proposal for a decision is to determine the fishing opportunities offered to European Union vessels on the basis of the excessive resources available , as well as the separate financial contribution granted in terms of access to resources and of sectoral support .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe that it is right and appropriate to translate Taiwan into a positive list .
Regrettably , even in democratic societies , these traditional means of communication often send out a failure caused by commercial interests or by their management belonging to a specific political million and , indirectly , oblige their workers to engage in self-censorship .
We cannot coexist in the European Union until this situation continues , and therefore we believe that it is very important that we put forward proposals at the same time to bring this situation to an end .
I also intend to keep an eye on some social , environmental and economic criteria , as I am committed to prior evaluation of all legislation .
That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds .
Commissioner , it is good that we are talking in the European Parliament about Belarus , but talking only about it is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support the motion and speak in favour of it .
I welcome the consideration being given to transforming East Jerusalem into the capital of the future Palestinian state or the appointment of Jerusalem as the capital of both countries .
The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be prepared .
However , even in the same Member State , there are very different regions .

The Food and Veterinary Office also found major shortcomings in Brazil &apos;s traceability system and problems with the many islands that were moving towards the European Union , but without the necessary certificates .
Their representatives will now speak one after the other .
Therefore , I believe that the most important question now is how and what could we further build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency ?
The role of the European Union must be strengthened in the aftermath of this crisis .
At the heart of the proposal under discussion is the requirement for dialogue to be reciprocal and the opinions expressed to be heard and respected .

Mr President , I support Mr Daul &apos;s observations .
The resolution adopted today emphasises the fact that the establishment of a common register will ensure the widest possible participation of all categories of participants , while respecting their different or specific identity .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to put a question to the President of the Commission : he has been very busy with the situation we have seen in recent weeks in the Mediterranean , namely , how many people are fleeing the circumstances that have arisen in African countries , with some failures .
However , this will not happen , the sad example of which is the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel is bombing and destroying ghettos .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the CAP and global food security is important .

It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this respect , our Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has tabled an amendment calling for the full and immediate disposal of all export subsidies , of course , not only in relation to Europe , but also to the United States , as the Commissioner knows .
Most participants in the debate stressed the need to change the emphasis of the common agricultural policy , focusing on the competitiveness of European agriculture , the response to climate change , food safety , quality requirements and other environmental objectives .
In addition , we believe that the negotiations on the EU-Central America agreement should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , of the utmost importance for the European Union to increase specific urban subsidies , because cities are the main opportunities for the economy and finance , but cities have suffered particularly hard as a result of the crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the European Court of Auditors is officially presented only next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control .

Only the absorption of the accession process , which is the main part of the accession process , will make the governments of these countries focused on these work and reforms , which will ultimately fix the stability and prosperity of the Western Balkans .
I will focus on two reports given their importance .
For the sake of legal certainty in all concerned , we must have the same rights throughout Europe as those responsible for crimes , and these rights must be given compulsory information .

I am referring to the Rule here , supporting Mr Weber .
I also appreciated the positive assessment in the proposal of the continued efforts of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened today in Greece does not turn out to be naïve a few hours ago , and I hope that it will mark - contrary to the unanimous effort to build a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have been in constant contact with the Tunisian and Egyptian people , with our delegations , whom I congratulate for everything they have had to do in the last few weeks ; we have also been in direct contact with government and services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this instrument will become even more important in the context of the financial crisis , as it will help businesses to recover more effectively from the crisis and may be a pilot project for creating an energy fund in the future .
Supervisory supervision was insufficient .
Then we can provide Europe with a huge amount of money , but not a bottom-up hole .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament &apos;s proposal for a recommendation to the Commission following its complaint 676 / 2008 / RT on the excessive delay in providing an answer to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
Important progress has been made compared with the existing legislation , it will be possible for patients to choose their healthcare provider and to have access to information on the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I would reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly and also to review the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund with the aim of adapting them to the demands that are emerging from this tragedy .
Following consultations with organisations and representatives of the business world who stand up for consumer rights , I understand that we must demand even greater harmonisation of consumer rights across the European Union .
I said earlier that all those who ask questions are bogus in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the obligation to monitor the negotiations - trade negotiations in this case - and to intervene politically , using parliamentary means such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , to keep itself informed about the negotiations .
They do not recognise the citizens &apos; contribution to social cohesion and solidarity between generations .
The real reform , however , is admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union today .
Adequate financial resources must be allocated to this , so that the EU can use existing opportunities and new sources of global competitiveness .
It is well known that , in many European countries , public authorities in difficult situations are generally delayed by paying and that some companies often go bankrupt as a result .
The G20 also made the elimination of tax havens one of the main objectives .
No such response comes from the political class .
Of course , the dollar is still the global operator that offers secure investment opportunities , but the huge burden of US debt created by allowing the rest of the world to finance the way in which the Americans live , is increasingly questionable as to whether the world &apos;s largest economic powers can keep to their promises .
We must ensure that in a free society , there are the right instruments and the right measures to fight those who want to destroy it .
For example , when Iceland was a rich country , it had no interest in joining the European Union .
This request is nothing new , Mr Vice-President .
It is an excellent tool for promoting sustainable development and for involving all , which will help to gain a very broad acceptance of activities on the ground .
However , this is a problem which exports the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions , and one which is continuing to travel to Afghanistan .
We must fight fragmentation , so I urge Commissioner Andor not to amend the European Social Fund in the regulations and not divide it , as has sometimes been suggested in this House .
Of course , when it comes to the compromise , the way is that we do not get everything we want .
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and to the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for their constructive attitude during the entire budget procedure , which also shows how good our cooperation was .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Socialist Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to point out that the negotiations are not an endless process of lasting , because then it would have been possible to move forward with more realistic options , such as a good partnership .
That is why , above all , this is an American problem , which must be solved in Washington .
Let me also say to you that we should implement the reform by making the European universities more independent and European , students and researchers open , and by creating dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The quotas that they avoid can be stored in national reserves and subsequently redistributed if Member States so wish .
Therefore , once again , I call for his International Day of the Elimination - 25 May - for the International Day of the Fight against Totalitarianism to be established , because many people who are unaware of and who have lost their lives like Pilecki in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms deserve to be celebrated .
Let me touch briefly on what we have done .
If this were the prevailing opinion in the next parliamentary term in the European Union , it would destroy the expensive peace plan drawn up after the Balkan War .
I very much hope that these will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want to compete in numerous numbers and because I want to see EMAS compete with the ISOS , but because I believe that the programme is good and can help us meet our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker answered Mr Preda &apos;s blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As many speakers have said , the vote tomorrow is very important , and I believe it will be good .

This aspect is essential to ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .

I am very aware of the complexity of the issue , Mr Kelly .
Although most countries have many economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to halting the effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .

The opportunities for obtaining these funds have therefore been increased .

For example , France and Spain are fraud rates &apos; suspiciously low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended its 2003 measures .

It is therefore necessary to set up a network of national statistical data exchange and a platform for coordinating the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view expressed by many Members that the more solidarity we are in the centre , the better European and Russian relations will develop .
With regard to freedom of expression and assembly , Syria still has a long way to go .
We still need to do a lot before we can guarantee women equal opportunities in the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate once again that the proposal needs to be reassessed so that it also takes into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers cannot be permanent .
I supported this report because I particularly wanted to highlight the risk it mentions : consumers are not getting reliable , comprehensive information about the health characteristics , components and origin of the various fishery products .
After all , history is full of examples of Western intervention , which caused more damage than profit .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and , for several reasons , is incapable of contributing to criminal prevention .
A Palestinian agreement is the main political event and , contrary to what has been said here , Hamas has agreed for the first time that the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority are its negotiating partners .
Countries are at odds and are negotiating the division of the sea .
The latter is particularly important , especially in aware of the problems of energy infrastructure which ...
In other words , an institution that has been set up to protect us from criminals - indirectly - through special training for police officials ) has been studied .
However , the transfer of power from Fidel Castro to his brother has not resulted in democratic reforms or the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency assessments are also being pointed out in any advertisement that includes information about energy consumption or which concerns the prices of products .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know about the Washington Consensus , and you very much liked that .
In this way , we would also be able to respond appropriately to the actual circumstances on the ground , which Frontex is , in any case , aware of .
I would like to conclude by once again thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive and very positive efforts , as well as the members of the relevant committees .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this matter , and I am very grateful to the Presidency for its support in our efforts to find a suitable way forward .
Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to private business architecture makes the candidate particularly suitable , as it strikes a balance between EU law and the specific demands of both the European market and the people .
To date , 1 000 lives have been victims of the conflict within 17 days .
If such measures are taken , the number of falsified medicines would only decrease and their use would become safer .
We must also learn from the Opel case that it is not yet too late to establish a coordinated European strategy for the car industry .
The motivation for these actions was that , like you , we reject our President Obama &apos;s mistaken choice between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro recommends that savings be perpetuated .
A new investigation was recently launched at the Manchester airport and now there is legal advice that the use of these machinery by minors can violate the safety and protection laws of children because of the nature of the picture .
Moreover , this money does not go directly to the artists .
In the civil aviation sector , the development and use of EGNOT landing procedures must be promoted .

in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting in favour of this report on setting up a new microfinance facility to help people in danger of becoming unemployed , setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that we have made progress in this direction with the report by Mr Vlasák , which I fully support , and I believe that this report will enable us to develop a better regulatory framework for urban issues and , at the same time , to establish measures such as regional operational programmes that can give new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue , I realised that the improvements that I had tabled on behalf of the European Parliament were necessary for fair and efficient energy markets .
In these times of economic crisis , support and encouragement for self-employed people are vital .
In short , there is no need to ask them of Brussels .
Mr President , it is clear to us and Europe , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and everyone in Europe that energy has become a foreign policy tool capable of generating disagreement or combining us , and that is why we are dealing with this issue today .
I voted in favour of this report because food aid programmes , which are being considered to extend , are the basic instrument for providing assistance to the deprived people , who are even suffering greatly from the current economic crisis in order to meet basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , are at least one national supported export credit institution ( ECAs ) and together constitute the largest source of public funding for private sector projects in the world .
Therefore , we will not be voting in favour of the report .
In taking this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
Mr Sarkozy &apos;s interior Minister for the Interior , Conseil français , established the black man , led him into the French institutions .
On this issue , I have already asked the European Commission to give its opinion and consider the possibility of creating special programmes for creating equal opportunities for women in science .

Borders between freedom and security do not stop at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that from this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the strategy in areas such as promoting social training , coaching and employment .
The costs are borne by the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
For the stability of the region , the decision to enter into dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is particularly important .
Therefore , the reactor disaster is expected every 25 years .
I believe that the extension of eligibility for housing expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF should also force us to consider other developments with a medium- and long-term perspective , be they eligible to finance certain strategic priorities or through targeted funding .
Today is the time to talk again about violations of religious rights in these two countries , this time with regard to Christians .
Climate change is one of the greatest threats to our planet .
Due to the expected emphasis on human rights , the importance of ensuring that they form part of our dynamic relationship and are part of our work .
I must also say that until now , the European Union has had no competence in regulating air traffic .
However , Europe is not supported or a medicine against the economic crisis .
I can therefore assure the rapporteur that the Commission has already committed itself to comitology and non-mandatory provisions .
I do not believe that any of the warm words that have been heard today , not least the words of the Commission , can alter the fact that the European Union is not represented in Libya , and that today it is unable even to put an end to the situation of crisis in cities or the action of Gaddafi forces .
For this reason , I firmly believe that , when the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , it will be of great benefit to EU citizens , who will have the opportunity to exercise a much greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I also hope that these measures will be adopted at the European Council meeting in order to give courage to the markets and restore the stability of the euro area , because we all , Members of Parliament or not , should be interested in it .
It would appear that , in particular , fraud is pre-accession funds .
We can be grateful and happy about this .
We therefore call on all sides to put an end to war and violence , and we call on the EU to act accordingly .
The world outside Europe is facing the challenge of energy directly .
The energy performance indicator of buildings must be presented in press selling and rental declarations .
It is important to promote efforts to increase EU investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , in boosting the development of alternative , innovative energy sources at local level and in improving infrastructure to facilitate the introduction of new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which will result in greater internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the idea of creating a rapid response instrument within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy to respond immediately and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as happened recently in the southern neighbourhood .
The fact that someone who supports Serbia here in the European Parliament has condemned the EULEX mission is , in my opinion , simply crushing .
The problem , therefore , is that you are listened to only those Members who understand the language of the speech .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that the Swedish Presidency is putting emphasis on the issues that concern our citizens , our voters - the environmental protection and climate change , the financial crisis , job creation and the fight against crime - because we need to work in harmony with those who voted for us .
The EU budget cannot , as some MEPs claim , be used to supplement national budgets in a period of austerity , but rather it must reflect the difficult situation in which EU Member States are .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty does not give the Council any power to deal with Member States &apos; constitutions .
This is not the normal situation .
You can consider me a village , but students do not always have to learn lessons , and tourists are not always present in the country only within a defined timeframe .
Is the global financial crisis that has turned into an economic crisis at the root of this situation or is we dealing with our own mistakes , negligence and inactivity ?
My second point , however , relates to the role played by the Belgian Presidency in the post-Lisbon period .
The primary aim of these regimes was , and still is , to keep together the territory of this huge country , which is living completely different nations .
( PL ) Despite the fact that several economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
This is generally the case with Japan in so many areas , but I acknowledge , for example , the right of Japan to protect its richest market , protect its growers and pay their own farmers a higher price than in the global market , and to refuse massive imports that would destroy farmers from the country &apos;s farmers , as I acknowledge the right of our countries to protect certain areas of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to talk about two ideas , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
We are therefore promoting an assessment of the situation throughout the European Union in order to predict the necessary jobs and skills , so I am determined to work on this new strategy to put social issues at the forefront , as I already told you when we discussed broader policy guidelines for the next term .
That is why , Commissioner , I am going to go straight to the point and ask you what measures - and I will use this form of misrepresentation - the Commission intends to take in the short term in order to eliminate these shortcomings .
So far , this is what we have been lacking , and our citizens remain invisible enough .
It is not of interest to citizens - and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m. )
I hope that the European Parliament will send out a strong signal by approving Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report by a very large majority , as well as by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs Muscardini , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Susta .
At the same time , Romania has advocated an open policy , one of the main objectives of which would be to strengthen NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that , in addition , everything must be done to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I am explicitly referring not only to accidents at work , which are quite frequent , but also to dangerous substances used in labour processes .
In September 2009 , the Council began to examine in depth the proposal to amend the decision on the European Refugee Fund .
At this point , it is important to take particular account of the fact that , in addition to the persistent obstacles that always exist there , hundreds and outermost regions must now face the problem of destroyed infrastructure , of people , of businesses and of agricultural property , and in many cases they cannot begin to move straight down to normal practices , especially in regions that rely mainly on tourism , as media reflection can only be reflected .
Since 11 September , we have not seen such permanent industry interrupted , which causes such financial losses , and despite the financial difficulties currently occurring in all Member States , I would call on them to support plans to help an industry that simply cannot suffer further damage .
At the same time , we must acknowledge that our risks are also rising .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that the situation in Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small , linguistic and perhaps semantic point .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You can only wish something out of the wind , but you must understand the actual situation .
Consumer organisations are in favour of binding damages for collective redress proceedings in all Member States , combined with other options , such as extending the existing alternative dispute settlement mechanism .
Contrary to the assertion of some people , the problem with the Turkish Cypriots is not a problem in Cyprus .
I would ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their country of origin without having to go to long and understandable consumer countries .
That is what should be our task .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would really like to know where those human rights defenders have disappeared , who are as happy as we do that the Western world is secular and pluralistic , but who are turning the face of shame to the Middle East , where one faith gradually takes power away from the Middle East ?
This will also be done and we will engage in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who are wasting our money are despicable , but the politicians , Mr Schulz , who are currently creating a deficit and a debt for the younger generations are just as irresponsible .
For this , I owe a debt of gratitude to the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the political groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to show results .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the issue of the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights was a good thing ; the relationship between us really was very coherent .
We should endeavour to ensure that the programmes offered give the greatest possible support to the reforms that are being undertaken in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that in all Member States there should be a point of contact to provide patients with all the necessary information about the care , procedures and the necessary documents .
In the past , we experienced all the events of the Soviet Union as ideological death , but now we are discussing trade in the conditions of full individual freedom .
Regardless of whether it is considered a private or public fund , this report deals with a very specific issue , namely the provision made by Parliament , firstly , that it has no legal basis for obtaining compensation for deficits and , secondly , that there will be no compensation for deficits .
Certainly , the credit of these people is the most expensive after Trojan Helena , for whom a thousand boats took away to settle !
Aid generating distortions of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and has a negative impact both on employment and technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a few things that I believe we must take into account in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard from several Members that we want to see a stronger vote against the Stability and Growth Pact .
( FR ) Nevertheless , I believe that we must remember what the real problem is .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
In order to show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric church , I call on all of you today to wear the Roma pronouncements in order to express your opposition to this practice .
democratic control is being sidelined because national governments are hiding behind the backs of the Commission and of the Eyux in the most basic measures , while the Commission is putting these issues onto national governments .
The new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
When the Commission had threatened to bring something to the European Court of Justice , Sweden had to allow deka-BDE to be used .
It is clear to those of us from the counties in rural areas and to those in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the situation that many livestock farmers find themselves in today is simply not sustainable .
The depositors deserve the transparent information available , which is easy to understand .
I believe that our task could be to support the people of China in creating their harmonious society .
During the vote , I supported these two mechanisms because I am convinced that , in order to increase budgetary stability in Europe and thus secure our future , we need to be demanding and ambitious .
It is also important for the organiser of the initiative - a social or non-governmental organisation - to define clearly and precisely the subject of the initiative and its objective , although not necessarily a legislative proposal must be put forward for this .
In Latvia , there is a city called Daugavs , where more than 90 % of the population is in Russian .
I would like to welcome here Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apologies , as well as the recent proposal by the Czech Government , which called for a series of measures to be taken by 31 December 2009 by the Ministry of Health to end these violations .
I supported this report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
The effects of globalisation have now remained in full shadow of the economic and financial crisis , and our moderate response is to adapt the fund &apos;s funding criteria .
This resolution recalls that Kosovo declared its independence on 17 February 2008 , as recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to develop a common approach to Kosovo with a view to its planned accession to the European Union .
However , compared with both the other institutions , the European Parliament can be seen as an example in terms of transparency , so I would not give it my top priority , because we are more open than any national parliament , both in terms of access to documents and in terms of the transparency of our meetings and the activities of Members of the European Parliament .
This was the national policy of the Italian Minister for Reform Umberto Bosnia .
The human rights observations in my region , the Asturias , and the warnings of many other organisations must be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
in writing . - ( FR ) The adoption of the resolution on the ban on the consumption of Sewage and Water is very regrettable .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and will closely monitor the ongoing investigation .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data is also not fully sufficient to determine the measures to be used to discipline Member States with the highest rate of irregularities and fraud .
( DE ) Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of achieving 20 % lower energy consumption and reducing emissions in sectors outside the emissions trading system by 20 % .
On the second issue , I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission knows that cross-sectoral action is required to control antimicrobial resistance .
Yesterday , the trialogue will give hope for a final agreement to be reached .
In the years to come , it will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 , according to forecasting future growth based on approximately 27 % .
I believe , however , that the legal basis for the proposal should be adapted in such a way that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many people are asking me , one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , what ACTA is for .
I voted in favour of this report because EU financial aid will help people who are victims of globalisation to find work and reintegrate into the labour market and emerge from the grip of the recession .
Given that the Internet is a key instrument for creating better conditions and development for citizens in cultural terms , particularly through broadcasting and audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report , and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in the field of radio spectrum and in creating a innovation and development base in the future .
Added to all this are the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and about the problems that may arise from the accession of almost 80 million inhabitants , and these factors further strengthen my firm belief that the accession of Turkey to Europe is not correct , because the principles of European unity are , above all , based on Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This means that the environment and consumers are being put at risk , because old and energy-intensive equipment that can be hazardous is returned to the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I would also like to call for a positive statement to be made to the mayor of the town , Dr Reitemann and the local council for allowing them to set a memorial target for these young men .
Thirdly , I have a great appeal to Commissioner Kroes : if we want to be proud of our major flagship project in the future , we must speed up digitisation in the Member States .
Anyone who has seen the environmental disaster in Baia Mare due to a technological error in Baia Mare and subsequent toxic cyanide emissions into water bodies , which had far-reaching consequences for the River Tisza in Hungary and also for the Danube in Bulgaria , will make every effort to ensure that something like this never happens again in the European Union .
This is a common responsibility for all : the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament alike .
In the future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year .
Secondly , the displaced persons are always entitled to return to their homes and property - as you said , this right to freedom of movement is a right to overcome separation .
I therefore agree with the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
It is important that we have the courage to convene this summit , that we invited the social partners to participate in it , that we prepare it with them in the long term - in the run-up to the working summit in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we try to come to conclusions that are valuable for the June Council .
At first reading , the European Parliament established a good basis for the correct application of the rules on the provision of cross-border healthcare in the Member States , so that patients may be able , if justified , to obtain the necessary buffer rhetoric or hospital care in another Member State , according to the established rules and courts .
This proposal was also presented in the Barnier report , but we have not reached conclusions so far .
No time can be lost .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) In distorting the fixed grotesque in reality , we are once again faced with the European Parliament &apos;s laboratory attempt to intervene in Venezuela .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a discussion document containing new data and opinions of the various groups of users on this matter , and we will be coming back to the outcome of public debate very soon .
Thank you for your participation .
I would add that the same thing is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of the detention of a person .
