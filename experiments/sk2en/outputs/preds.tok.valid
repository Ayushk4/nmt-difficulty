Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the world &apos;s response to the global crisis .
The report &apos;s conclusions on Wednesday &apos;s debate in the European Parliament highlight the fact that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much worse impact on the environment than domestic production , which is subject to stricter regulations for reducing carbon dioxide emissions , which is positive for climate change .
It is really difficult to accept that the countries that receive these funds cannot benefit from them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
Maritime institutions in the Member States must cooperate much more closely in order to harmonise their training programmes , as well as offer opportunities for paid work experience experience and exchange of experience with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of the Xynthia storm in Europe .
However , we note that our farmers are being increasingly demanding .
Frontex must be strengthened , and the EU must also press the authorities in the Member States to perform their obligations .
I would like to mention one more point which , apart from Mr Almunia , has not yet been addressed .
The areas affected by the effects of climate change are mainly water sources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , and , last but not least , the health of the population .
Let me also express my personal sadness and condolences of the Commission over the death of nine Turkish soldiers and police as a result of the terrorist attacks last week .
Mr Piebalgs , congratulations on all your efforts .
However , it is pleasing that , shortly after the members of the Committee on Culture and Education expressed their disapproval and fears about the deterioration of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is increasing and causing problems in many Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments which I supported and increased the original budgetary resources ( for example , in the case of Article 1502 relating to lifelong learning ) .
The minority government then took power , but no one thought it was a coup d &apos;état .
It is , in fact , very irresponsible that we , within the international community , have seen how the question of Abyei has not been addressed in the referendum ; it is a recipe of how to relaunch the war in the future .
The case of the Romanian Judge , Mariana Coza , who has been brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows us once again that a crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive .
We must have a strong EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to combine the resources of the Member States in order to achieve optimum results and in terms of drawing up common strategies and operations which , at the same time , will generate a political union dreamed by our fathers many years ago .
That is what we are asking for .
We are all in favour of a Single Market such as Hungary , from the outset .
Climate change is forcing society and the European Union economy to adapt to the new reality .
The various countries will continue to promote internal stability and will help find socio-economic solutions and ethnic tensions .
It was a wonderful three-year popular relationship and , as in the case of most of the short-term popular relations , I am pleased that it is coming to an end .
The need for NATO to maintain prudence continuously and for it to have support , especially in Afghanistan at the moment , is crucial .
However , something will have to happen and we will have to get things moving .
From this point of view , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , derogations from the system , the possibility of setting a maximum rate and , last but not least , the taxation of supplies within the EU , will have to be addressed .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the highest rate of youth unemployment and our car industry has been decimated , partly as a result of the European Union &apos;s financial support for jobs in Slovakia , which has deprived us of the necessary jobs at the Ryton plant .
It is necessary to ensure that these start-ups are not forced to mitigate or undermine key rules for reforming the financial sector .
Enough is enough .
We should also make it possible to create a network of research centres which will benefit from a common specialised infrastructure and exchange useful information and data .
Qimonda meets the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of setting up the European Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , is steadily getting worse .
Mr Severin very rightly pointed out that Europe needs a strong United States and the United States , once again , a strong Europe , on strategic reciprocity .
So I would ask the Council if it could tell us what these masses of refugees will mean , given the proportion that can be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will make every effort to abolish this visa .
After all , it was not the food inspector , nor the European Food Safety Authority , but the company itself that has encountered difficulties .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we should use our vision of our military potential with an emphasis on soft power and prevention in dealing with the new agenda , which has already existed once , but which has been clarified in Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policy allows us to enter a new era in the negotiations on disarmament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present the report to you this evening on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been prepared for a long time in the Committee on Budgets .
In September , the Democratic Movement ( MDem ) was not voted to appoint Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , because he did not achieve the results that would recommend his re-election .
By reforming our agricultural policy , we can ensure that we focus on animal welfare , that animals are living in conditions appropriate for their species , and that animals are strong and healthy , all according to the principle that prevention is better than cure .
Now we are concerned that , if the scope of this directive is extended , it will be copied with the same fate as the last attempt to impose &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , that the Council is again blocking it .
( SL ) I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that the politicians , the Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their economic recovery efforts .
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the US , which have deficits of more than 10 % , will have to undergo significant changes in order to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should separate these issues because otherwise , Prime Minister Leterme will have to respond to the new media law in Hungary , and I do not think it is his responsibility .
There is , without doubt , also a lack of freedom of expression .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from being an insult to quality policy scapegoating , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legalise the by-product that has arisen by mixing final products and permitting confusing references to rosé farms .
Much more still needs to be done , however .
It will happen that there will be job losses in rural Europe and a reduction in our capacity for producing food .
Let us also remember that , despite these institutional matters , this Swedish Presidency and this autumn are , of course , very affected by the need for progress on climate change , the need for progress in the financial crisis , the concern in Europe that we need a policy for job creation , a number of important things to tackle .
However , I would like to stress that we all know that many documents necessary for police and judicial cooperation will have to be built on a new basis , enabling Parliament to perform its role as colegislator .
I also very much appreciate that the rapporteurs have left out the ethical dimension that will , of course , fall within the competence of the Member States .
This is a good thing because , after all , it is young people who decide on the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we should remember those who have already made a very important contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we propose an economic recovery plan in which we are giving three and a half billion oligarchies to energy giants and not the only euro partner we need to have for green energy change .
The quotas for fish stocks and the management of fish stocks are essential in order to avoid total overfishing in inland waters and oceans .
First of all , we would like to see Parliament &apos;s resources increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency rather than the overall budget increase .
Moreover , this package could prove that the European institutions can cooperate in such an important area in a responsible , effective and constructive manner .
I believe that the assessment at the beginning ( front-loading ) , as advocated by the Commission in its recast proposal , or , in other words , improving first-instance procedures , will enable us to achieve real economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and we managed to reach a consensus on a regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want European jobs to be transferred to countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we do .
All contributions were useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is obviously getting worse .
It must work hard to reach an understanding between the 27 Member States in order to demonstrate Europe &apos;s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and to safeguard the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At the time , funds were only designated for two types of projects which were aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere , carbon capture and storage projects and wind parks in the North Sea .
If it were proposed that EGF funds would be allocated to redundant workers in Britain , we would have voted in favour of their allocation and would have been criticised if we had not done so .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the court is fully operational , but it is still at the beginning .
It concerns our neighbours and includes our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , and also more remote , such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I am very determined , together with my colleagues in the Commission , to promote the inclusion of gender equality in all the policies we will be presenting .
These projects will help eliminate the disparities between systems in the European Union and will enable further optimum use of the European Union &apos;s own energy sources .
Moreover , it is a political approach and , in my opinion , Europe needs more politics than anything else , for which our Parliament is , of course , responsible .
Then there is the matter of the inability of the Federation to introduce a technology for inspecting the doorstep , while in other sport , such technology has been introduced .
After all , we are able to organise different types of training or workshops , where we can provide real assistance in accessing EU funding earmarked for the development of rural areas .
Other Members use the absence of this policy as an excuse to defend bilateral agreements with suppliers who often overlook the requirements for transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
Furthermore , I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in establishing a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on the programming of legislative work .
Many Member States are making a considerable effort , especially to honour their commitments in relation to the pact .
The aim is to enable the EU to provide solutions to the major social problems affecting all Member States , which these countries cannot solve alone ( ageing population and health , energy , water and food supplies , sustainable development , climate change and so on ) , as well as developing knowledge enabling our businesses to innovate more and boost their competitiveness .
Although we will support this resolution tomorrow , I believe that it contains some irregularities , and I would like to highlight two of them , which I think are the most important thing .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my warmest thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will also address the issues of world economic governance , particularly in terms of financial regulation and the correct timing of the activities following the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to go into this issue in greater detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist them in their reintegration into the labour market .
The desire of Europeans no longer to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment resulting from accession remains a fundamental problem .
This is an unthankful and difficult task .
This is our top priority .
However , EU support is also essential in order to ensure the independence of the country .
The Israeli Government is continuing to colonise at an early rate after the war crimes committed at the beginning of this year .
The evaluations and supplementary visits by teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready for full participation in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has these five surface long-liners it had before .
an increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities , which will result in a new arms race ;
I would also like to highlight the contradiction between the commitment of the Pakistani Government to freedom of religion and its leadership in organising Islamic countries by promoting their programme to combat the defamation of religion within the UN .
I say this this this this afternoon because it is my sincere opinion .
I think the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , because it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment .
In this situation , rapid coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is absolutely essential , such as the introduction of recovery programmes for old cars linked to the substantial reduction in the purchase price of new vehicles , financial assistance and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is the right one , but it does not appear to be very much in line with the more than the significant entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , according to which the functions and the powers in which the two pillars are currently involved are unifying .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , that is a question &apos; .
However , such a policy is doomed to failure if people working in fisheries , from fishermen to retailers who sell fish to customers , do not comply with the rules .
The costly fruitless discussions by Parliament , which created a well-considered illusion of a responsible democracy , a huge fraud towards the electorate who sent us here .
This is regrettable , because it seems that we should be united on this issue .
We no longer say that market liberalisation and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industry in Europe , and we do not care about this in some way , as the issue of climate change must take precedence .
The long burden - and now we see its painful side - is an obstacle to economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this report will help to clarify the various air agreements and to process them as easily as possible , stating which criteria we should pay attention and which aspects we should follow in the longer term .
I will vote in favour of the telecommunications package , but I will do so with a certain amount of an unwillingness , because I believe that there has been an essential set of the basic principle on the liberalisation of telecommunications , which this directive should have achieved .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
Their impact will be smaller and the tax burden on citizens if we manage to reconcile our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for Belarusians to obtain a visa to the EU and an agreement on readmission .
Let me give you a concrete example .
Let us look at child education and school , for example .
Neither do we know whether the standards in the area of legal trade in timber that we promote will enter into force and apply throughout the world - some speakers have already raised this problem .
The establishment of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis as an authority analysing and evaluating the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to promote sustainable quality growth is important .
in writing . - I voted in favour of changing the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow more effective vaccines to be used and the administrative burden on farmers to be reduced .
I voted in favour of this report because it sends a call for the creation of strong and integrated EU policies .
My abstention expresses my deepest disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which did not meet our citizens &apos; expectations at all .
Late payments often cause problems both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary accountability and rigour , that is beyond dispute , but we should not insist that the whole effort is on citizens , because they are the only chance of emerging from the crisis and of growth .
In the United States , there is an early warning system for this purpose .
One such example is the case of my own constituent , Andrew Symeou .
We must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy together .
Immediate things : that is exactly what the Europeans are asking for by electing this Parliament , and we must give them that if we want more citizens to be elected in five years &apos; time .
Part of the text which is the responsibility of the European Council was also debated and agreed on by the European Council itself .
Private expenditure on the population for final consumption has risen by more than 80 % over the last decade .
I believe , at this point in time , that effective thinking about the proper ways to apply existing legislation should be addressed .
The conclusions of the summit are very vague in this respect .
For this reason , the proposal offers uniform instruments that enable law to be enforced or preliminary measures in order to avoid the problems of recognition and translation of instruments coming from other Member States and the standard formulation of documents relating to claims in the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support the Member States through their financial cooperation programmes at European level .
For example , the Council Decision of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 enabled Member States to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level in prosecuting these crimes , and fortunately , these decisions - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - are also part of the legislation of some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen as support for the EU in providing &apos; unworkable &apos; subsidies .
Our purchases are becoming increasingly frequent , and the Internet has now completely changed our habits , partly because our lives are becoming increasingly hasty .
As far as information is concerned , we are continually providing it with the information we receive .
Finally , the best investment is investment in education for the young generation , and I mean lifelong learning .
We would like the death penalty to be banned everywhere .
I am pleased that these issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , thousands of people , often small children , are at stake .
The procedures are completely different with regard to abortion in the Commission on the basis of the provisions set out in the future Treaty of Lisbon and intervals in Parliament through the petitions procedure .
All parties must respect human rights in the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to face up to our responsibilities .
We are aware that UNESCO has , in any case , protested against the Chinese authorities &apos; procedure for the development of the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - MEP , Mr Schwab , has proposed a report aimed at increasing car safety by introducing increased safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us deeply , but we have demonstrated our ability to act and have strengthened our resilience .
If we are talking about Parliament &apos;s position with regard to external bodies , such as human rights organisations , which could be affected by this , and if we fail to reach an agreement , although I hope that will not happen , and then individual projects will not be able to take place , then I believe that there will be support and understanding for Parliament &apos;s opinion .
These parliamentary meetings on Thursday afternoon take on increasingly bizarre proportions , both in terms of the visible low participation and in the topics and way in which they are dealt with .
I do not think it is always quite clear whether Moldova will manage to elect a President and , if that does not happen , the country will probably organise new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 1 January 1999 , the Economic and Monetary Union began when 11 Member States adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome the current compromise , because it raises the issue of the democratic weaknesses women have had to face for years when they help their self-employed spouses in the field of trade , craft , small and medium-sized enterprises and the free professions , without any recognition of their years of work .
Our political elections are , of course , different and sometimes contradict one another .
I would call it &apos; climate justice &apos; , because this is the relationship between developing countries and developed countries , and the will to present a credible proposal for financing measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change , and the way in which we show our willingness to take a course .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of the case of State aid granted to the banks which benefited from this aid , but did not take a proper social approach .
Not only do I have three children , but I also have a nut which at the moment is nothing but milk .
We are ready to draw up technical assistance programmes , accompanied by the difficult austerity measures to be undertaken by the Greek authorities .
We expect the Commission to draw it up .
As you say , we still need to renew our statistics and look at that .
I sometimes wonder whether we have not learned enough lessons from the consequences of our action yet , if we were not looking for European problems and trying to find something specific , albeit collective , to find something .
These e-mails have also revealed that scientists who were sceptical of mortgages have been excluded from the critical review process in order to prevent the detection of public control failures .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
The Internet may have made the light of this very dark section of society with which we are still struggling , and the fight is very difficult .
We know what people we are dealing with here , and the authorities must therefore be aware of the controls that they pose a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter controls .
In revising RoHS , our priority was to increase safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic devices intended for sales in the European Union .
Preventive work is being done mainly in schools , because this social group is the most susceptible to dependence on drugs .
At the end of the Cold War , it has been successfully expanded to bring our continent together and now faces the challenge of protecting previous achievements and continuing integration once better times have returned .
Many Members want their questions to be answered today , and we would like to do so properly .
However , those of us who were involved knew that there were no other alternatives and that the problem of dairy had to be solved now , and I hope that we are now on the way to solving some of the problems that the part of this sector has facing .
Secondly , while the ECR fully supports the need for provisions relating to mothers and fathers , we have chosen to abstain from voting on such references in this report , because we are opposed to any family policy dictated at EU level , which is a matter for national governments to decide on these matters .
Last but not least , I think that further talks on this subject must address the issue of the European Union &apos;s border mission at the border crossings in Rafah ( EUBAM ) : how to revive this mission and how to extend it .
So the Commission is following the situation and , if necessary , it will act , but I do not think that we should go beyond the structures included in Community law , and the Commission will act clearly only in accordance with Community law .
As our common objective is to have a genuine European diplomatic service that is not only about expanding the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations Regulation , which we are going to discuss today and vote tomorrow , is of key importance .
in writing . - Given the persistent disparities between men and women in terms of employment , wages and access to leading positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , while ensuring the full and effective transposition of its provisions into national legislation .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try to reassure the Commissioner that there will be no progress in the coming weeks before these people escape from law to The Hague .
This issue will be dealt with shortly in the discussions on the recast of the first railway package directives and the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , on Wednesday 20 October , the European Parliament adopted the report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is also talk of tax increases in the near future to keep public finances above water .
The time has come today to make demands on behalf of Christians and other religions , so that they can freely practise their religion .
31.5 % of women work part-time work in the EU ( within 30 hours per week ) , compared with only 8.3 % of men .
I share the cautious optimism of both the Member of the Commission and the Minister and I feel that the location is clarified , but there are still many areas of it .
At that time , few of us predicted the scale of the forthcoming economic crisis .
Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction and shows that it is up to consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this first-rate report .
This policy has become a key element of the economic recovery package , as it provides added value and support measures to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , so it is also proof of European solidarity .
It is also unfortunate that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force , and we very much need it to enter into force without further hesitation .
However , I think that the situation clearly demonstrates the major problems facing the agricultural sector , certainly in my region , if farmers have to wait outside the boat for days during winter months to try and secure modest sums from EU finances .
The Member States in southern Europe have long overdue to this .
This should be done through smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will in a democratic vote , which is why tomorrow is a very important day .
It must be said that housing is an absolute necessity for every citizen , especially in a modern social state .
In my opinion , setting priorities that are political means that these priorities are to be controlled is to be transparent and democratic .
This particular project deals with the deployment of a transport management system .
( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in recent months in Vojvodina in northern Serbia , there has yet again been a gap between several nationalities there , in particular , the Hungarian , soul soul fear : in 2004 and 2005 , our Parliament adopted a resolution which is the response to the physical and psychological attacks against the Serbian people in this area .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise , sometimes a difficult compromise , and it really is clear to me that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved a result on our behalf that is feasible and workable .
in writing . - Whilst we agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for equal treatment between Parliament and the Council in terms of access to meetings and information , a regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on civil initiatives , an assessment of the impact of the legislation and use of &apos; soft law &apos; instead of repressive legislation , but we do not agree with the following points : confirmation and tightening the application of the directive &apos;s binding application of the implementation of directives and composition ?
You all know that there cannot be radio spectrum without access , and the EU strategy is to ensure that all market participants have non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum .
By doing so , we are experiencing a general and adequately comprehensive framework for the Commission &apos;s actions in terms of progress towards equality between men and women in those areas pointed out by my colleague , from employment to other practices in which ensuring and guaranteeing such equality is important .
It is with tension that we expect the other political and economic powers to come forward with their proposals , which some of them have still not done .
Demension and , in particular , Alzheimer &apos;s disease are not only serious medical problems , but also extremely sensitive ethical and social problems , the seriousness of which will continue to rise in the face of Europe &apos;s ageing population .
I would also like to say that you have consistently pointed out that we should not confuse individual responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to share the responsibilities of the Member States with the responsibilities of the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs , who have tried to resolve the details of this matter : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
With the full support of all European institutions , we have given them a helping hand and please accept Minsk , because you and the people in Belarus have much to gain .
We must closely monitor what is happening , because the President said that European companies would save us EUR 38 billion a year .
Now , following a verdict against Liu Xiaobo , we have even seen the police prevent homosexual action taking place , which is in danger of resulting in a political split period in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today was very clear .
We must be aware that this will only succeed if the parliaments are involved , because most regulations can only be adopted appropriately through parliaments , and that this process and proposals in relation to the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of fundamental importance .
Someone spoke about helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I was very pleased to see you here and to listen to your speech .
That is what I would like to emphasise in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament is sending a clear signal today to women who are assisting their spouses in self-employment .
Anyone who was after the Gaza conflict can confirm the huge suffering of the population there .
( ES ) Madam President , from a strategic point of view , the relationship with the United States is the most important one of the European Union &apos;s relations .
I must say that our ambition is to reach a political consensus at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot work more and better with less money .
At the same time , a large number of participants in the Copenhagen meeting fills me with the hope that acting as such a large number of allies will ultimately have a chance of succeeding .
Mr President , I would like to support the proposal not to adopt a resolution because I have heard Mr Schulz say something that I think is very important : if we really want this debate to cover the whole of Europe and not just Italy , then there is no point in voting on a resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of Information &apos; in Italy .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament is being proposed to approve the regulation tabled by the Council without further delay , as this new regulation will simplify the administration of procedures and ensure equal treatment of third-country nationals with a view to social security .
This is a rather astonishing figure , and it is the figure I mentioned in my report that I drew up in the previous parliamentary term of this Parliament .
However , perhaps the EU &apos;s Arctic policy is not as strange as the appointment of the cholera High Representative , Lady Ashton , Sarah Palin , from the former student left , as the High Representative .
One such achievement is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union and must remain a criterion for our bilateral trade agreements in the future .
I was also unable to vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 level because I firmly believe that we need to cut the budget , and their position is a poor starting point for the negotiations .
I think that we attach very little importance to the development of completely new types of cars , hydroelectric cars , fuel cells and electric cars .
Then our roads will be divided .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
The European Union , as a partner of Thailand , is ready , within the framework of its capabilities , to support the country during this difficult process .
Indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should make it possible to create jobs and wealth , is of particular benefit to the local population and does not harm the European fishing processing and canning industry , it is essential that an assessment of its impact be carried out as soon as possible and , if necessary , allow its suspension .
Right now , the Commission and the Council are doing this in a very commendable manner to ensure that gas supplies get on the right track as soon as possible , and to deal with a court case is not , of course , a very effective procedure .
It is essential that the Member States investigate these extremely serious violations of the human rights of Roma women without delay , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all the victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) This is indeed a difficult issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisory authorities , but also - and this has not been mentioned - of the importance of cooperation with national parliaments , particularly with committees for European affairs , budgets and budgetary control .
I recommend to you that , now that the External Action Service sets out its rules on access to information and documents , it is a modern organisation which does not deal with foreign policy , as if it were only the preserve of some Venezuelan diplomats .
All countries are currently correcting their economic policy in order to extricate themselves from an unfavourable economic situation , at least as soon as possible , to what economic growth .
Let me also say something about the Japanese people .
In response to this situation , Mr Barroso said that this was an internal matter .
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be watered down , but rather preserved and strengthened .
There is no secret that the resources of our European identity come directly from a Christian tradition .
While it is useful for large companies , it disrupts public transport and is responsible for the declining state of network and safety .
On the other hand , the debate on Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU must not be left aside .
This risk must be managed effectively and tragic events in Japan remind us that it is a matter of urgency .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers from the risk of injuries caused by all the sharp or spies used in the medical field .
While I will present my report this evening , the whole work is far from over - not for me , nor for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and I would also like to point out that my group has had a rather cautious approach to the adoption of SIS II from the very beginning , given the many implications of data protection .
We need to create the appropriate conditions .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints against 3 406 in 2008 , which represents a 9 % fall .
In its October decision , the European Court of Justice also clearly rejected forced retirement at retirement .
The significant potential for using EGNOS and GNSS are also an area of safety , the environment and more smooth road transport , because they can be used for tolling .
In the area of cohesion , which represents almost a third of the budget , the situation remains that it is the only budgetary area in which the estimated error rate exceeds 5 % .
I would , of course , also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report that received majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of the proposed way out of the crisis towards a green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , is to attract big business into new profitable industries , not to protect the environment and meet the needs of ordinary people .
I therefore share the concerns that you have expressed that these important objectives of the Hungarian Presidency may be undermined by national debates or peculiarities rather than focusing on what unites us .
I agree with the condition for reimbursement of costs on the basis of prior authorisation in justified and precise cases where cross-border healthcare includes the residence of patients in hospitals at least one night and requires highly specialised and costly medical equipment or poses a special risk for patients or populations .
The most important way to take the lead would be , and still is , to strive for more stringent emission reduction targets of at least 30 % .
Above all , the abuses are damaging to those who really seek to alleviate environmental damage .
Of course , the visa scandals from the past show how indiscriminate some states are in charge of their extradition .
The poor populations living in the countryside , which are the most deprived of support , are once again left to the mercy .
I know that you will be able to rise to these challenges .
President of the Czech Republic , allow me to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
Viktor Orbán did not present the political groups of the European Parliament as a European politician , who is striving for consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; attacking populist and nationalist tone &apos; which &apos; protects the Hungarian people &apos; from &apos; attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I view this report positively , and I congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help in convincing Iran not to neglect the nuclear bomb .
I completely disagree with the US , which is proposing preventative bombing and NATO intervention .
However , that is only one of the conditions for European stability .
Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is a very important document which allows us to set out a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
In this way , we are committed to creating the conditions in which the fisheries sector is truly sustainable and can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic are tough , but there is also no doubt that new technologies and progress will allow the necessary opening of areas for greater exploitation of natural resources , the fishing industry is a typical example of this .
The unemployment rate among young people reached 20 % at the beginning of the year due to the economic crisis , while the school dropout rate reached 17 % , affecting young people in rural areas in particular .
There are currently a large number of ecolabels on the market , pictures and texts that may disappear consumers from the images of forests in canning dangerous substances to the requirements for one-off carbon table meals and even environmentally friendly cars .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it wanted to hold European countries to account for the grave situation of the countries of the Third World , instead of ascribing responsibility to those countries themselves .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking each of you in time and delaying your lunch , but I do so only once in 10 years , you may not object .
This is a vicious piece of work : the work on which things must change for the better and it simply does not have enough experience .
Just last year , we agreed to repeal these rules and , while consumers have not noticed the difference too much , our producers have noticed it and are still aware of it .
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , because they only aim at austerity and reducing the social rights of citizens .
We must not allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) budget to be reduced , because that would mean that agriculture probably means nothing for Europe .
At the same time , the premature closure of this huge equipment , expressed in economic calculations , entails huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express my sincere satisfaction with the Commission &apos;s compromise proposal in question .
Mr President , President of the Republic of Latvia , Mr Valdis Zatlers , it is a great honour for us all to welcome you to your first visit to the European Parliament today .
Finally , the drama has been resolved .
If there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration may take place , if there is a readmission agreement , which is the objective , and therefore the European Union &apos;s agreements with this third country are strengthened , it is a global approach and the philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration , thereby strengthening the borders of the Member States of the European Union .
We regret that the report does not take into account our proposal in full , but we welcome the fact that it gives a very similar conclusion to the adolescents .
As the support of a more competitive system for agriculture in an open global trading environment is one of the challenges that President Barroso has assigned to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I will use the Commissioner &apos;s presence in this House to ask him how he is looking at cooperation with his colleague responsible for agriculture in concluding the Doha Round .
The report proposes the simplification of financial monitoring and control and the strengthening of technical and scientific evaluation through a peer evaluation based on excellence .
The proposals made here today should be reviewed , analysed and understood in this context .
It is also necessary to point to legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , funding rules and sometimes intellectual property ) , which can discourage many key players in research and small and medium-sized enterprises from participating .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will re-evaluate Directive 2007 / 52 according to the aspects it has just mentioned .
That is why I also voted in favour of the provisions underlining corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , on the new subject that we have developed together , in other words , on the issue of transparency , we are moving more slowly ; in fact , on the basis of new regulations on access to documents , those who run infringement proceedings or require infringement proceedings to start , clearly less and less , to see why these procedures have been concluded or started .
Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that this is not the first time that we have discussed the appalling human rights situation in this Chamber , which , unfortunately , is always half-empty this hour .
The role of society is therefore to act in such a way that women and men can freely choose between the two logical options , each of which has reason to live in a broader vision , such as a vision of work .
At the moment , it supports the consumption of products with a somewhat reduced nutritional value , and it is placing thousands of livestock farmers in a country that is unable to access its market , covering 50 % of its needs , in a difficult situation .
It is not yet possible to clearly predict the full consequences of the current situation on our portfolio and the development of our activities .
In the context of the peace process in the Middle East , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law are as important today as ever - and perhaps even more important than ever .
The use of fossil fuels leads to a centralised , hierarchical and inflexible energy divorce .
In this regard , I agree with the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) The Hungarian Presidency of the EU is half-time , so it is worth assessing the achievements that have been made so far .
I believe that the revision of the first railway package of directives must identify the problems faced by those Member States that have received reasoned opinions from the Commission , as well as how they can be dealt with .
Israel is unaware that such a robust military response encourages new potential suicide assassinations and calls new Kassam rockets at the first opportunity possible .
The authorities in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s imprisonment and the call for her release , which has been addressed to them by many countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , the Secretary-General of the ASEAN countries and many ASEAN Member States , which ultimately include Burma .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
rapporteur Cutaş pointed out to us that the European Union &apos;s budget guarantees for the activities of the Investment Bank at the end of 2009 amounted to almost EUR 20 billion , which is convenient to the European Union &apos;s capabilities , and that is why Parliament , I think , rightly expects an explanation of the risks involved in this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , and on behalf of Tim Soini , and on my own behalf , I would now like to see where there is information about the project needed by citizens of countries around the Baltic before building work is started .
Without the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would never be born out .
I think that an information campaign on this subject is essential .
Since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to ensure the verification of identity documents held by the people of Kosovo .
In this area , too , steps have been taken and clear and precise rules have been introduced .
Do they want a vision of the United States of Europe &apos;s federal vision , as proposed by Mr Corbett , or a freer vision of a free trade Europe , as promoted by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Patrii Toia , on the quality of the report presented today .
This is not criminal : it is criminal to continue what you have been doing for years .
We are rarely able to meet somebody who unites so many exceptional abilities in itself .
I firmly believe that everyone in Slovenia will agree that such stress tests should be carried out immediately at the Krško power plant .
It is not a good sign that some Member States do not want the employment summit to take place on this Thursday .
We can see that the countries have done a great deal to meet the criteria and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
In such conditions , it hesitates to allow the Moldovan Government to finance such uncertain European programmes and agencies as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or SESAR when Moldova is not a member of the European Union .
This would mean that we kill two birds with one stone , because this infrastructure would encourage the European economy , as well as providing jobs and would also alleviate the effects of a similar crisis .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Hty-Mansijia , it was agreed that our common goal was to conclude a strategic agreement that provides a broad framework for EU-Russia relations for the immediate future and to help develop the potential of our relationship .
It is now clear that we are still not doing what is needed in terms of the events in the Mediterranean , and particularly in Libya : we need to think a little more about and recognise that we probably need to take stronger steps to understand what is happening and also so that we can take coordinated action in the Mediterranean .
The precondition for providing European Union substantial financial assistance to this trap was that the project would be supported by local citizens and that investments from Italian private sources will be made available .
( SK ) A week ago , reports were published on the accession process in the Balkan States .
For this reason , we have also abstained from voting on the proposals of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on the TV1 issues in Portugal , even though the Portuguese Communist Party is well known for its critical stance on the situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed reporting arrangements by individual countries so that transnational corporations have to report to each country .
The problem of prostitution and trafficking in women is a key issue in this report .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , regarding the completion of the Tribunal &apos;s role , even in the case of the arrest and trial of Mladić and Hadžić , the work of the Tribunal will not be completed .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support subsidised farmers who have spent their own cattle inadvertently and to apply compensation claims to companies responsible for this crisis .
I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use ICT information and communication technologies in order to improve energy efficiency in the Union and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
If we want to find solutions , we need to use the same approach in the future .
However , you know that our message is structural reforms , and structural reforms are absolutely essential for increasing Europe &apos;s growth potential and for creating jobs .
Particularly during the current global financial crisis , this partnership can be of the utmost importance and open up new opportunities for trade , science and technology exchange , which will enable us to take stronger and more stable positions after exiting the crisis .
We can no longer tolerate inactivity .
in writing . - The approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon means increased responsibility for Parliament and hence the administrative burden .
During a period of unprecedented crisis which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that the number of unemployed or poor workers in Europe does not grow to 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to reiterate the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I tabled together with four other Members of the European Parliament plus one Member of Parliament , to commit the Council and the Commission to legislation that will really effectively combat corruption .
Mr President , the chairpersons of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports your programme for Parliament and for Parliament &apos;s leadership over the next five years .
Anyone , in the name of democracy , would live up to those promises !
We believe that it is through this kind of dialogue that we can help these countries , especially through greater participation by civil society .
Although , as a socialist , I believe that the guerrilla war , under Sri Lanka &apos;s conditions , will not solve anything , has the right to protect itself against military oppression .
It is time to defend simpler , less costly measures for SMEs , the natural consequence of which may be more jobs and more growth .
It is very important to adopt uniform security measures within the European Union in the fight against this phenomenon , including exchanges of packaging .
When we talk about group actions , there will always be a US model , an experience of it and its extremes .
The rapid entry into force of EU-US agreements on rendition and legal assistance would improve cooperation in the area of criminal law and remove the opaque sphere that allowed flights with extremely extradited persons .
I have three proposals and I would like to ask as strongly as possible for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been asked several times in specific cases to decide whether sports activities are purely a beneficial service to be a social service or , on the contrary , also has economic aspects which suggest that it is a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is one of the greatest priorities for this institution , and citizens must know about this .
It is only time to show whether this issue will only be marginal or whether it will undoubtedly prevail the positive effects of the directive .
Modernising freight logistics and promoting co-modality , i.e. interconnecting different modes of transport within the same transport chain , give us the opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region .
It should be left up to the Member States to decide democratically whether or not the current ILO Convention wants to ratify .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , a minimum monthly income was channelled from EUR 123 in Bulgaria and EUR 157 in Romania to EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that is finally adopted will not be so bad .
The Copenhagen Summit was , in many ways , disappointing .
We ask both international government and non-governmental donors not to continue their activities in certain areas if the law is passed .
This is an obstacle to the judicial protection of individual rights and an issue that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe is the home of our homes .
If I speak Hungarian with a police officer in Slovakia , then he has to answer in Slovak , even though the Hungarian language is his mother tongue and regardless of the fact that I do not understand his replies .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to refer once again to one of the aspects of transatlantic cooperation in the area of control and justice on the subject of SWIFT , which we have already discussed , namely the subject of SWIFT transfer to the US .
In 2009 , we saw an alarming increase in the use of various national protection in the various Member States of the European Union and also in the new developing countries .
In the case of SWIFT , neither the Commission nor the Council take transparency seriously .
Finally , on the political stage , it is important for us to have an alliance with the ACP countries within the World Trade Organisation .
We need to do something different .
If we succeed in helping combining the abandoned scrap with the family aspiring to children , this will make a very important contribution .
I would therefore like to make one of the important points in order for the 2020 strategy to be successful , especially to talk about how vital it is that the various institutions of the European Union stop competition between themselves and that we really work together on the instruments without which the objectives contained in the 2020 strategy will not be realised .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events which took place in Gaza should also force us to look at Gaza from a more strategic and long-term point of view .
It is essential to create additional indicators which will help explain which factors affect standard of living in the country .
According to health professionals , the treatment of the correct medicines can be delayed by a year from leaving the person suffering from this disease to the expensive constitution .
Mr Tajani , Commissioner for Industry and Enterprise , he undertook to verify the losses in this sector .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four proposals aimed at implementing a Council decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is primarily a vote on the position of the European Parliament .
In the turbulent global circumstances and in a period of economic and financial crisis , the European Union must strengthen its strategic independence in order to maintain its values , monitor its own interests and protect its citizens by developing a common vision of the major challenges and threats , and by sorting out its capacities and resources so that it can adequately respond to them , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and world security .
This period is beneficial for the relationship between the two parties , and the results of the current global agreement are good .
It will be a new step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , and I hope that it will contribute to greater legitimacy for the citizens of Europe .
I suggest that you look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for an active approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
However , in order to successfully tackle this problem , we must support our actions with robust and resolute policy measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I have told you .
I would like the exemptions to be granted either for a clear period or for clear criteria , but for them to be structured , and perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to put forward in order to move in some way towards meeting India &apos;s requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I have heard tens of thousands of people make the most varied accusations about the Italian Prime Minister with the exception of his business .
Whether or not this is timely is , of course , an issue that should be looked at by Parliament itself .
This report therefore serves to highlight the importance of the unknown programme and calls for changes to the importance of the unknown programme : to change the excessively burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the low success rate for which this programme is still too restrictive for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) at a time when the reversal of the results of research and services is still distributed ; to ensure better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders at a time when funding is still distributed .
The point is that , in the Greek crisis , the ECB is not independent - it has chosen the parties .
This will not result in our businesses becoming uncompetitive .
The honourable Member is calling for a global ban on scanners displaying the body as if music .
According to statistical data , Europe &apos;s cardiovascular diseases cause approximately 4.3 million deaths a year and over 1.7 million people die every year from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and the most effective measure of public health to protect Europeans from infectious diseases , but they are also important for healthcare to reach developing countries and thus contribute to increasing life expectancy and combating poverty .
We must therefore state loudly that abuses of the introduction of new rules in the euro area by banks to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens are an outrageous rush .
In this economic situation and , moreover , here in the European Parliament , we must guarantee unconditional expenditure under control .
I therefore believe that increased protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for Europe &apos;s competitiveness .
He had a very important role , because he has followed all the processes in the Supreme Court of State Security and has regularly evaluated prison conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordinate the various Community instruments .
Each of the new Member States seemed to respect the fundamental principles of the EU and the prohibition of discrimination , as well as to protect and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
Not only financial credit has been reduced , but also social credit .
These new measures would enable European citizens and businesses to enforce their rights better , especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and social and residential entitlements .
The issue of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a one-off issue .
In its conclusions , the Council calls on the Commission to continue its impact assessment in order to prepare , if necessary , an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
I will cite the fact : men have the right to become fully involved in the first day after their child is born .
Such intentions deserve recognition , not criticism , although they are not the main ones at the moment .
The reality is that we in the EU need an end to our absolute dependence on Russian energy supplies .
( RO ) Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 11 largest trading partner , while the trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounted for 1.6 % of the EU &apos;s total foreign trade in 2010 .
I would first like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced it into the Rules of Procedure was Mrs Marylène Renault , not I .
The country &apos;s own fisheries sector is still completely undeveloped .
In today &apos;s debate , we are debating four reports , so I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the European Commission for their cooperation .
On the summit , I agree that this is an important opportunity .
This regulation will clarify the relevant rules on cabotage throughout the EU in a uniform and unbureaucratic manner , without affecting existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the EC Treaty , I refer here in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comments .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that China &apos;s representatives would at any time be able to study documents in the archives of his government in exile to make sure that he did not inspire violence .
Their response to this challenge hinders them from developing and integrating into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
With the evidence of many demagogic and professionally unfounded claims , we are daily on media sites , but also here in the European Parliament .
Since human rights are a key aspect of the agreement in force between the EU and Pakistan , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of adopting the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive because it is expected that this will have a decisive impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it directly affects the buildings in which they live and which they live .
Amendment 9 has presented an unacceptable attitude to derogation - albeit temporary - from the principles underpinning the European Union , including the four fundamental freedoms .
But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this Parliament to consider this as a reason to demand a bigger budget .
The time has finally come to stop the one-sided preference of the United States .
Mr Dalli and the Commission , now that we have this directive , I would like you to focus more closely on the social security regulation , and it represents a system on which everything is based and which clarifies who is valid and within which everything is well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common objective of working together with the Arctic States and the international community in order to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
I think we needed it very much , and it is a good example of what this Parliament has achieved in budget making : let us say it in this way : we will use funds that have not been used in other areas .
Let us now look at the hypotheses .
For this to happen , we need to make every effort to reduce the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In such sensitive sectors as the clothing industry , leaked products and furniture , it is essential that consumers be able to make an informed choice , an important factor for those businesses that have chosen to maintain production in Europe , thereby preserving European knowledge and European jobs .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for decades , the international community has not managed to stop this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument that promotes the strengthening of relations with third countries and brings some tangible benefits .
Moreover , it is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only a right but also a duty to express its opinion .
However , with this draft document , we have broken this barrier and done so on the basis of the need for patient care .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency .
I believe that every patient is entitled to good quality care provided in his own language , in the vicinity of his place of residence , and in the immediate vicinity of his family .
In the speeches in this House , we must use the deadlines and the terms that everyone has adopted , and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , a candidate country , was adopted under this name and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be achieved and would lead to better results .
The latest developments in the European economy , not least in relation to Greece , have shown that there is an urgent and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
Their sponsor Stuart Wheeler also lacked behind , who said that Europe costs the United Kingdom GBP 120 billion a year , which is 36-time more than a real sum .
A two-pronged approach to Belarus - carrot and stick , as Mr Tannock said - will hopefully be successful .
We could talk about other issues - energy , non-proliferation - which you wish for , but I think an important point is the fundamental agreement on what we have done in the last time , as expressed in three reports today .
Secondly , he also said that the Commission should start considering the possibility of Eurobonds - let me say , finally .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information ( debate )
That is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
Under the regulation , tyre suppliers must provide information to users on fuel consumption , driving resistance , wet grip and external discharges .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also believe that , in this effort to achieve more substantial and ambitious results , the European Union should retain a certain degree of flexibility during the final phase of the COP 16 negotiations in order to respond to the developments that the negotiations will bring .
For this reason , balanced and transparent measures are needed , because obtaining the confidence of our entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for the success of the project .
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of widespread urbanisation on the environment , especially on coastal areas and Spanish islands , but also on other areas , such as Madrid .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia monitor the situation very closely , cooperate closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
These processes should include unavoidable maintenance and surveillance following shutdown , processing , storage and decontamination of waste , the ecological modernisation of facilities and support for the replacement of the energy capacities of the decommissioning plants , paying particular attention to the sustainability of the environment and energy efficiency .
That is my opinion .
I come from a country where , every time I go into supermarket , I meet some person on a bridge with a woooded drive .
For example , there has been a major debate on the sale of fertile land in developing countries and on countries that do not have arable land , and this is , in itself , an interesting topic for discussion , and I think we could agree with one another here .
Without a European network , however , we will not achieve the key objectives of the European Union .
In Europe , tobacco is growing in 17 of the 27 Member States , each government grants subsidies .
One of the three languages - English , French or German - will automatically be used to guarantee legal protection throughout the EU .
In Ireland , this subject is highly controversial and is playing into the hands of those who are campaigning for a &apos; no &apos; vote .
The Presidency has done its utmost to reach an agreement , but ultimately it has decided that the European Council must decide on this matter .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that we occasionally have differing views .
So this Commission will work in this way .
However , this problem could have only been the same with regard to the resettlement of the agency in a building in which it will have its long-term office .
The proposed amendments will also enable the use of this fund by less developed Member States , which also include Romania .
The next item is the vote .
I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all sides of the House as praised by the Belgian Presidency .
In the current situation , I do not even need to stress the importance of both these points .
We will work together to conclude the Doha Round in 2010 and its positive outcome , because it is extremely important to strive to promote recovery and combat protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a little exceptional for me to have this day , because after 10 years of good and faithful service , it was my last meeting that I chaired here in Brussels .
From the point of view of efficiency , I also consider the proposal that these delegations assume certain consular functions , such as the handling of Schengen visas , to be interesting .
It seemed that we spent a lot of time discussing one another rather than the day-to-day negotiations with other parties , and we suffered a great deal of slaughter .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos;s proposal must be better prepared , so Parliament should have more time to decide .
Perhaps there are plans to go behind the present proposal .
All Member States would be in a much harder situation without the European Union and its protective shield .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in the area of general basic education , reducing poverty and increasing access to safe drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso stated with the Treaty of Lisbon that it is the Commission that is speaking on behalf of the European Union on environmental matters .
There may be views , even opposition , even the views of the Eurosceptics may be permitted , but the final result must be the same .
Lukashenko has managed to use the agenda of his campaign as a madness political actor , benefiting from all political and economic advantages , while continuing to show disrespect for democracy and human rights .
According to this joint declaration , the European Union and Russia had hoped , on the other hand , that they would negotiate and conclude agreements on small border traffic between Russia and neighbouring Member States of the European Union , which would have an interest in this , and in Regulation ( EC ) No 261 / 2006 .
This is essential for the future wellbeing of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself talked about the gaps that need to be filled in the implementation of our legislation in many Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of Southern Israel have a right to life without bombing .
We must do everything in our power to ensure that we have adequate recycling , not only to prevent environmental and health damage , but also to reduce raw materials .
I must simply remind you that there is still an international arrest warrant on Omaru al-Bashir , which is something that the authorities in that country ignore .
Finally , five December 2008 , the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , wrote to the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs , Mr Gargani , in detail about how the project has progressed , and this letter also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the operation of the project for the first year , starting preparatory work on this matter .
Mr President , I would expect you to respond , Mr President .
As regards the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is sensible , as it deals with the prohibition and gradual replacement of products that have serious harmful effects on human health .
The proposal for a Council decision aims to establish fishing opportunities for European Union vessels on the basis of an available surplus fish stocks , as well as to establish a financial contribution specifically for access rights and sectoral support .
We in the EU must give all our assistance to the new Tunisian Government of unity , as well as to EU citizens , including the British people , who are trapped in Tunisia where they were on holiday .
I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation , fellow Members , as I believe that it is right and proper for Taiwan to be transferred to a positive list of countries .
Unfortunately , these and democratic societies often fail due to commercial interests , or because their management belongs to a certain political environment and indirectly forces their employees to fill censorship .
We cannot live in agreement in the European Union as long as such situations continue to exist , and therefore we think it is very important that we all , the Commission , the authorities of the European Union , put forward proposals and put an end to this situation .
That is one thing , and I will also follow several social , environmental and economic criteria , because I want all legislation to be evaluated beforehand .
That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and dozen European Development Fund .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , I am very pleased that we are talking here in the European Parliament about Belarus , but words are not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support this proposal and speak in favour of it .
Furthermore , I am pleased that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian state , or that Jerusalem is being considered in two countries .
The third thing we can learn from is that the European Union must be prepared for weapons .
There are large disparities , however , even in the regions of the same Member State .

Personally , I believe that Europe needs a unified energy policy in order to prevent a huge dependence on resources from one area .
The FVO has also found huge shortcomings in the traceability system which Brazil has used and has revealed problems for many shipments to the European Union which have not had the necessary certificates .
These committees will now gradually take the floor .
For this reason , I believe that the most important question now is : how and what could we continue to build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency ?
As a result of this crisis , the role of the European Union must be strengthened .
At the heart of this proposal is the insistence on reciprocal dialogue and that the opinions expressed are taken into account and respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore Polish streets and towns in regions where the majority of the population belongs to the Polish minority .
As all these measures are interlinked , necessary and in line with the scope of the ambitions enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result as quickly as possible , commensurate with citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report because it represents significant progress compared with the current situation .
That is why I voted in favour of the resolution .

Mr President , I agree with Mr Daul &apos;s remarks .
A decision has been taken today emphasising that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest possible participation of the various categories of operator , while respecting their different and specific identities .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who is involved in monitoring the rabies that we have seen in recent weeks from the Mediterranean region , where many people are fleeing from the unfavourable situation in Africa to Europe , some of whom have failed to do so .
This is not happening , however , and the situation in Lampedusa is a sad example of this .
Israel is bombing and deciding .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The question of the CAP and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for the constructive discussion which looks to the future .
This partnership must be based on mutual respect , fulfilment of the common commitments and respect for the values upheld by the European Union in terms of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
Indeed , 3 % of the European Union &apos;s GDP is accountable and is a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this context , as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , we have tabled an amendment calling - not just for Europe , of course , we are also very much addressing the United States , as the Commissioner is well aware of - for all forms of export subsidies to be completely abolished , and straight away .
Most contributors highlight the need to direct or focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture , on climate change , on food security , quality requirements and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
Of course , it is particularly important that certain European Union subsidies for cities are increased , as there is a major potential for the economy and finance , because cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will be officially submitted next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
We need significant financial resources if we are to achieve a 25 % reduction in greenhouse gases , as scientific scientists are recommending , and if we are to halt the decline in biodiversity .
Only carrot and stick , which form the basic dynamic of the accession process , can force the governments of these countries to concentrate on the implementation of activities and reforms that can consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans once and for all .
I will focus on two reports , given their importance .
For the sake of legal certainty for all parties involved , we must achieve the application of the same rights throughout Europe in the case of people accused of crime and the provision of compulsory information on these rights .
Foreign matters and diplomacy fall within the scope of national sovereignty , and that is why we voted against all the reports on this matter .
I am referring to the article to satisfy Mr Weber .
I also appreciate the positive assessment in the proposal regarding the continued efforts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that the events just a few hours ago in Greece will not extend , and I believe that they can , on the contrary , mark the start of a unanimous effort to create a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We are in contact with the people of Tunisia and Egypt every hour , with our delegations , whom I pay tribute for what they have had to pay attention over the last few weeks , and we are also in direct contact with government and with services .
I believe , in fact , that this financial instrument is even more important in the light of the financial crisis , because it can help businesses to recover more efficiently and , in future , can represent a pilot project to create a more generous energy fund .
These inspections were insufficient .
Only then will we be able to provide a wide-ranging contribution from Europe , but this mess cannot be duty-free .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman following up on the proposal for a recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT by Parliament concerning the inadequate postponement of the Commission &apos;s response to the Ombudsman .
The most important progress achieved through this directive in comparison with the current legislation is that patients will be able to choose a healthcare provider and will have access to information about the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I would like to reiterate the need for the European Commission to call for the flexible mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund , as well as for a review of the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund in order to adapt them to the requirements arising from this tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer rights organisations and representatives from the world of business , it is clear to me that we must insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I said that anyone who asked questions is bad in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the obligation to monitor the negotiations - in this case , the trade negotiations - and to intervene politically with the help of the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as the hearings , resolutions and the oral question , in order to be informed of the progress of these negotiations .
We do not recognise citizens &apos; investments in social cohesion at all or solidarity between generations .
However , a real reform is on admissibility .
At present , this is one of the most serious issues of human rights in the European Union .
To this end , sufficient funding must be allocated to enable the creation of opportunities and the use of new sources of global competitiveness in the EU .
In many European countries , it is the case that , when public authorities are in difficulties , they generally pay late and very often cause some companies to go bankrupt .
The G20 has set itself the disposal of tax havens as one of the fundamental objectives .
However , the political class does not respond to this .
The Dolor , of course , remains the theft of global transactions , and still represents secure investment , but the colossal debt accumulated by the United States , when the rest of the world financed their lifestyle , is increasingly heated in terms of the ability of this economic power to fulfil its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures to combat and win over those who seek to destroy it .
A significant factor is that , when Iceland was a wealthy country , it was not interested in joining the European Union .
And this , Mr Vice-President , is not a new request .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving everyone involved in order to ensure a high level of local acceptance .
However , it is a problem that will extend the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions for as long as they continue to fight in Afghanistan .
We must combat fragmentation , and therefore I urge Commissioner Andor not to leave the European Social Fund intact and disconnect it , as has been proposed several times in this House .
The fact that we will not achieve everything we want under the compromise is becoming a reality .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for their constructive approach during the budget procedure , which has resulted in good cooperation .
The Group of Social Democrats cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to stress that the negotiations did not have an open end , which would have the way for more realistic alternatives , such as a priority partnership .
So , above all , it is an American problem that must be resolved by Washington .
Let me also say that we should implement a reform which would make European universities more independent and European-wide , open for students and researchers and would create dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The quotas that are bought can be left in the national reserve and then distributed to the needs of the Member States later .
I therefore ask once again that 25 May , the day for execution , be declared international heroes of the fight against totalitarianism , because many unknown people , like the Pilecki , have lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedom deserve to be commemorated .
I will briefly mention the work done .
If this were to become the majority of the European Union during the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the intensive , funded peace plan that originated following the wars in the Balkans .
I hope that these changes will stimulate people &apos;s participation in EMAS , because I believe that this system is good and could help us meet the sustainability criteria , not because I would like to play a part in the numbers and see EMAS competing with ISO .
( DE ) ( The speaker responds to Cristian Dan Preda &apos;s question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have already said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I believe that it will go well .
The monetary dumping and social consequences that it entails must no longer be permitted .
This aspect is very important for ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
If we identify best practice stemming from the experiences of the Member States and if we respect fundamental standards such as the prohibition of discrimination , fair and equal treatment and protection from direct and indirect expropriation , we will have the foundations for a coherent European policy in this area .
I am aware that during public consultations on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , participants from the sheep meat sector advocated compulsory origin marking .
Mr Kelly , I am well aware of the complexity of this issue .
Although most countries are facing a number of economic and financial problems , particular attention must be focused on halting the adverse effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must agree that this report will initiate a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system .
So the overall suitability of these measures has increased .
President of the Commission . - As the European Parliament does , the Commission has the right to express its views on the audit process .
For example , the level of fraud in France and Spain is regarded as &apos; suspicious low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solutions and in whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore essential that the Member States establish a common network of statistical data and a platform for coordinating research into the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view , many times expressed in this House , that the more European solidarity we have , the better the relations between Europe and Russia .
As far as freedom of expression and association are concerned , Syria still has a long way to go .
Much remains to be done before we can guarantee women fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal needs to be reviewed in such a way as to take into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the dairy situation is unsustainable .
I supported this report because I wanted , above all , to highlight one threat that the report mentions : the lack of reliable and extensive information for consumers on the health characteristics , composition and origin of specific species of fish .
After all , history is full of examples of interference by the West , which have done more damage than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that the proposal tabled here is completely ineffective and is unable to deal with crime prevention for several reasons .
The Palestinian agreement is a key political event and , contrary to what has just been said here , Hamas , for the first time , agreed that the Organisation for the Liberation of Palestine and the Palestinian Authority should act as its negotiating partners .
Countries are argued and negotiated how to divide the sea drama .
Energy is particularly important , especially when we are aware of the energy infrastructure problems that ...
In other words , it is the institution that is founded in order to protect us from criminals , indirectly by providing professional training to the police , that is now coming to an end on the desk of defendants .
However , the reluctance of power Fidel Castro Raúl has not brought about democratic reforms , nor the release of political prisoners .
The review of energy efficiency will be included in all advertisements which will include information about energy consumption or which will be related to prices .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are all familiar with the Washington consensus : you were delighted about it .
In this way , we could also respond adequately to the real events on the ground , but that is what Frontex is doing .
Finally , I would like once again to thank not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked on this issue with the Czech Presidency and I very much appreciate its support for our efforts to find an acceptable way forward .
Mr Wessberg , in particular , is a particularly appropriate candidate for ensuring a balance between EU law and the specific requirements of both the European market and Europeans , because of his commitment to the private sector &apos;s commercial structure .
Up to now , this conflict has cost 1 000 lives in 17 days .
Only if measures of this kind are taken will the number of falsified medicines be reduced and their use safer .
We must learn from the Opel affair : it is not yet too late for us to have a coordinated European strategy for the car industry .
We did so because , like you , President Obama and I reject the black white vision of a decision between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro proposes to make wage growth a permanent policy less limited .
At Church airport , a new trial began , and the legal recommendations say that the use of these machines by minors may contradict child safety and legislation to protect it for the nature of the images created .

in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting in favour of the report on the creation of a new microfinance instrument which will help to set up or develop micro-people at risk of jobs .
It is important that we have made some progress in this regard through Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I fully agree with , and I think that this report will enable us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes as Community programmes , which will give a new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , I understand that the improvements that I made on behalf of Parliament on behalf of the improvements are essential for a fair and effective energy market .
In the current economic crisis , it is of paramount importance to support and encourage self-employed workers .
It is simply not necessary to ask Brussels for them at all .
Mr President , it is clear to us , both in Europe and in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , an element of the change that can cause conflict or unite between us , and it is precisely this problem that employs us today .
I voted in favour of this report because the food programme we are considering for extending is a key instrument for helping deprived persons who are particularly affected by the current economic crisis , even in terms of their basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , operate at least one state-sponsored export credit agency , and these agencies together represent the most important source of public financial support for projects in the private sector .
That is why we are not voting for this report .
By taking this position , we have contributed to the destruction of this common government .
By creating the Council &apos;s Muslim faith Council in 2003 , Mr Sarkozy , at that time , Minister for the Interior , Islam , implemented into French institutions .
On this matter , I have already asked the European Commission for a position and for consideration to be given to the possibility of creating special programmes to create equal opportunities for women operating in science .
This is the struggle we will continue in order to ensure that citizens &apos; rights and endless users have access to services .

Opening of the sitting
I hope that , since this summer , the Commission has taken the lead in coordinating a strategy for development in key areas such as support for civil education , vocational education and employment .
The cost will apply to the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to establish dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for stability in this area .
We can therefore expect that reactors &apos; accidents occur every 25 years .
In my opinion , this extension of eligibility to housing expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF must lead us to consider further possible developments , both in the medium and long term , whether in terms of funding eligibility or in terms of the allocation of funds to certain strategic priorities .
Today , the time has come for us to speak again about violations of religious rights in both of these countries , but this time in Christians .
Climate change : one of the greatest dangers our planet faces .
As I expected , there was , of course , a great deal of emphasis on human rights , on the importance of ensuring that they are clearly part of all our dynamic relations and that they accompany our work .
I must also say that , to date , the European Union has had absolutely no competence to regulate air traffic .
However , Europe is not a bail-out in the economic crisis and a medicine for it .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and optional regulations .
I do not believe that some of the warm words that have been said here today , or the words spoken by the Commission , can turn something into the European Union &apos;s absence in Libya and that it is not at present able to stop the crisis in cities or Operation of Gaddafi &apos;s ground troops .
I therefore firmly believe that , if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , it will benefit the citizens of the EU , because they will be able to make far more choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , we share the hope that the European Council will agree on the measures that alarm markets and reintroduce stability into the euro area because , either we are members or not , we are all interested in this .
It has become clear that the funds for pre-accession aid are particularly vulnerable .
That is the reason for genuine gratitude and happiness .
We therefore call for an end to war and violence by all parties , and we urge the EU to act accordingly .
The world around Europe is heading towards energy problems directly .
The measurement of the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in the ridicule for sales or renting , which will be published in the media .
It is essential to support efforts aimed at increasing the EU &apos;s investments with a view to diversifying cross-border structures , encouraging alternative , unconventional forms of energy at local level and improving infrastructure capacity to facilitate links with new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which in turn leads to an increase in internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the creation of an ESP rapid response instrument , which would respond immediately and flexibly to the political changes in partner countries , as happened recently in the neighbouring countries of the South .
I find it simply ridiculous that anyone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission .
The problem , therefore , is that only those Members who can understand you in their native language are listening to you .
We have spent a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted issues that affect our fellow citizens , our electorate , namely , the issues of the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because in order to do a good job , we must comply with those who have chosen us .
As some MEPs claim , the EU budget cannot be used as a supplement to national budgets at a time of austerity , but should reflect the difficult situation in which EU Member States find themselves .
President-in-Office of the Council . - The Treaty has given no authority to the Council to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States .
It is no longer the case before .
Call me a cynical , but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always come to short-term visits .
Is the cause of this situation the global financial crisis , which has turned into an economic crisis , or are we dealing here with our own errors , negligence and inadequate actions ?
My second point relates to the role of the Belgian Presidency in the period following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The primary objective of these regimes was , and is , to maintain the consistency of the territory of this huge state , which is inhabiting a number of completely different nations .
( PL ) Mr President , despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
This is the case in many areas with Japan , but I recognise , for example , Japan &apos;s right to protect its fish market in order to protect its fish farmers and to pay higher prices than those of the world markets , and not allow massive imports that would cause disappearance of its small farmers - just as I recognise the rights of our economies to protect certain sectors of their activities .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to speak about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
That is why I decided to work on this new strategy for strengthening social priorities , as I said earlier when we discussed the general policy guidelines for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , will I move straight on to the question of what measures - and I am using a number of figures here - does the Commission intend to take in the short term to address these shortcomings ?
This is precisely what has so far been lacking , or this has not been sufficiently visible for citizens .
It is of little interest to the citizens , and quite rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 00.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send a clear signal and approve with an overwhelming majority Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report , whom I and the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta , thank .
At the same time , Romania has supported the open door policy , aimed mainly at strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
Furthermore , I firmly believe that everything must be done to eliminate the effects of this scourge and restore living conditions .
I am thinking , of course , not only of the accidents of work that occur quite often , but also of the dangerous substances used in production processes .
In September 2009 , the Council started a detailed examination of the proposal to amend the decision on the creation of a European Refugee Fund .
At the moment , it is important to pay special attention to the island and the outermost regions , which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , now have to face destroyed infrastructure and destroyed personal , commercial and agricultural property , in which normal activity cannot be restored immediately in many cases , especially in the regions that are almost entirely dependent on tourism , because the display of these events in the media can be displayed .
We have not been able to cope with such huge financial losses since 9 / 11 and , despite the financial problems that all Member States are currently struggling with , I would call on them to support plans to support a sector that simply cannot cope with further losses .
At the same time , we must admit that we are playing a greater risk .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in the Congo is terrible .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small language or perhaps sécmantic comment .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you can very much want something to happen - but you have to see the reality .
Consumers &apos; organisations support binding collective redress measures in all Member States , combined with other options , such as extending existing mechanisms for extra-judicial settlements ( MVS ) collective redress .
The problem is not Turkey &apos;s Cypriots , as some people are saying .
I would like to ask the Commission what action it is taking to ensure that horses are slaughtered in the country of origin and do not have to take a long and resultant journey to consumption countries .
That is what we need to do .
It really is not my head where human rights defenders who are as happy as we do , that the West is secular and pluralistic , but who shamefully diverge from the Middle East , which is a little bit reserved for a single religion , have been lost .
Work is already under way on this and , furthermore , we have a dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who waste our money are sick , but Mr Schulz , the politicians , who are now increasing deficits and debts at the expense of the younger generations , are equally irresponsible .
For this , I owe it to the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various groups .
We believe that the Member States must act now .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for democracy and human rights was good , in fact , they were both very willing to cooperate .
We should strive to ensure that the programmes we offer support as much as possible the reforms under way in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that all Member States maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information , i.e. the availability of healthcare , procedures and the necessary documentation .
We previously saw all events in the Soviet Union as an ideological coercion , but we are now discussing trade in conditions of individual absolute freedom .
Whether we consider this to be a private or public fund , this report deals with a very specific matter , namely , for Parliament to state that , firstly , it has no legal entitlement to subsidise its deficit and , secondly , that there will be no such doctrine of deficit .
Their faces are , however , the most expensive since Helenya Trójan , which has caused the deployment of thousands of boats .
The aid which leads to distortions of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have negative consequences for both employment and technological developments .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think that we should think a few things in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard the various Members that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with reverse majority voting mechanism .
( FR ) Nevertheless , I really do think it is very important to recall what the real problems are at stake here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I would like to call on you all to show solidarity with her today in order to show solidarity with her for stopping this barbaric ritual , the Russian lupioneer , as a symbol of our resistance to this practice .
Democratic control is being pushed into the background as national governments hide behind the Commission and behind a troika in terms of the most basic measures , and the Commission refers to national governments in these matters .
The new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
Following the threats that the Commission will lodge a judicial hearing in the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now begun to allow the use of the BDE .
For us who come from rural constituency , as well as those who are members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , it is clear that the current situation in which many livestock farmers find themselves is simply unsustainable .
Consumers deserve transparent information , which is clear and accessible .
I believe that our role could be to support the Chinese people in their efforts to create a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms during the vote because I believe that we need to be demanding and ambitious if we are to achieve an improvement in budgetary stability in Europe , thereby ensuring our future .
It is also important that the organisation of an initiative , a social organisation , clearly and unambiguously set its subject and objective , although it does not necessarily need to put forward a proposal for legislation .
In Latvia , there is a city of Doha gavpils , with more than 90 % of the population being Russian-speaking .
I would like to welcome here Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apologies , as well as the recent proposal by the Czech Republic Government to take a series of measures to ensure that such violations never again occur by 31 December 2009 .
I welcomed this report because GDP is an indicator of economic and market activity which has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
The effects of globalisation are now completely being overshadowed by the financial and economic crisis , and our considered response is the modification of the EGF &apos;s funding criteria .
The resolution submitted notes the statement of the independence of Kosovo of 17 February 2008 , which has been recognised by 69 countries , and encourages the Member States to work together on their common approach to Kosovo in view of its planned accession to the EU .
Compared to any institution , Parliament can still be seen as being more open to the way to transparency , and therefore I would not regard this issue as a top priority because , with regard to access to documents , transparency in parliamentary negotiations and the activities of Members of the European Parliament , we are more open than any national parliament .
This was about the internal politicisation of the Italian Minister for Reform Umbert Bosnia .
Human Rights Observatory warnings in Astat - my region - and many other organisations must be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution concerning the ban on pork and beef .
For this reason , I have decided to abstain from the vote and I will follow closely the ongoing investigations .
After all , the European Commission &apos;s figures are also not entirely adequate to lay down the measures to be used to punish the Member States with the highest level of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings represents the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions in sectors not covered by the emissions trading system by 20 % .
Turning to the second question , I can assure honourable Members that the Commission knows that control of the AMR requires a multidisciplinary approach .
Yesterday , the trialogue gives hope for a definitive agreement .
The future forecasts based on an annual growth rate of around 27 % in the coming years indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis for the proposal should be modified in such a way that it has the form of a regulation and not a Council decision .
Many people ask me what ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because the EU &apos;s financial assistance will help people who have been victims of globalisation to find work , return to the labour market and get out of the recession .
Given that the Internet is a major tool for creating better conditions and developing and knowledge for citizens in a cultural sense , especially for audiovisual content broadcasting , I welcome the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in the issue of radio spectrum and in creating a software for development and innovation .
All this exacerbates the usual anxiety about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , as well as the problems that would occur in the event of a country that shares a border with more than 80 million inhabitants , and these are factors that will continue to consolidate my unmistakable belief that it is not right for Turkey to join a Europe whose unity , above all , depends on the idea of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This means going against the environment and consumer safety , because the old and possibly dangerous high-energy equipment would be put back on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I would like to put on record the thanks of primacy Balingen Dr Reitemann and local council for enabling the detection of a wall in memory of the lives of these young men .
Thirdly , I have a big request for Mrs Kroes : if we want to be proud of this key project in the future , we need to speed up digitisation in the Member States .
Who has experienced and seen the consequences of the environmental disaster caused by the failure of technology in Baia Mare and the consequent release of toxic cyanide flows into waterways with far-reaching effects on the fauna Tis in Hungary , but also the Danube in Bulgaria &apos;s territory , must do everything to ensure that something like this can never happen again in the European Union .
Everyone is responsible for this : the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , developing countries will cost climate change more than EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and to their property : basic freedom of movement , as you said , the freedom to cross dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which proposes to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we have found the courage of the summit to call it , that we have invited the social partners to prepare it with them for a long time - there will be three blocks in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague before this Employment Summit - and that we will try to reach conclusions that will be valuable for the June Council .
In fact , the European Parliament has already laid a good basis at first reading for the proper regulation on the cross-border provision of healthcare in the Member States , so that patients can access the necessary ambulatory or hospital healthcare in another Member State , in compliance with the established rules and without burdening the courts .
That is also what Mr Barnier &apos;s report proposed , but we have not yet reached a conclusion .
We must not waste any time .

The Copenhagen Declaration is essential for further improvement of the European Union &apos;s positions on these key factors , which will enable us to maintain a leading position and ensure the success of the Copenhagen negotiations .

in writing . - ( SV ) We have also chosen now to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - now with a view to helping a total of approximately 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering from the effects of the economic crisis and exceptional times require exceptional measures .

Mr President , Mr Kallas , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking you , Mr Kallas , and your colleagues in the Commission for the attention you have paid to Parliament &apos;s work on the discharge procedure for the implementation of the 2007 budget of the European Commission and executive agencies .
To this end , however , we need cohesion policy to focus more on those projects and areas of projects that make Europe as a whole moving forward , enabling them to remain strong and giving the weaker opportunity to catch up with strength .
If we ensure that they are integrated into the global economy , then they will become a new market and thus part of the solution .
I hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina &apos;s political culture will improve and learn in this regard , and that the media in that country will also take responsibility for not getting any more room for nationalistic language in that country than it currently has .
Secondly , I must say a little symbolic that the fact that my last speech in this House should concern REACH and its implementation , which I have spent my time since the start of this parliamentary term , when it seemed that we will never get the end of this legislative margin shows that I have great happiness , and indeed because I have met people like you , my fellow Members , and you have understood the great job .

For example , GDP in the Border , Midlands and Western region ( BMW ) is likely to be reduced by 50-100 % in comparison with European GDP .
The very fact that they are engaging in a joint process to deal with global imbalances and that they agree with financial regulation , for example , should be seen as tremendous progress that would simply not be possible a few years ago , and the Seoul Summit was another important step in this process and the launch of a new programme , not just a one-off event .
The resolution for which I and my group voted contains some of these things , but I think that President Barroso , the Council and Parliament should be bolder .
I also welcome the adoption by the Commission of a number of comments made in this House when we rejected the interim agreement as inadequate .
We are now talking about 51 regions .
In order to achieve results , significant investment is needed in vocational education and training .

( RO ) As the report makes clear , efforts to reduce violence against women must be backed up on two fronts : at Member State level and through measures and programmes managed directly by the European Commission .

Mr President , I have tabled an amendment on the need to implement this regulatory framework in the outermost regions as well .
Parliamentary immunity : see Minutes

I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission .
The next item is the vote .
However , I would like to comment on the issue of the Reception Conditions Directive and the Dublin Regulation , and it seems that I will be the only one who has done so far in this discussion .

Twelve years ago , in Hungary , we thought that we would never go into contact with the IMF , and now , when we ask for credit , he was ready to help us .
In addition , the Commission will present a new communication in the summer or early autumn on the financing of low-carbon technologies .

The constant persecution of a small Christian minority is taking place , which is , unfortunately , an increasingly frequent phenomenon in most Islamic countries .
In the meantime , as I said , we need to solve the legacy of the past , both with regard to certain countries that you know about and which are on the agenda - such as Greece and Ireland - and with other countries where we are taking action to ensure that they do not get on the agenda .
We must give all European citizens the same access to information about medicines .
