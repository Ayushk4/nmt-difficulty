Mr President, Commissioner, we are finalising the work that we started 10 years ago; I still remember clearly the indignation caused by the Erika accident in December 1999: the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio put forward proposals at the time, the cooperation of the Council, which, under pressure from public opinion, was responsible for ensuring that the first packages of refuge were first to be launched and, and, among other things, for monitoring, for the port and, for the European vessel and, among others, for the European policy.

Written statements (Rule 149)
Many EU Member States have no complicity with regard to Guant√°namo because they have allowed flights to be transferred to the illegal transport of prisoners, for example.

As has already been said here, sensible land use, economic and social development in line with nature and strengthened cohesion in the European Union are also essential factors for disaster prevention.

Information and communication technologies (ICT) are, not least, a very important sector, because within the European economy there is a great burden: they constitute 7% of the workforce - the European workforce - and 6% of GDP, that is to say, a significant proportion of the European economy and the European productive and labour force.
I think that we can expect a large number of initiatives that will require the Commission to do more to make European integration closer, and there is no doubt that the Commission will respond enthusiastically to such a request.
Because, if we do not take responsibility and take a clear stand, we can forget what Mrs Toia has already said today: we need to realise that, in 2020 - and we set this out in the Digital Agenda - every European should be able to assert its interests by means of something that is finally possibilities for spectrum.

We will see how this is implemented in the future.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament's efforts more seriously in this regard, although I am very disappointed by the fact that the representative of the Council is no longer present.
If we, as Europeans, are to play an active role in this regard, it is essential that we continue to do so.

However, I call for the introduction of measures to promote a healthy lifestyle, which is a decisive factor in improving health, such as forms of primary prevention.
The need for clear and binding regulations at EU level in view of the problem is becoming even more obvious, given the various Member States' legislation and often restricted in the application of the provisions of international law to combat violence.

Amendment 43 should not result in the failure to accept Amendment 43.
Order of business

However, like other fellow Members, I regret that the Council is questioning Parliament's new codecision power over long-term management plans.
I voted in favour of this report.
- Report: Paolo Costa
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that, after four years, we do not see a Commission proposal tightening up animal transport legislation.
This report is the result of a compromise, because 1 625 amendments have been tabled to it and are divided into a few key points, which include the causes of the crisis, from reality bubble to unsecured banking products, the lack of harmonisation of taxes in Europe and the failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Despite difficult situations, these measures will enable the proper flow of money to be maintained and payments for beneficiaries during the implementation of the programmes to be made.
I believe that the tax authorities of the Member States must cooperate in order to detect tax fraud.
Shabhatic Bhatti, the Minister for the Pakistani Government, Salman Tas√≠r, the Governor of Punjab, or Nau S√°bir Jamaldin, the coordinator of the Human Rights Committee in Pakistan, have become innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law.
I would like to say this in such a way as to describe the positive aspects of the European Union, because, however surprising it may seem, there have been also recently positive phenomena.
This is an important measure which supports families with children, allowing them to reduce the unfair tax burden imposed on them.
We must welcome them with enthusiasm, not petty.
These days, European livestock farmers are experiencing the difficulties that we all have to overcome together to enable the livestock sector to develop and create sufficient incomes for farmers.
This is a two-pronged statement where the EU's control violates the principle.
There are now changes to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which originally had to survive the generation, using the simplified procedure, as requested by the powers in the EU, to create a mechanism that they believe would be'fully in line with the policies (International Monetary Fund)'.
For women, self-employment is of great importance, as it can help them avoid unemployment, or better reconcile professional and family life.
in writing. - It is extremely important that the EU takes action ahead of the forthcoming Copenhagen Summit and become a world leader in reducing carbon emissions.
It is also important to enable women to take part in the post-war reconstruction of their countries.
This will enable candidates from all the Member States of the IMF to compete on merit, taking into account all the important aspects.
Without this assistance, Ukraine would no longer be able to become fully integrated into many areas of the economy and to meet its other objectives.
As a result of the European Parliament's efforts, in fact, all funds sold in the European Union will be subject to the same rules.
Over half a year, the hopes of the European Union's situation has turned into almost total disunity.
This should ensure that companies whose products have been certified in one country do not have to go through the whole certification process in the other country.
In our opinion, it is very important that we work together with India in order to bring about a successful conclusion to the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement which will enable both sides - the European Union and India - to emerge from this struggle in a victory.
Antibiotic resistance (debate)
Mr Takkula's report deals with an important social problem.
in writing. - Many recent events have shown us how important consumer confidence is, and this is partly based on appropriate consumer protection legislation on the market.
I wonder whether Baroness Ashton can confirm this and analyse the situation.
The Muslim Brotherhood, which has 20% of the electorate's support, is openly pursuing this programme.
Of course, we have the Europe 2020 strategy, where sustainability is the objective of the plan.
(The sitting was suspended at 13.45 and resumed at 15.00)
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what happened in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and detrimental violation of the rights of an EU Member State.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by the debate by my fellow Members who, on the one hand, are talking about facilitation for small and medium-sized enterprises, but when it comes to the first step for micro-entities - and this is the only thing that we are talking about today - have a tendency to say'no' immediately again.
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage this waste, which is intended to ensure that it is no longer dangerous, and the approval of regulatory bodies that are stricter and prevent infringements of this directive.
Our aim should be a total transition to renewable energy sources by 2050.
It is absolutely necessary to apply existing regulations, and I think your comments on navigation, etc., are useful in this debate.
The fact that the European Union has an ageing population is regrettable in another place in the document.
I think it is up to us, as Parliament, to strive for more dynamic decisions when responding to the challenges that beset Europe, while not forgetting transparency in the management of funds.
At the same time, it is absolutely absurd and unacceptable for MEPs to have to ask the Commission behind closed doors about the content of the agreements that we are about to vote on.
I would also like to highlight the positive relationship between public and private actions in terms of stimulating compensation for victims, including in terms of setting out a five-year period for lodging actions.
I join the rapporteur in assessing his positive efforts to consolidate the management of financial and human resources, as well as to improve the functioning and effectiveness of internal control functions in 2008.
We can usually assess Russia's commitment to resolving such conflicts, but the fact is that in Transnistria, as well as Georgia and Ukraine, Russia cannot resist interfering in their internal affairs.

The region of Campania and the Italian State are generally working on the creation of a waste disposal network in accordance with European legislation.
The market will, above all, make it safer and more competitive.
I therefore ask the President of Parliament to intervene hard to obtain an answer in relation to this attack.
In Europe, we dream of freedom of expression being a fundamental value.
(DE) Mr President, there are real problems in all countries which are experiencing a crisis.
We would like to call on the Council to stop making the point of order from Parliament, and the end of it should also stop doing something of itself.
For this reason, my group and I support this directive because it represents an important step on the part of Parliament, a step that will have a positive impact on the lives of Europe's citizens.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on consumer rights tabled by the Commission is to merge four previous directives into a single legal instrument.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, particularly Mr S√°nchez Presedo, on behalf of the Socialists and Mrs Bowles, who have worked very successfully with me on the compromise text that I am presenting to you today as a report on the Commission White Paper.
(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the interest devoted to this debate by the authors of the question can be seen of the fact that not one more is in the Chamber, and that is why they did not hear what Mrs Inese Vaideree said just now, that Russia's genuine visa policy was a weapon which was not used to intensify the naturalisation process in Latvia, but to achieve the true repeat.
However, I believe that the work we have done is justified by optimism.
In my opinion, the EU should give due consideration to this possibility during the forthcoming dialogue negotiated by the High Representative.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate expresses the unresolved problems of economic policy in Europe.
Moreover, the Commission's research strategy aims to provide an appropriate guarantee of the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis throughout the entire framework programme.

We must state clearly that illegal employment will no longer tolerate.
in writing. - (LT) Media sending is one of the most important sources of information available to citizens in EU Member States and is therefore an important factor in creating people's values and opinions.
Nobody in the world can understand that.
If some do not want to go home, they can request political asylum from their prisoners.
If this is not a slow to a state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of the public expression of our homosexual and forestry citizens, then what is that?
It will not only benefit individual entrepreneurs from these measures because, at the same time, the European market will become more competitive compared to other economic powers such as the United States, China and Japan.
It is impossible to exclude, prevent or presuppose all the events that may occur in air transport.
Here, too, the situation has improved.
At the same time, it follows the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council, which stressed the need to reduce the school drop-out rate in Europe, and which also sets the collective target of reducing this rate by 10% by 2020.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of children fall victim each year to the victim of child traffickers and are even more abducted.
Good governance and EU regional policy (
It should not be forgotten that GDP is a production measure that does not measure environmental sustainability, for example.
Such cooperation makes the life of the rapporteur very easier.
Therefore, from a political point of view, it is absolutely essential that we vote in favour of this text, and in view of the debates we had, the complete change of opinion of Mrs Wallis, as well as of the other parts, is completely unfounded.
In addition, this supports both the study carried out by the Swiss Constitution for comparative law and the 2009 report by Mrs Schaldemose.
(NL) Mr President, I will begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his very active and committed efforts in the interests of public health and patient mobility, and I wish him a speedy recovery.
The recent problems in European air transport have highlighted once again the important role played by passenger transport and the cost of organising today's society.
Secondly, we voted against it, above all because you are using the attention that normally pays to victims to create a new fallout effect in terms of immigration.
Moreover, in the report addressed to several governments, they expressed their opposition to some strategies such as those aimed at tax reductions.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the package we are going to vote on tomorrow would be nothing without the will of the European Parliament, and I would like to take the opportunity to appreciate the work that has been done.
Unfortunately, it can no longer provide a reliable basis for political discussions, because it is not a measure of environmental sustainability or social inclusion.
I think that this matter should be discussed at the G20 Summit.
The next item is the Commission statement on the efficiency of European agencies in the areas of employment, working conditions and training.
It is true that the noble role of human rights is too often falling very deeply and the lawyers rich in defending the dubious rights of terrorists, criminals and non-fugitives.
Today, the European Parliament is demanding the immediate release of Dawit Isaak and other journalists detained in Eritrea.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the additional EUR 10 million which Parliament approved at the end of 2008 for the European Refugee Fund.
Patients are, today, increasingly committed to seeking health information, so that they can actively participate in the decisions relating to their health.
They are dismayed and concerned about the possibility of being cut off from the labour market.
Unless there is paragraph 1, all this will be meaningless - and paragraph 1 itself will be meaningless, in which we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with ambitious objectives.
the report by Mr Grech, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on ensuring the Single Market for consumers and citizens;
Realistic criteria must be set for increasing employment, especially young people's employability.
I think one good thing is that we are all concerned about research and know that it is the only hope for Europe and the Member States.
I want to say that it was not right for the Presidency to unanimously condemn the article in Swedish newspapers.
Measures are needed to keep late payments in commercial transactions under control to safeguard the good state of the European economy by preventing situations in which financial structures are undernourished and financial products sold, thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector.
It is absurd to support imports of products that do not even fit the quality criteria that our producers have to meet.
Finally, there are huge challenges ahead of us and the aim of ensuring unity at European level, strategically engaging with the most important external partners and fully maintaining our commitment to the Multilateral Climate Package, but we need to learn a lot from the COP 15 conference.
It should therefore be based on real problems, asked significant questions and focus on concrete measures, which will bring added value to people's everyday lives.
Oral questions and written declarations (tabling): see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would like to thank the rapporteur very much once again for his constructive approach.
I welcome Parliament's amendment contributing to the protection of bees, which play a key role in pollination important for farmers and the supply of food.
In this way, we can encourage users to make decisions for greener vehicles or modes of transport in the long term, to use less congested infrastructure or to travel in other times.
In the area of security, we are concerned about Iran's attitude and about the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan.
I think it is important that we enter the negotiations in order to ensure that the best solution to the problem is the solution that requires everyone's common commitment.
We need to know which Member States have high standards and which have them low.
On the other hand, other states have decided, for reasons that seem to reflect their narrow-minded interests towards applicants, to take advantage of the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of this area and are again trying to keep them outside.
I am very pleased that agreement has been reached on this text, which aims to enable flight slots to be frozen during the summer season.
That is why, for example, we need to analyse what happened in Detroit in order to try to avoid errors, but we must not react after any attack on a hasty response, because the result will probably be the adoption of measures that would simply not make sense in some cases.
As a minimum, the work of full-time mothers for pension contributions must be recognised.
Any other insidious and unfounded political attacks will be meaningless.
In this context, Europe's attitude could be agreed: of course, we need external supplies, we need security of supply and major and innovative projects such as Desertec, but we also need to ensure that people, companies and businesses, as well as households, can have greater control of their energy and energy budgets in terms of price, efficiency and the environment.
For these reasons, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the proposals that require an impact assessment and will vote in favour of Mr Sturdy's amendment, which I myself have signed, which covers endocrine disrupters, and those that will enable plant protection products to be made available in the event of emergency.
It is scandalous that the same working countries are once again being asked to pay for the mistakes of others.
For some time now, Europe has been involved in this region: EUR 1 billion per year in Afghanistan, EUR 300 million in Pakistan, the EUPOL mission, which is invaluable in the face of personnel problems, the international observation mission, and, of course, the commitments of individual states in the ISAF mission.
That is one point.
Another necessary measure is for India to establish and introduce a number of transparent and clear procurement regulations which will also enable European companies to gain access to these markets.
With a proper impact assessment and clarification of the various legal options and objectives, along with a clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure, the implementation of long-term strategic projects aimed at building a stronger EU will then be easier.
As part of this process, the ratification of a new treaty on the restriction of strategic weapons (START), which is still waiting for approval in the US Congress.
It is becoming increasingly mobile and the recent risk analysis shows that organised crime is increasingly involved in cyberspace.
I also believe, as has already been said, that we have clarified the critical points, especially when it comes to group supervision.
I am committed to working with this President of the European Council, because such a partnership will be a significant improvement.
What is positive, however, is that the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers sent to consular authorities and to international organisations tasked with preventing illegal immigration and allowing the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
People were right to say that the Brandenburg gate was at the cost of freedom.
Firstly, the communication identifies how good governance can be improved within the European Union in the area of taxation to support the argument for other jurisdictions to follow.
At the beginning of this speech, I spoke about an unbearable choice, and the Commission knows what roads it wishes to take.
However, it is clear that if the obstinacy of the two main parties in the country continues, then this will never be achieved.
Your contribution, in my opinion, is all the more important than this, is that the current situation is making the Member States take tough decisions, where, in my view, it is essential to protect research and innovation as an investment for the future, and I can assure you that I will inform the Council of the content of this debate and keep you available.
We should happily recognise the right to democracy and parliamentary sovereignty in the 27 Member States.

It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to end torture, investigate all cases of misuse of peaceful demonstrators and stop the trials with civilians in military courts.
There are even cases where, at the same time, there are different national systems in one country.
The answer, therefore, is to have more democracy and not more extreme right-wing policy, hostility towards people and cynical contempt.
It is naive to put hopes on an EU-wide common database, with all the different languages and information systems, when millions of poorly attempted to create a database of health services for the UK alone were wasted.
In October 2010, the Commission adopted a communication entitled'Towards a Single Market Act' to relaunch the Single Market.
Once again, in order to ensure legal certainty and predictability, the EU must now propose an effective, transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors, including the smallest (for example, small and medium-sized enterprises).
This proposal for an EU tax is unconstitutional.
We need a plan B, as has rightly been said, and the railway system is the alternative.
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for providing an additional sum of EUR 3 million from the EU budget for 2008 to restore cultural heritage in war-hit regions in the Western Balkans.
In addition, the Member States are obliged to ensure that return operations do not take place in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is obliged by the Member States to ensure that the person is not returned to their own country if she is threatened with persecution or serious attack when she is returned.
This would enable you to achieve greater efficiency than if you decided to use the opt-out to allow the various funds to function independently.
It is particularly important that when legislating at EU level, particular attention is paid to the particular vulnerability of women and children subjected to domestic violence.
I hope that, after all 26 elected assemblies have decided, people will not hinder this democratic process from administration by denying their signatures.
The 2010 progress report on Iceland
There are also significant differences in terms of the extent to which there are proven cases of violence against women in the various Member States.
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes
For me, the crucial issue is raising awareness, and I think these reports will help achieve this.
The next item is the vote.
It is important to understand that we are now moving from an intergovernmental approach to a Community approach, and I am very pleased with the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs.
Let us not forget, however, that efforts for the good of the child must remain at the forefront.
Instead of completely eliminating micro-entities from the fourth directive, we should clearly define a more moderate demand for a regulation and implement it within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives.
When armed conflicts break out where the international institutions are no longer safe, such a situation is very serious.

Ireland has now decided to hold a second referendum.
I welcome the initiative of the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, who is asking the European Union to officially recognise the Roma population genocide perpetrated by the Nazis and their allies during the Second World War, because this initiative represents a step forward in the fight for the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that our fellow Member, Mr Cohn-Bendit, has called President - Prime Minister - a dictator in Hugo Ch√°vez's style, has not respected the principles of democracy.
One of the proposed models for taxation of financial transactions is the Tobin tax.
Extreme poverty, discrimination and marginalisation continue to affect a large number of Roma throughout Europe, and that is why it is high time for redress.
It is the duty of society to ensure this free choice and not to discriminate against activity only because it does not fit in normal cases in the formal labour market.
Over the course of my 30 years of professional experience in the field of accounting and auditing, I have never seen an auditing entity give auditing to the auditor of auditing how it is to do its work.
It is good that Parliament pays more attention to the implementation and transposition of the legislation that we are adopting here.
I am thinking of the abolition of duties on textile products imported from Pakistan, which would result in the loss of hundreds of jobs in Lombardy and throughout the rest of Europe.
Membership of committees: see Minutes
The radical changes in European rural areas have entailed all of them in terms of settlements, jobs, services and the environment.

I expect balanced, short-term and medium-term commitments from Copenhagen and verifiable commitments, as well as financial penalties in the event of non-compliance.
The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) therefore voted against this proposal and wants all the disproportionate losses to be borne by the parties concerned.
I am raising these questions because, while I am pleased with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February, I have grave doubts about whether we Europeans actually manage this situation.
They will hear that Europe has been divided once and a high wall has been built in its middle: people in the East were very poor, they did not have democracy and they lived under a bad regime called communism, killing millions of their own people.
I remind you that the Polish Parliament approved the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April this year, but the ratification documents have not yet been signed by the President.
I share this in my assessment of the Commission's proposal and would like to point out a few veto about how important such activities are.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Most importantly, the negotiations are open, and Parliament is ready to do so.
We consider possible charges made against these people to be unjustified and I can assure you that we will urge the competent authorities in every way possible to resolve the whole matter satisfactorily for us, which means that these people are released.

These are the following tasks: the first is a move towards a common immigration policy; the second is a significant improvement in the organisation of legal migration; the third is to improve integration procedures; the ultimate challenge is to combat illegal or secret immigration; the fifth is the further development of Frontex.
After this Irish'yes', we know that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force, we know this because this was the last obstacle.

The European Union must act as a model for strengthening both the rules and efforts in the area of solidarity.

(LT) Minister, thank you for the efforts you have made as a country conducting the Presidency in the fight against poverty.
Without a global agreement, I think all our efforts will be wasted.
I would like to highlight one paragraph in the Commission's draft statement, which is annexed to the proposal.
These three reports maintain the spirit and prudent incentives which are typical of the new strategy for the internal market for Professor Mario Monti, and are a successful expression of the single purpose of relaunching the European Single Market through 50 measures that are then repeated and summed up or emphasised in the 14 priorities of this House.
The governments of the Gulf countries are reacting in a variety of ways: significant financial packages to ensure the most urgent and social needs, political reform announcements, the transfer of some legislative powers to elected authorities or the opening of complex and open national dialogues.
As far as Mr Ziobra's argument is concerned, there is no problem with the intervention of the Strasbourg Court by the powers of the Union.
I would raise all these issues again during the negotiations on the reform of the POSEI programme.
in writing. - I would like to echo the admiration expressed in the debate on the courage of the people of Tunisia and Egypt, who have expressed their dissatisfaction and disappointment at their regimes.
Therefore, I simply cannot understand why we cannot treat the same kind of programme from this perspective.
The European Union has introduced legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to employees affected by the consequences of extensive structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market.
The wide thrust of the final text and the guarantees of consumer rights that this text ensures pay tribute to its negotiating capacities.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposal to impose an obligation on the EU Member States to report to the Commission on the activities of their export credit agencies in terms of risk calculation and to provide information on management operations and calculation of social and environmental risks.
Mrs Ronzulli, please sit down and stop talking.
This is an important fact, which demonstrates Parliament's willingness and ability to offer itself as a candidate playing a central role in the CFSP, or as a CFSP, on the basis of what I call a dynamic interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon.
I therefore support this report in general, but provided that the Member States retain their central role in managing, identifying and protecting wilderness.
And, after a long journey of a few months, I will not, first of all, share this Parliament's desire for the service to start operating, to express the needs of the electorate that you represent, and for it to be a service that will serve them well.
That concludes this point.
This subject could have been discussed at the summit and other issues.
Georgia's territorial integrity must remain unquestionable.
So, as you can see, they are almost on the same level.
Therefore, this debate is important to recall that the Commission has committed itself this year, in 2009, to presenting Parliament with a communication aimed at evaluating possible pan-European threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information, and to drawing attention to the importance of drawing up a directive guaranteeing the pluralism of information in relation to new technologies and, in particular, television.
The effective application of the directive in terms of assessing and compensating the shortcomings observed in the process of transposing, as well as the implementation of the directives adopted earlier, would supplement the possibility of defending the citizens of the European Union against discrimination.
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report because it highlights the importance of European political parties as indispensable actors in the political life of the EU and puts forward concrete proposals in order to create a safe and transparent regulatory environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties.
Therefore, if we are to achieve the objectives we are setting ourselves here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means that we will need not less, but more money in the future.
Mr Yanukovich won the elections democratically and became President, albeit with little difference.
We need strong economic governance at EU level at a time when the impact of the recession and the public debt crisis is dramatically felt.
The joint debate is closed.
The rapporteur deems all the conditions for the abolition of border controls with Bulgaria and Romania to be met, but he wants the European Parliament to continue to be informed of the additional measures to be taken with regard to the border between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration.
I am pleased to note that the regulation on the rights of air passengers has shown the utmost importance, which is that it has provided a safety net to ensure that the burden of disruptions is not passengers and that they are not paralysed by chaos.
As was the case in 2004, the Presidency of the Council will be called on to elect a candidate for this important office from the main European parliamentary group, and the role of Parliament will be to express its opinion on 15 July on his choice, which will be one of the first major political steps of the new parliamentary term.
We must ask all political forces to put an end to this crisis, otherwise it can lead to the isolation of Albania and to the threat of its European prospects.
I agreed with this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
I also insist that we must demand freedom for all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba anywhere else in the world, but I would nevertheless recommend not to adopt measures that have already proven to be a failure to move forward with Cuba towards democracy and liberalisation, namely the embargo and the blockade.
I wish for the citizens of Sri Lanka that the expression I have so often heard -'war is an institution' - finally belongs to the past.

Like Mr Tajani, I, too, would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Barrot's work, which was very important, as well as to the will shown by the French Presidency.
This Parliament has been impoverished by its presence, but the Swedish Presidency certainly has benefited from this.
Europe must guarantee that we will be much more effective in terms of energy consumption.
Its role is the procurement of goods and services, with the most favourable ratio of prices and quality.
Despite this, however, I am pleased with the Swedish social democrats that you have, in the end, heard our demands and demands of Parliament for the inclusion of a greater proportion of the issue of women's rights and children's rights in this programme.
It is clear that different types of changes are taking place in the Member States.
It has become the opposite of what these organisations intended to do.
(FR) Mr President, Parliament's resolution shows that, in this area too - as many others have done - our institution has absolutely no ability to judge on the dogmas.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see two major problems in relation to the amendment to Article 136, one of which is institutional and the other political.
It is therefore a step in the right direction.
Nevertheless, I do not agree with linking the fight against HIV to such a sensitive issue as abortion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the 2007 annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy, I would like to highlight some important issues and positions of the Committee on Budgets.
In any part that focuses more specifically on a particular area, it proposes only to deal with some extreme cases of poverty, discrimination, etc. through measures such as the approval of the minimum wage, etc. the fact that there is no reference to anti-democratic decisions and persecution of citizens, such as the ban on the communist parties and other organisations, and the imprisonment of Communists and other political fighters in the EU Member States, in Central Europe and the Baltic Sea Region the Baltic Sea Region.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
We must put a stop to free trade policy, we must stop the free movement of capital, we must promote food sovereignty, we must declare water and energy as global public goods and we must combat socio-economic disparities.
firstly, that after 2013, the future of agriculture in the Community must be safeguarded;
The question arises here, for me, as to whether these are existing projects, which are already financed from cohesion policy sources or new projects.
That is why, following President Mubarak's speech today, after the regime leaked off its dogs and after preparing the path of violence, we must say that we are going to stand shoulder to those people.
Today, I would like to thank the former President of Parliament, Mr Borrello, and Mr P√∂ttering, and Parliament's Committee on Petitions for their support for Michael's fight for justice.

I can add that this is not the direction in which the Commission has taken, as its proposal has been concentrated - through the regulation adopted by this Parliament - on reforming the current system of agencies that are private and on a very strict consolidation of transparency requirements in order to prevent conflicts of interest and honour in assessing credit.
The European Commission also calls for an evaluation of the costs and benefits of establishing a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.

The bank has not noticed that a major crisis is on the verge of the crisis, and it is not so much in terms of its regulation, which is far from perfect.

Mr Rapkay's report on the amendment to the Staff Regulations concerning the establishment of the European External Action Service is a very important document on the path to the Union's foreign policy.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA committee for these reports, which raise important issues concerning the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to the achievement of some fundamental public policy objectives: respect for human rights, efforts for economic wellbeing and social justice, achieving sustainable growth and respect for the environmental and partly climate system.
Consumers will be entitled to claim damages if there is no remedy available if they purchase a product that is not in line with the treaty.
Mr President, the reason for this urgency is the brutal mass murder of 57 people who accompanied the politicians on her way to register at the elections for the position of Governor of the provincial state.
This new smart metrical system will mean stricter supervision, more in-depth evaluation of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, and drawing up recommendations for additional reforms and correction plans.
The Syrian people deserve long-awaited political reforms, especially with regard to freedom of expression, association, political participation and governance.
Many of them were citizens of the United Kingdom with whom they were traded within my country, not from external sources, if I may use this expression.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the third quarter of 2009, the European Union returns to growth, on the basis of which we thought that the worst is behind us.
In this context, Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration, stepping up pension reform and health reform, improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the system of wage negotiation, encouraging the operation of the market in products and the business environment, and maintaining the stability of the banking and financial sector.
We believe that it is still essential to remember when implementing agreements between sovereign states: respect for the sovereignty of the country and its peoples, mutual interest, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account each country's particularities; an assessment of the contribution each of the parties can make to the relevant agreement in economic, social and cultural terms.
I think that the transition to a sustainable green economy will continue without the excessive legislative measures being taken.
Everyone seems to forget the extent to which the US and, of course, NATO have contributed to peace in Europe.
I think we should view this as a good opportunity to address what Europe needs desperately: economic growth, jobs, a dynamic sector of small businesses, more effective public procurement - these are things that our citizens will assess.
I think it is not our job to predict possible developments in these countries.
The second project concerns concessions.
Madam President, when Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace during the elections to the European Parliament in 2004, we met the angry constituents outside restaurants and public buildings.
At a time of intense secrecy in terms of state activity, increasing the EU's budget is an act that expresses confidence in the common project and means strengthening the measures taken at supranational level.
I know we will have good news, so let us send it there and let us extend it.
This report contains guidelines on how air agreements are to be analysed in terms of the content and procedures to be adopted.
The asylum law creates imbalances.
Perhaps when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force on 1 December, we will be able to leave British domestic policy in front of the doors of this Chamber.
That is the difference between the real situation and the European Parliament's air muscle.
Furthermore, we support the idea that every national parliament must be fully involved in accordance with its budgetary and control rights in order to increase transparency, ownership and responsibility for the decisions taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we have five questions on the table plus other two that concern economic governance and the Europe 2020 strategy.
I therefore believe that we should actively involve national authorities, the European Commission, as well as Members of this House, in promoting SOLVIT.
It is a system based on real policy and guidelines and, Mr Michel, on protagonists and liberal rhetoric, which has led to the current situation, and here we have the support of the agro-industrial model in line with the protection of the interests of large agri-food enterprises and the consequent high-quality impoverishment of the agricultural sector, years and years of under-investment in agriculture, leaving the small and medium-sized sector, and therefore, and poor food facilities, and agricultural sector.
As far as the economic aspect is concerned: the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs and the CAP must ensure that this problem is resolved.
Once again, I urge the Commission, in its dealings with the government, to constantly press for this promise to be delivered until the law collection occurs in Congo.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I fully understand the considerable interest of this Parliament in the measures taken within and outside the Union in order to address the problems that some Member States are facing in terms of their public finances.
We sympathise with the will of the peoples who want a better life, a strengthening of their position and a better tomorrow.
You are even supported by the Irish members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
We should, and indeed must, strive for this new dimension of European foreign policy in order for the world to be more free, fairer and social in the future.
It is my office that drew up a working document on sanctions against Syria, so we stand at the helm.
The day when we successfully rid ourselves of poverty, the eyes of Communism will disappear forever.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the revision of competition rules in terms of horizontal cooperation by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B7-0565/2010).
You have fought for this together, irrespective of their relevance to the blue or orange.
I believe that this procedure not only strengthens the EU's food security, but also introduces greater clarity for Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.
From this point of view, it seems risky to continue with the Mercosur agreement, especially as the Swedish Food and Technology Republic has pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35th times higher than the Irish one.
Under the agreement with the Council, the following text should be added to the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is paragraph 2 (b) of the amendment):'the annual review of the value of charges by Articles 4b, 4b and 66b and paragraph 3, where these charges are not mentioned in the euro, the same reference rate will be used'.
The Irish Government has now requested European solidarity, and rightly gained it.
One only has to look at Ireland - a country that has hit the crisis particularly hard: membership of monetary union has protected it from the crisis from an even greater scale.
It fears German claims for Sudeten properties and, while listening to German politicians when they spoke on this subject, I think his concerns are completely justified.
an increase in support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as greater financial support for the training and implementation of projects;
If we do not introduce something that will make countries realise that, if they implement economically irrational policies, we will have severe consequences, we will get nowhere.
We must support and promote further activities to tackle climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always on similar complex issues, I have received a great deal of cooperation from my own shadow team, who formed BerPrete Vergnaud, Cristian Bu≈üoi and Heide R√ºhle.
Freedom of the press and of the media are indeed a serious problem in Russia.
It is also up to the Member States to decide whether or not to ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, two important instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.
It is therefore a structured dialogue that enables us to exchange views on issues that concern us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, so that people who are already in work can be protected and given some support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and that they do not have to undergo a retraining cycle and an upgrading of skills during the next one to two years, in order to win new jobs; but that existing jobs will be retained.
Madam President, our questions have been formulated with a view to highlighting the benefit that our citizens can expect from a package of measures, and what we are able to offer in such a package.
I voted in favour of the report because it also brings certain significant improvements to the wording of the European Commission's proposals concerning, in particular, the protection of personal data.
In addition, we carried out a revision of unused funds in 2009, so it was possible to allocate a total of EUR 1.9 billion to energy and an additional EUR 420 million to broadband Internet in category II.
Thank you for your proposal and for your very clear report.
We see something there, but it is in any case on the right track, and also an attempt at a comprehensive approach, which has not been achieved just as we imagined.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes cumbersome, and the Council, where we tried to find sensible solutions during the night negotiations and during many trialogue negotiations, because only an hour ago, too, they approved the reasonable compromise that we found.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, set up a European Air Transport Ministers' meeting on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the problem itself, in this case illegal logging, rarely creates the conditions for illegal trade in timber.
In fact, I come from Portugal, the Azores region, where the dairy sector is very important and located in regions that are socially vulnerable and where it would really be necessary to keep the quota system for longer than 2015.
People are not the result of different cultures, but different cultures are the result of different nations.
In some cases, it is so good that they deserve our consideration.
(SV) Iceland is a small nation in the sense of the population, with approximately 300 000 inhabitants, but it is a significant nation.
MEPs play an important role in reviewing health claims decisions.
For this reason, we agree with the Nabucco project in its final validity, but equally the final decision is for us to support our governments' efforts to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the wellbeing of our people.
It is possible to ban political parties, there is corruption in the legal system, human rights are violated, freedom of expression and association do not exist in the form that we know in countries such as Britain or most of the other European states.
It is also clear that we need a'energy mix', consisting of various energy sources, which are as diverse as possible, because it will stabilise the energy situation, and then it will come to its energy diversity, both in every country and in Europe.
However, I do have doubts in cases where Parliament refers to international law in condemning some despicable practices and the legal basis in these cases is far from obvious.
By voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my full support for the people of Tunisia and the historic democratic revolution which they started.
Furthermore, it calls on Member States to implement suitable and effective policies such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty, and to report regularly on their activities to address this problem.
If somebody in the Hungarian Parliament enters into law and this legislation into force, it will now be possible to amend it by only two thirds of a majority, and it is clear that after the next elections, this law will not be easy to amend again.
General tariff preferences (debate)
Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
The question of a new sense of mutual trust poses another major challenge for us.
This year we allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS, but the actual costs can only be evaluated after the first year of operation, when a report is submitted to the European Parliament on all expenditure relating to the EEAS's activities.
My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which, as we all know, is the crisis factor of the whole region, including Afghanistan.
However, we cannot forget the natural biological differences that exist between men and women.
We should not forget these factors, even with regard to the idea in the proposal to earmark revenue from infrastructure charges.
(HU) I welcome, within the framework of this directive, the clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of endless consultants and the proposed solution to the question of the unavailability of professionals in the home country.
Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I would like to comment directly on the issues and questions that have been raised.
Last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency in committee of being merely a fictitious Presidency.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the constant violations of human rights there, particularly with regard to freedom of association, expression and information, and because I support the aspirations of the Iranian people for democracy.
In particular, rapid initial financing will be important.
One thing is to create such a mechanism, but that must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens so that they can make full use of it.
Thanks to this agreement, not only will the Canadian and European markets become more competitive, but also safer, as regulators and enforcement bodies will cooperate more closely on all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest level of security for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
Moreover, his private aspect not only improves the image that Europe presents the world, but also supports European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the proposal we are debating today is to change the regulation approved in 2004, which improves and harmonises the safety standards relating to the protection of passports and travel documents of EU citizens against fraudulent use, while at the same time introducing elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, we need to establish a kind of temporary institutional framework for the implementing mechanisms of the decision.
It has to be said, however, that some of the agreements that we have recently adopted are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
For this reason, it is important that Parliament once again remind the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that its current approach, based on constructive cooperation with the European Union, is much more effective than constant attempts to translate history.
This may seem ridiculous, but to date, the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments either, nor has the time to influence the Latvian Government in order to put an end to discrimination on the basis of language.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make any form of assistance to the Pakistani Government conditional on the immediate elimination of this harmful discrimination against the religious minorities living in that country.
It will be an effective tool for bringing an end to illegal immigration, organised crime and trafficking in human beings.
This is acceptable and legitimate, and we have fought for it.
It is clear that, more than ever, financial institutions need to make a fauna and review their approach.
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, which we have also achieved in committee.
The main objective of aid for trade is to increase the domestic and foreign competitiveness of 48 states.
Although we accept the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, the old'polluter pays pays' principle is basically not tenable.
I was encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate.
In addition, we are concerned when we look at the starting point.
The main objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States, whether the centre-left or centre left, is to ensure the continued profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working class throughout the European Union.
Action must therefore be taken to disseminate best practice and raise awareness among local decision makers about the benefits that information and communication technologies bring.
We did not hear an interpretation of the previous speech to English.
There is, however, one very important aspect of this recast, this codification, which concerns the restructuring of the TEN-T networks over the next decade.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the people of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also very important for the citizens of the European Union, because Ukraine is an important partner for us, especially in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in Eastern Europe.
For this reason, the Commission must have a strong voice.
We cannot interfere in an issue for which the Government of the United States has a sole responsibility.
We are paying little or nothing to the people who care for our forests to secure these hidden functions, which many see as a matter of course.
Unfortunately, I have to say that the list of unresolved problems is more prolonged than crazy.
In view of Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would ask the Council and the Commission, which is now represented by Baroness Ashton, to act quickly on three matters.
There are large dealers who are in a strong position on the market in some Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are more satisfied with what we are proposing at the moment than with what we have been proposing since 2002, as they have seen that some aspects that the legislator did not plan in 2002 were not in their interests instead of making it difficult for them to face competition from large dealers.
It must establish the EU's regional policy partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa, as proposed by the Committee on Development in adopting its report in April 2007.
Over the years, and especially after the historic enlargement of 2004, the context and ambition of the Common Foreign and Security Policy have changed very much.
Spain is taking over the baton of the Presidency of the European Union just at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force.
In this context, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and that it is included in the Single Market Act's priority activities.
I would like to strongly support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's proposal has been amended in accordance with the report that is now being voted on, based on a recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading.
These are the people who are most in need and should not be excluded because of where they live.
All medical treatment, irrespective of its different features, falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that the recent study by the European cardiological company demonstrated once again that this methodology has serious shortcomings due to the low participation of women in such tests.
The intention is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but should also not prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives.
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste, especially in this largely agricultural region, so that data is controlled and a system of exchange of best practices is put in place.
The law which says that Orthodox priests, bishops and patriarchies must be Turkish citizens is completely incomprehensible.
The most important point of the position taken by Parliament is the warning of the imregular adoption of measures, and consequently the lack of cohesion, not only as a body of legislation, but especially in terms of implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has secured the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
One of the EU's priorities was at least the subject of a single digital market.
This would be an important step forward for the transparency, openness and clarity of the European procedure.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because it is clearly reasonable to discuss this matter.
Is this the economic development model that Europe is to propose for Europeans?
I do not permit the speakers to go over their speaking time, but I think we agree that Mrs Tzavela's speech was extremely important to us.
We want a proper strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment which, once implemented, will ultimately improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region.
It is indeed a great success, because if we do not now take into account the legal basis, this directive recognises the unquestionable right of patients and opens up new opportunities for them to access better treatment.
For years now, the Court of Auditors has been unable to be pleased that the EU budget has been legally and properly used, and when I was the main accountant of the European Commission in 2002, I was very concerned that we did not have sufficient control over taxpayers' money.
For me, it is also a huge task and a great honour.
If we are to be honest, we need to recognise our historic responsibility for climate change and our per capita emissions much higher than those in China or India, for example.
I am sure that the dialogue that will now follow will be constructive.
We therefore regret that the excessive haste has considered the desire to defend fundamental freedoms, as in the case of Europol.
I agree with the Commission's proposal, which aims to add another, simpler method of using the European Social Fund reserve to ensure that its response to the economic and social challenges that Europe is facing is quicker and more effective.
Frankly, I had to vote against the proposed composition of the Commission, but together with weak candidates, some very good candidates were also nominated, including the Polish candidate Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but, in fact, there are 26 other Member States in the European Union apart from Britain, so you will understand that, although we are very sensitive to the concerns that you have expressed, I must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I think that we need to be careful here to maintain the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian aid, even though it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
In addition, it adds other points to what Parliament has already said in the past, such as the request for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations by all parties and report to the European Parliament on the basis of the draft resolution, while at the same time noting that the responsibility and credibility of the investigations carried out by the Goldstone NGOs and their preparations are fully monitored.
I also hope that this decision will help to save migrant fish species.
I hope that you will not treat my questions as a provocation, but as a subject of consideration.
I am always willing - and I hope that I will be able to do so - to come back here and explain our results, but we need to check what we find out.
This outcome will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in international trade negotiations, especially in the ongoing negotiations of the World Trade Organisation in Doha.
When Europe is united in this area, the United States of America will also accept this objective.
For this reason, I personally support the prices set for European tobacco growers, at least until the people of Europe smoke.
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries are taking this issue more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see the European Social Fund (ESF) separate from European structural policy.
In addition, even in the decades to come, the number of newly infected people still exceeds the available treatment opportunities available and two thirds of people who needed treatment did not receive treatment in 2009, which means that 10 million sick people did not have access to the necessary effective treatment.
If respect is respected for human dignity, we do not let minorities in any way in negative terms.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
All EU institutions should ensure in the future that the aim of our budgets is to help individuals and businesses overcome difficult economic times and plan economic recovery.
The quickest route towards their blending, much more effective and efficient than all the measures for top-down, is to support the activities of civil initiatives, cultural organisations and regional institutions.
Anyone who speaks out against this treaty yet today in the naive belief that it is a treaty that strengthens the European Union, I would say: those who speak out against this treaty essentially strengthen our so-called partners or, let us say, our opponents.
The European Union has taken on global capitalism in a way that destroys us all.
We will soon have a TEN-T transport network meeting, where the Commission will press ahead with further development of the network of other modes of transport.
You will remember that this was a passionate dispute, because it came before the Court of Justice and the Commission - and I must give credit to the Commission - acted rationally, much more rationally than the Council, and we fully supported the Commission.
The first person who asked to take the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, the line being taken by the governments of the EU's main Member States, the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified.
I would remind the House that, according to the last reading of the people in the European Union, we have over 20 million unemployed people, with this figure reaching probably up to 25 million at the moment, which means that the quest of other asylum seekers is actually a certain common suicide.
The penalties must be imposed by the Commission and not by the finance ministers.
The economic recovery in Sri Lanka depends on foreign direct investment and EU economic support.
We fully support the objective of this foundation, but we could not support the quotation that refers to other Parliament's vote, which advocates, among other things, the interruption of pregnancy and contradicts the previous explanations of vote that we tabled before Parliament.
This document is the result of a compromise reached following lengthy negotiations, which will facilitate the implementation of passenger rights without simultaneously imposing an additional burden on carriers.
It is, in fact, high time that the'E' write in the short of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) received life-maker inflation by creating real and effective economic union as a final step in the integration of European economic policy.
I have taken seriously the issue of the rights of the child in the context of external relations.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has been trying for ten years to equip itself with legislative instruments in the field of economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for restricting national administrative and technical obstacles preventing the marketing of construction products in the European Union and for further building of the Single Market in this sector.
I think that before we can send back to Libya the migrants who are staying illegally in the EU, there is still a long way to go if we really want to meet the objectives we have set in the treaties for our foreign policy.
I therefore supported the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships in the framework of the flagship initiative'Innovation Union', and I think we should all be involved in innovation measures because, as I said, they are very important for the future.
We have a new government in the UK that has promised something in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand, thereby producing positive results both in environmental protection and in the creation of jobs.
Some countries do not use all the ESF resources at their disposal, and around 30 or 40% remain unused.
I therefore wonder about the style - when the Commission even said that it had information and that it publishes them - that there is a duty to publish them - why, for example, this was not known.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal to conduct an effective information campaign to make points of single contact more visible.
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to combat the economic crisis and wants implementation of the economic policy objectives to be mandatory.
Today, I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection because I believe that blocking in the Council as a result of the language regime is unfounded.
I repeat: the Treaty makes it clear that a Member State cannot be forced to take on its debts.
I would like to recall the joint agreement of the European Parliament and the Council to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
I would like to assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues at the highest level as well, thereby recalling the international commitments of the People's Republic of China in the field of human rights.
I hope and believe that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement.
Firstly, I regret the fact that my colleague, Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, is not among us.
You may not be aware of this, but there is a need for extensive animal testing, for example, to check such a statement.
What causes me less suspicion, Commissioner, is the considerable influence of CARS 21 and the impact of this sector in the process initiated here.
We do not agree with that.
EU aid planned for 2007-2013, which aims to promote the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova, amounts to more than EUR 50 million.
We cannot, of course, understand why a person who accepts an undeclared worker should be punished in order to cover his costs of housing and livelihood.
I believe that this measurement system, based on certifying the parameters of the various studies, will lead to political decisions that are more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to stress that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on and directly linked to the elimination of restrictions on freedoms and the suppression of participation in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists.
Finally, High Representative, you will travel to the Middle East.
Even one month after the establishment of the International Criminal Court in July 2002, the US Congress suffered from the approval of a law on the protection of US Army.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to briefly remind you that this report contains amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following the resolution adopted in this plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal to authorise the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption, even if it passed anti-small-scale modifications.
Madam President, first of all, I want to express my deepest condolences for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concern for the four other Cuban prisoners and one opposition activist who also began a hunger strike.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 relating to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Stockholm Programme).
Not a cent should be wasted by our motto.
The Union, especially the Mediterranean countries, has always been at the forefront when it comes to delivering the humanitarian aid of the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity with people living in such problematic conditions is very important.
Employers themselves are often isolated and it is very difficult to gain access to trade unions in this situation.
(Laughter and applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the Commissioner, the Commissioner and the Commission for their comments today.
Mrs Guillaume's report is in its present form, although some of the amendments have helped to improve it, a real incentive for people to exploit this process, block the relevant services and prevent those who really need it quickly from resolving their case.
It is up to us, and in our responsibility, to do all we can, and I thank both authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work for the benefit of all of us.
We did indeed install a huge programme with some big and important reports.
The so-called social dumping poses a great threat to workers because it fundamentally undermines their rights.
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, in relation to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of each proposal, I should like to ask him whether an ex ante study can be carried out for the area in question, also on the basis of an assessment of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific nature of the area, so that the criteria that each country will have to take into account at the outset and comply with in its planning.
We must also look at the issue of the Roma, which is experiencing extreme poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and the problems of young Roma, whose lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to access employment during the economic crisis.
in writing. - (PT) I was pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aims to extend the scope of intervention in the housing sector to help marginalised communities in all Member States.
It also recalls all policy makers within their competence that, if we want to have effective press freedom, public authorities must play a role in this: they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and support its development.
Mr President, I think that the European Union has grown up too much, there are too many cultures in it, and I simply do not believe in this system at all and it will be even worse.
It is too early to report the results of this analysis and, as the honourable Member will understand, each step in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to note that the prospect of EU integration serves as the strongest incentive for the Balkan countries to carry out the necessary reforms and, at the same time, serve as a factor of stability in the region.
Now that advertising plays an even greater role, it is essential that we lay down criteria that will enable consumers and patients to be fully aware of and to be sure what kind of effects these medicines have.
In the words expressed by Neil Armila, it would be a small step for the European funds, but a big step for the entire European economy.
Thirdly, the security loopholes that have been referred to time and again if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not exist.
Moreover, the rapid disruption of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has enabled the offer of online gambling to be increased and cross-border issues that remain unresolved to arise.
Those who take decisions in this area, as well as those seeking asylum, should have the same access to technical information about the country of origin of the applicant and the authorities where the treatment of appeals is a competence.
Therefore, I appreciate the important step that has been taken after so many years by the creation of a single transnational parliament in a world elected on the basis of universal electoral law.
Twenty seven Member States of the European Union spend EUR 200 billion a year on defence, and we need to spend this EUR 200 billion better than it was in the past.
We have changed this together.
In addition, we will also be dealing with services of general interest during this Parliamentary Assembly.
I would suggest, therefore, that we allow Mr Almunia, for example, the former Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, as he was quite critical of certain countries during his function, and then the problems of Greece have arisen.
From this point of view, Turkey very urgently needs reform.
