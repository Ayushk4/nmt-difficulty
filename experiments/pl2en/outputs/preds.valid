Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them.

President of the Commission. - Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis.
The conclusions of the report, which is the subject of debate in the European Parliament last Wednesday, make it clear to us that importing agricultural products from third countries has a much more adverse impact on the environment than on internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, thus leading to climate change.
It is, in fact, difficult to recognise that the countries we offer these funds cannot benefit from them.
Dates for next sittings: see Minutes
The Member States' maritime institutions must cooperate much more closely with each other in order to harmonise training programmes, as well as offer payment capacity for traineeships and exchanges of experience between European maritime enterprises.
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe.
It is to be seen that we are demanding more and more of our farmers.
The Frontex agency must be strengthened and the EU must force the authorities in the Member States to fulfil their commitments.
I would like to add one more point which no one has so far raised, with the exception of Commissioner Almunia.
Above all, sensitive areas are water resources, agriculture, energy, forestry and biodiversity, and, last but not least, people's health.
Let me also express on behalf of the Commission and on behalf of the Commission the regret the death of nine Turkish soldiers and Gendarmerie forces last week as a result of a terrorist attack.
Mr Piebalgs, congratulations on everything you do.
However, it is encouraging that, in view of the opposition expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education to the deterioration of education and training policies, especially at a time when unemployment is increasing, causing problems in many Member States of the European Union, the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments that I supported and has increased the initial measures (for the 150202 for lifelong learning programmes).
Then a minority government was in power with completely different political views, but no one considered this to be a coup d'état.
The fact that we - the international community - have looked at how the Abyei case remains unresolved demonstrates a lack of accountability and confirms the possibility of a resumption of war in the future.
The example of the Romanian football card, Marian Cozma, who was brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian community, shows once again that crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community has the opposite effect.
You therefore need to establish a sound EU food policy.
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new policy model in Europe, both in terms of the need to pool the resources of the Member States in order to achieve the best results and to work on joint strategies and actions, which will also make Europe the political union that it was dreaming of its founding fathers many years ago.
That is our request.
We all support the Single Market - Hungary has done this right from the outset.
The inevitable climate change forces the public and the economy of the European Union to adapt to the new realities.
Different countries will continue to support internal stability and help to find socio-economic solutions, as well as ethnic tensions.
These were three years of wonderful'Roma' and (like the majority of the short-term Italian honey) that is what ends up in my satisfaction, too.
The need for NATO to maintain its constant vigilance and to receive support, especially now in Afghanistan.
We need to start with something and we need to give a boost to this.
It will therefore be necessary to address common aspects, such as reduced VAT rates, VAT exemption, the possibility of setting the maximum rates and the place of taxation of supply in EU internal trade.
I would like to talk a little about the West Midlands: we have the greatest youth unemployment and our automotive industry has been decimated by the fact that, in part, providing finance for employment in Slovakia, the European Union has lost jobs in the Ryton plant.
It is absolutely necessary to ensure that these newly created institutions are not undermined or undermined by underlying reform of the financial sector.
One billion is gone through.
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of centres of research that can jointly benefit from specialist infrastructure and exchange useful information and data.
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
in writing. - Mr President, I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office because the situation in third countries, especially in Africa and the Middle East is deteriorating all the time.
Mr Severin rightly pointed out strategic reciprocity: that Europe needs a strong United States and the US needs a strong Europe.
Therefore, I would like to ask whether the Council can tell us what percentage of the refugee stream can be covered by the resettlement programme.
I firmly believe that, in the near future, the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to waive visas.
Finally, they did not discover a food inspector or an EU food safety agency, but an enterprise itself.
Belarus (debate)
For this reason, we should use our vision of military capabilities to focus on soft power and prevention in order to advance the new programme that has already existed before, but which has clearly emerged in Munich, because President Obama's policy allows us to open a new era of disarmament negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to be able to present this evening a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which the Committee on Budgets prepared some time ago.
In September, the MDr Messrs did not vote for Mr Barroso as President of the Commission because his profile did not indicate the legitimacy of his re-election.
Through the restructuring of our agricultural policy, we can ensure that the main emphasis is placed on the proper welfare of animals, that they live in conditions suitable for their species, and that they are healthy and strong, thereby acting in accordance with the principle that prevention is better than treatment.
We are now concerned that if the scope of this directive is extended, the directive will suffer the same fate as it was in the latest attempt to adopt'made in' origin marking, in other words, will once again be blocked by the Council.
(SL) Mr President, I would like to add my voice to the proposal made by my fellow Members that small and medium-sized enterprises, at the heart of the action taken by the politicians of the Member States and the European Union to revive the economy.
Countries such as the United States and the United States, with both deficits of more than 10%, will have to make substantial adjustments to restore financial stability.
We should separate these issues, otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on a new media law in Hungary, which is not his responsibility.
It is clear that there is not freedom of expression in China either.
- Report: Jean-Marie Cavada
In addition to the police for wine-growers who conduct quality policies, in particular in Provence, it would be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product of mixing finished products and allow misleading reference to its rosé.
But there is still a lot of work to be done.
This will result in job losses in Europe's rural areas and in less food production capacity.
Let us also remember that, apart from the institutional issues, this period of the Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is, of course, a sign of the need for progress on climate change, progress on the financial crisis and the concern for a Europe that needs a policy conducive to job creation, many important issues need to be addressed.
However, I would like to emphasise: we are well aware that a number of necessary texts for police and judicial cooperation need a new legal basis which will enable Parliament to play its role as colegislator.
I would also like to welcome the decision of the rapporteurs to exclude from the drafting of an ethical element that is naturally in the hands of the Member States.
This is a good thing, because young people will decide the future of the Union, but on the other hand, we should bear in mind those who have made a fundamental contribution to building Europe.
In other words, we are dealing with an economic recovery plan in which we allocate three and a half billion to energy oligarchies and not a single euro for the partners whose assistance we need to achieve the same support for the transition to green energy.
Fishing quotas and resource management are essential in preventing the phenomenon of total overfishing of inland waterways and oceans.
We would prefer to see Parliament's resources increased by means of groups and measures to increase efficiency rather than by increasing the total budget.
This package can also prove that the European institutions can cooperate responsibly, efficiently and constructively in such an important area.
I believe that the approach, based on initial actions recommended by the Commission in its proposal for a recast of the directive, in other words, improving first-instance procedures, will allow us to apply genuine economies of scale in the medium term.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have produced a good report and we have succeeded in reaching a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading.
We do not want to put European jobs in countries where environmental requirements are not at the same level as we do.
Everyone has made a valuable contribution.
(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating.
In order to reach an agreement between the 27 Member States, it is very important to show the unity of Europe and its willingness to overcome the crisis and to preserve the heart of European integration.
Madam President, as Vice-Chair of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights, I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report.
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the sectors of the economy in which tourism has the greatest potential for development.
At that time, the funds were earmarked for only two types of projects aimed at reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions, namely carbon capture and storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea.
If there were a request for money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for redundant workers in the UK, we would be voting in favour of their admission; another attitude would be with criticism.
As far as the Court is concerned, we know that this institution functions fully, although it is still in its infancy.
It concerns our neighbours, both those close to Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, and those further Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
I, together with my colleagues from the Commission, am very committed to gender mainstreaming in all the policies that we will be presenting.
These projects will help to bridge the gap in interconnections within the European Union and enable further optimum exploitation of internal energy sources in the European Union.
Moreover, this is a politically based approach and, in my opinion, it now needs more than everything in Europe - it is also a task for our Parliament.
There is also the point that FIFA has not introduced a technology into a shortage line applied to other sports discipline.
After all, we have the possibility of organising various types of training or workshops, where we can actually help reach EU funds for the activation and development of rural areas.
There are also Members who use the lack of such a policy as an excuse to justify concluding bilateral agreements with suppliers, who often ignore the requirements for transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity.
Furthermore, I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in ensuring a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming.
In particular, many Member States have made significant efforts to fulfil their obligations under the pact.
The ultimate aim is to enable the EU to find solutions to the major social problems affecting all Member States, which they cannot face (ageing population, health, energy supply, water and food supply, sustainable development, combating climate change, etc.), as well as developing knowledge to boost innovation and the competitiveness of European companies.
Although we will support this resolution tomorrow, I think that there are certain inconsistencies in this budget and I would like to point out two of the main ones.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Csibi, for his excellent work.
We will move forward on issues relating to the governance of the global economy, in particular, on financial regulation and on the smooth implementation of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.
However, I would like to go into more detail on this issue.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade and to facilitate their reintegration into the labour market.
The key issue is the lack of Europeans' willingness to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment, which would naturally result from accession.
This is an ingrateful and difficult role.
This is our top priority.
However, the EU's support is crucial to ensuring the country's independence.
The Israeli Government continues its forced colonial operation after war crimes were committed at the beginning of this year.
According to the evaluations and additional expert visits, Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area.
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has five tactics at its disposal.
an increase in the budget in these areas and the creation of a new military capacity, which will contribute to a resumption of the arms race;
I would also like to highlight the contradiction in the commitments made by the Pakistani Government to ensure freedom of religion and its leading role in organising Islamic countries to support the Pakistani Agenda'Combating Defamation of Religion' in the UN.
I am talking about this afternoon, because that is what I think.
In my opinion, the compromise reached by the Council is a good one because it guarantees both equality of rights and equality of treatment.
In this situation, rapid, coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions in the form of the introduction of programmes for returning old cars in exchange for significantly reducing the price of the new car, financial assistance and so on is absolutely necessary.
In my opinion, the proposed legal basis is the right one, but it does not seem to love with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the importance of which is more than important when the functions and rights currently shared between the two pillars will be consolidated.
Madam President,'success or failure' is the question'.
Such a policy is doomed to failure if those working in the fishing industry, from fishermen to the traders selling fish, do not observe the rules.
This costly, useless and principled debate is being held by a parliament that is an ideal illustration of democracy based on accountability, and it is a monstrous deception towards our constituents.
This is a shame, because it would seem that we should be united in this matter.
We no longer say that liberalising trade and combating climate change will result in the elimination of 100% of our industries in Europe, while in a way, it is indifferent, because the most important issue is the climate issue.
The debt burden of which we are seeing today is blocking the path to economic growth, not only for European countries, but also for the United States.
Furthermore, this report will help clarify the various air agreements and facilitate the processing of these agreements; it also lays down criteria that we should draw attention to and aspects that we should follow up on.
I will vote in favour of the telecoms package, but I do so with some reluctance, as I believe that there has been a fundamental betrayal of the basic principles of the liberalisation of telecommunications, which this directive was intended to achieve.
(PT) Mr President, President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are currently tackling the incredible severity of the crisis.
Their impact will be greater and the costs for the taxpayer if we are able to coordinate our efforts.
The European Commission is preparing directives to facilitate the acquisition of EU visas by Belarusians and a readmission agreement.
Let me give you a particular example.
Let us look at, for example, the issue of childcare.
We also do not yet know whether the standards that we are promoting in terms of legal trade in timber will become binding and functioning globally - some speakers have already highlighted this issue.
in writing. - (PT) The creation of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis as an authority to analyse and assess the coordination of the measures taken by the Member States to promote sustainable development in terms of quality of development is essential.
in writing. - I voted to amend the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow more effective vaccines to be used and reduce the bureaucratic burden on farmers.
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for strong, integrated EU policies to be established.
By abstaining, I would like to express my deep disappointment at the outcome of the conference, which is far from what our citizens expect.
Untime payments often lead to distortions both in the internal market and in cross-border trade.
Of course, we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility, on budgetary rigour, none of which questions, but we cannot ask the citizens to bear the entire burden, because they are our only chance of emerging from the winning crisis.
There is an early warning system in the United States.
One of these cases concerns my constituents, Andrew Symeou.
We must jointly defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy.
Speess action: this is what the Europeans expected when choosing this parliamentary term, and we must do it if we want to see an even greater number of Europeans going to the polls in the next five years.
The European Council discussed and agreed parts of the text that fall under its remit.
Large consumer spending has risen by more than 80% over the last decade.
I think that at the moment, it would be useful to engage in effective reflection on the right methods of enforcing the existing legislation.
The results of the summit in this regard are very vague.
To this end, the proposal proposes the introduction of a single implementing title to be able to execute or safeguard measures, in order to avoid problems linked to the recognition and translation of instruments issued in another Member State and the standard formula for notification of documents relating to creditworthiness in the territory of another Member State.
I support the proposals for the 2011 budget because it includes important policy areas and individual opinions.
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes enabling cooperation at European level.
For example, the Council's decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 enabled the Member States to cooperate at national level, at an intergovernmental level, in order to prosecute these crimes, which, thankfully, has even entered into the legislation in some Member States.
Thank you.
My vote should also not be seen as support for a'easy source of EU money'.
We are buying ever more often, and the Internet is now influencing a complete change in our habits, partly because our lives are accelerating.
As far as information is concerned, we are handing it as we receive it.
Finally, I would like to say that the best investment is investment in the education of the young generation, which is ongoing education.
We would like the death penalty to be abolished throughout the world.
I very much welcome the fact that these issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council.
(Applause from the centre left)
In this case, it is about thousands of people who often travel with small children and who do not have adequate funds.
The procedures are completely different if the Commission is asked to the Commission on the basis of the provisions of a possible future Treaty, and when it asks Parliament through the petition procedure.
Human rights must be respected by all sides of the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, the debt crisis in Greece has cast doubt on our ability to maintain stability in the euro area.
We must all feel responsible.
In any case, we understand that UNESCO has appealed to the Chinese authorities on the impact of rebuilding on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar.
in writing. - Mr Schwab has presented a report which aims to increase car safety by introducing stricter safety requirements for producers.
I therefore voted against this report.
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard, but we have shown that we are capable of taking action and have strengthened our resistance.
If, for example, we are talking about the position of Parliament in relation to external institutions, even if human rights organisations that may have an impact on them, if we do not reach an agreement, but I hope that this will not happen and if individual projects cannot be implemented, I think that Parliament's position will be met with support and understanding.
The southern Thursday sittings in this Parliament are taking on an increasingly surreal turnover, both because of the empty benchmarks we have observed and on the topics that are being handled and dealt with.
I still do not believe that it is clear whether Moldova will be able to appoint its President, and if that does not happen, there will certainly be new elections in the country in the coming year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Economic and Monetary Union began to operate on 1 January 1999, when eleven EU Member States adopted the single currency at the same time.
(EL) Madam President, I, too, should like to support and welcome the present compromise, as it shows the collapse of democracy that women have been subjected to for many years, mainly by helping self-employed women, in trade, in the craftspeople, in small and medium-sized enterprises and in the liberal professions, without any recognition of their work.
Of course, our political elections are very different and often contradict.
I would call it climate justice because it is about relations between developing countries and developed countries and about wanting to present a credible proposal on financing mitigation and adaptation measures and on how we intend to take leadership.
I would therefore like to know the Commission's position on this matter.
I would remind everyone of the state aid granted to banks that have benefited from this aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach.
As well as having three children, I also have grandchildren who now write nothing other than milk.
We are ready to draw up technical assistance programmes, which will be accompanied by harsh austerity measures to be taken by the Greek authorities, thereby showing that Europe is committed.
We are looking forward to the Commission presenting this strategy.
As you said, we need to keep our statistical data and Eurostat straight away.
Sometimes, I wonder whether we have certainly learned enough from the consequences of our courses of action when we find European solutions for European problems and try to find concrete solutions, although we have to tackle the problem together.
The correspondence also shows that sceptical scientists against hypothesis have been excluded from the review process in order to avoid public opinion being revealed in research.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate.
The Internet has perhaps threw light on the social problem that we are still trying to deal with, but we are unable to do so.
We know what kind of people we are dealing with here, so the institutions must be aware - in the context of inspections - that these people represent increased risks and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections.
Our priority during the review of the RoHS Directive was to improve safety standards in electrical appliances and e-mails sold in the European Union.
Especially at school, as this social group is the most vulnerable of drug addiction.
It has achieved a successful enlargement, reuniting the continent at the end of the Cold War, but now it is being called upon to protect what has been achieved so far and to continue integration into the returns of better times.
Many Members today want answers to and respect the questions that have been asked, and I would like to hold this debate with formal procedures.
However, those of us who participated in this were aware that there was no other solution and that the dairy problems need to be resolved, and I hope that we are on the right track to solve some of the problems that some of the industry have encountered.
Secondly, although the ECR Group fully supports the need for the regulation on maternity and fatherhood, we have decided to abstain from voting on such references in this report because we oppose family policies at EU level; this is a matter for national governments and should make the right decisions.
Finally, I think that the next talks on this subject must be about EUBAM Rafah: how to revitalise this mission and how it can be prolonged.
So the Commission is monitoring the situation and, if necessary, will take action, but in my opinion, we should not go beyond the structures set out in Community law, and the Commission will certainly do so within this right.
As we all wish for a real EU diplomatic service, which will not only extend the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States, the Financial Regulation and Regulations of Workers, the documents that we will be discussing today and on which we will vote tomorrow, are of paramount importance to us.
in writing. - Given the persistent differences between men and women in the employment rate, salaries and access to management positions, I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC and, at the same time, to ensure that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislation.
I abstained from voting on the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission.
I really want the Commissioner to say that no further progress will be made, either at the moment or in the next few weeks, if these refugees are not handed over.
We will soon address this issue in the discussion on the revision of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport.
The European Parliament today adopted, on Wednesday 20 October, the report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis.
There is already talk of a rapid increase in taxes, in order to keep public finances liquidity.
Today, the time has come for us to insist loudly on freedom for Christians, for religions guilty of religion in the practice of practising their religion.
In the European Union, 31.5% of women work part-time (30 or less per week), with only 8.3% for men.
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commissioner and the Minister, and I think there is little clarification, but there is still a lot of cloud there.
Then there are few of us who can agree what the scale of the forthcoming economic crisis will be.
Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction, showing that it is on the side of consumers.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report.
These policies have become a key element of the economic recovery package, bringing added value and supporting efforts to modernise and sustainable economic growth, thereby expressing European solidarity.
Unfortunately, it is still the case that we do not know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon will be adopted, and we must definitely implement it without further hesitation.
However, I feel that this situation illustrates the tragic state of the agricultural sector, particularly in my region, as farmers are being forced to queue for a few days under the gold winter to try and get modest EU subsidies.
The Member States of southern Europe have been claiming too long with this.
This must be done through smart, sustainable and integrated development, in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy.
On behalf of our citizens, we will express our will in a democratic vote, so tomorrow, a very important day.
It has to be said that the provision of housing is an absolute necessity for everyone, especially in the modern care state.
I believe that the definition of political priorities means that they should be studied in detail, should be transparent and should be democratic.
This particular draft concerns the introduction of a traffic management system.
(HU) In recent months in Vojvodina in northern Serbia, a new fear has occurred in many Hungarians living there, in particular.
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise, sometimes a difficult compromise, and I understand that Alain Lamassoure and other rapporteurs have achieved on our behalf what is real and what is possible.
in writing. - We agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for equal treatment of Parliament and the Council in respect of participation in meetings and access to information, regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament on the citizens' initiative, on impact assessment and on the application of'soft law' (rather than repressive rights), but we do not agree again with the emphasis on establishing binding deadlines or on the use of EU officials.
You are aware that broadcasting is not possible without access to the radio spectrum and, in accordance with EU policy, non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum should be guaranteed to all participants.
This will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for action by the Commission to move forward in the area of gender equality in the areas that my fellow Member has just referred to, from employment to other ways, which must be ensured and guaranteed such equality.
We expect other important political and economic partners to also present their offers, which several of them have not yet done.
Dementia, and especially Alzheimer's disease, is not only a serious medical problem, but also an extremely serious problem of ethical and social importance, the importance of which is growing all the time as an ageing European population is.
I would also like to say that you have pointed out with great care that we should not confuse different responsibilities and, of course, I do not want to confuse the obligations of the Member States with those that are the responsibility of the European Union.
rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all, let me start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs who have had to deal with the details of this matter: Mr Szájer, Mr Duff, Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl.
We have learned our hand and, with the full support of all the European institutions, ask Minsk not to reject them, because Belarus and its citizens have much to win.
We need to follow developments closely, because you said that we would have savings of EUR 38 billion from European companies.
Now that Liu Xiaobo was convicted, we have seen that even the police banned homosexual events, which clearly threatens to bring about a political ice era in China for dissidents, human rights defenders and homosexuals.
(SL) Commissioner, your report on the current situation in Ukraine was clear.
We must recognise that this will only be possible if the parliaments are involved, as the majority of regulations can only be adopted through them, and that this process and the proposals relating to the transatlantic legislative dialogue and the transatlantic assembly are paramount.
Someone mentioned the helicopters.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to meet you and listen to you.
This is an issue that I wanted to emphasise in this agreement.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is sending a strong message today to women who are helping their spouses in self-employment.
Anyone who visited Gaza after the conflict can testify to the huge suffering of the population.
(ES) Madam President, relations with the United States are strategically the most important relationship that the European Union maintains.
I must say that our objective is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council.
However, we all know that Europe cannot do more better with less money.
At the same time, such a large number of participants in the Copenhagen meeting give me hope that the actions of such a large number of allies will ultimately have a chance of success.
Mr President, I would like to support the motion for a resolution because what Mr Schulz said is very important to me: if we really want this debate to cover'Europe' and not just Italy, there is no point voting on the resolution entitled'Freedom of Information in Italy'.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Parliament's recommendation is to approve and not delay the Council Regulation more, as the new regulation will simplify administrative procedures and guarantee the equal treatment of legal residents from third countries in the area of social security.
This is a shocking figure, which I have already mentioned in the report that I prepared during the last parliamentary term.
But the Arctic policy is probably not as strange as the appointment of Baroness Ashton, or Sary Palin from the former student left, to the dignity of the High Representative.
One of these is the signing of a free trade agreement with South Korea, which is, let us be clear, the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union and must remain a model for our future bilateral trade agreements.
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party's amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I am convinced that we need to reduce the budget and that the position of the party is a weak starting point for further negotiations.
I believe that, with regard to the automotive industry, too little importance has been attached to the creation of completely new types of car driven by water, bacteria or fuel links.
Then, each of us will be on our way.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union.
As a partner of Thailand, the European Union is ready to support this country as soon as possible in this complex process.
Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and prosperity, is of real benefit to the local community and does not harm European canning and canning industries, provides for an impact assessment to be carried out as soon as possible and enable it to be suspended if necessary.
The Commission and the Council are now doing this in a very laudable way to ensure that gas supplies are resumed as soon as possible, and the threat of legal sanctions is, of course, not very effective.
It is essential that the Member States immediately examine the extreme human rights abuses against Roma women, punish the perpetrators and ensure the identification of all victims and provide them with compensation.
(LT) Mr President, this is indeed a rather complicated issue.
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national control bodies, but also, as has not been said, to the importance of cooperation with the national parliaments, in particular with the European Union's committees, budget committees or budgetary control.
I would suggest to you that now that, when the European External Action Service establishes its own rules on access to information and to documents, you make it a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens and does not treat foreign policy in such a way as if it is the home of only certain secret diplomats.
All countries are currently changing economic policy in order to get out of the negative situation as soon as possible and to achieve even a minor increase.
I would also like to mention the Japanese people.
Mr Barroso answered to me that this is an internal matter.
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened, but that it should be maintained and strengthened.
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity are precisely due to the tradition of Christianity.
This is good for large corporations, but it erodes public transport and exacerbates the state of the network and security.
On the other hand, one cannot talk unilaterally about Turkey's future membership of the EU.
We need effective and, as the tragic events in Japan remind us, urgent management of this risk.
The main objective of the agreement is to provide greater protection for workers against the risk of injury caused by any sharp or harsh end medicine.
In short, I may finish my report this evening, but the work is far from complete, both for me and for the European institutions.
First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho on his excellent work and to emphasise that my group has been rather cautious about the adoption of SIS II from the outset, given the consequences of data protection.
It is necessary to ensure appropriate conditions.
In 2009, the Ombudsman recorded 3 098 complaints registered compared to 3 406 registered in 2008.
The European Court of Justice has also clearly rejected, in its judgment of October, the compulsory retirement age due to the achievement of the retirement age.
EGNOS and GNSS also have visible potential for meeting safety and environmental targets and for freer road transport flows through their ability to use tolls.
In the case of cohesion policy, which comprises almost one third of the budget, we are still facing a situation where this is the only budget area with an estimated error level of over 5%.
