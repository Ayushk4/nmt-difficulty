You can just throw your feet into it.
Developing countries rightly claim that they are not the ones who caused this crisis.

Rejs yourself and fight for democracy once.
Apart from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general warning that appoint Spanish cucumbers as culprits could be sent as well as evidence.

As President of the Commission, I would like to add my voice to the principles set out in the resolution that you have just adopted.
We must now send out a clear signal of responsibility to those who are key to the future of this crucial Treaty for the European Union, for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans we represent.
Everyone are the examples of the benefits of animal testing.
Documents received: see Minutes

It is, of course, true that the EPAs are different from the Lomé and Cotonou conventions which, for 30 years, represented the Union's relations with ACP countries, but other developing countries have been able to call into question the unilateral preferences that characterise these conventions at the World Trade Organisation level.
Although we fully support the integration of the Roma people into the European Union, we do, however, have doubts about the European Union's interference in issues which we consider to fall within the territory of individual nation states, such as access to healthcare, education, employment and housing.

However, we must fulfil our commitments on climate change, because everyone recognises that we are the leaders of the world in this matter.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, you caught me for a while, because I had not seen the whole change of scale for today, but I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Parliament on a very important subject concerning the financial sector, that is to say, the insurance and reinsurance of what we have done with the Solvency Ireport, and how we have now finally presented it to Parliament to establish a very important basis for the whole of the European Union.
It is therefore crucial that we go up to 30% and I will finish by echoing Barack Obama's words, which is that we can hand over the jobs of the future to our competitors, or we can take advantage of the opportunity that they have already begun to do.

Given the necessary guarantees, such as the possibility for European citizens to submit an administrative complaint and equal treatment to US citizens, and in view of the provisions relating to the period to which the information may be retained, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is, in this case, a proper response to the negative consequences of globalisation.
The EIB can and must play a significant role in managing the recent events in the Mediterranean region.

The Greek Communist Party is against the amendments aimed at adapting Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and therefore voted against the report.

The Serbian authorities must do everything they can to ensure that the rule of law and democracy are properly put in place in the country and they must ensure that the level of corruption is continuously falling in Serbia and that those who abuse their position are severely punished.
In short, the Europe that we are fighting for, a Europe of equal and social prosperity, economic and social cohesion, of cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights, and a Europe that promotes peace, does not have a lot of chance to arise in line with the guidelines proposed by this Commission.
For the sake of democracy and legitimacy, it is important to communicate to our citizens what the European Union is doing.
We Germans will be unfair to our national unity if we do not see it as a contribution to Europe's unity after the historical events I have outlined here.

In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained.
Furthermore, the fact that the register must be regarded as mandatory for all lobbyists who want permanent access to Parliament and to the Commission is an important step forward in efforts to achieve greater transparency in relations between the EU institutions.

It is a very important step which allows more effective enforcement of the fundamental rights of EU citizens.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to vote on the Kirilov report in the next few weeks, and I am pleased that this is urgent.

I propose an investigation into the consolidated accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general remark and then to ask two or three questions depending on how much time I get.

This debate is far too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon for this excellent report, which is timely and timely to strengthen the relationship between the two continents.
That is why we have provided for a comprehensive simplification of EU law.
Unfortunately, important amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected and, as a result, initiatives cannot be signed by residents of the European Union, who are not nationals of a Member State, which prevents their participation on an equal footing, regardless of their nationality, and there is no guarantee that signatures will correspond to those of the signatory number.
I call for the creation of an independent commission composed of local and international legal experts to carry out investigations and prosecutions in connection with the violence following the pitfalls of the pitfalls elections in December 2007.
The credibility of NATO and what we call the West's will also depend to a great extent on the results of Afghanistan.
You have gone far too far and you have to stop this.
The preparation of a multi-level guidance for public and private actors and an educational and mobility plan on how multi-level governance policies are to be implemented can be effective measures for improving regional policy.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the ongoing negotiations on a new EU-Vietnam partnership and cooperation agreement must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties.
Without influencing the adoption of important measures proposed in this report, I would like to draw attention here to an important aspect of this problem.
However, this method will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price volatility.
It will not have any detrimental impact on torrential stocks, as there is currently a very low catching of cod.
The proposed sanctions are proportionate and necessary, and they will hopefully work demoly for the inappropriate trade methods used by various parties in commercial transactions.

First of all, the rapporteur regrets that citizens do not know the rights that it wanted to give them.
However, for all of us, it is important that this collection of resources, particularly human resources, but also technical resources to combat organised crime and all forms of illegal trade, is checked with the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, because that is at the heart of our powers, namely the rights and freedom of European citizens.
It is therefore essential to adopt all measures to strengthen the guarantee that impact assessments are transparent and independent, since this will help maximise the role of this instrument in decision making and guarantee the quality and adequacy of the activities of the European institutions.
My second comment is that the strategy must strengthen internal cohesion within the European Union, the European Union's convergence, in other words.
I might add that this was not the direction taken by the Commission when its proposal - through the regulation adopted by Parliament - focused on the reform of the current system of agencies, which is private, and on the very strict consolidation of transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest, reliability of conflicts in their rating agencies.
The Commission is also called on to assess costs and benefits by creating a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Even before the crisis we are experiencing, the EU Member States have already faced social problems due to weak economic growth, a complex demographic situation and the difficulties of living in an increasingly globalised world economy.

- Report: Patrão Neves
I would like to address two issues in more detail which were raised several times in this debate.
First of all, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for Parliament's cooperation and for the willingness to compromise that allowed us to reach an agreement within the Conciliation Committee for the benefit of the European Union's bus and coach passengers, especially for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
One reason why this is our fragmented defence equipment.
Already at the beginning of this period, the question of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy were an important point.

With its very strong voice, the people of Ireland have given us the desire and the strength to continue to make progress and to build a strong and, above all, federal Europe.
While protecting the environment and preserving public health go hand in hand, I believe that we need to balance the needs of consumers and producers.
This is a way that we must resolve together.
We must work together with the large consumer countries, such as the United States, China, Russia and Japan, to address this problem and to create a global alert system and a register of illegal logging and of countries which are causing concern through Interpol, an appropriate UN body using the latest satellite technology.
However, we must not, of course, allow short-term support for the industry to undermine competitiveness in the long term.
I would like to say that this report is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Due to the effects of the current economic and social crisis, the fight against unemployment and social exclusion has attracted particular attention from the European public and the European institutions.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.

We deplore the large number of softerest voters in the European elections and the'no' votes in referendums.
We need to find out what is wrong and, when I know, you are told.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal agreements cover a very wide range of regulations, and they are not covered by the provisions of the law, whether intended or inadvertent, it may be a stumbling block for competition.
We also need a common European asylum system that is more effective and more protective.
That concludes Question Time.
I also know that you are all interested in becoming involved in a form of police cooperation that respects human rights and takes into account the European Union's values.
Picasso returned the very same horror to its paint Guernica, showing our Guernica regularly to the land of Junkers-aircraft under the Convention seven decades ago.
In this sense, speculators are also trying to speculate in a bad economic situation, which sometimes exacerbates it.

Not only must we promote competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution, thus ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on amending the Staff Regulations in the context of the establishment of the European External Action Service, the EEAS, is a very important document on the road to creating a European Union foreign policy.
Therefore, we believe - and will be discussing this again at first reading - that the initial expenditure reflects it for us on the right priorities, and we agree with the rapporteur's emphasis on the issue of multilingualism and buildings, which is issues that we have always prioritised very much, but with particular emphasis on the legislation.
Mr President, a few weeks ago, I had the honour of chairing a delegation from Parliament's Committee on International Trade attending the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva.

Firstly, it is essential to maintain geographical fragmentation in terms of financial assistance from the EU budget to Mediterranean countries and Eastern European countries, in accordance with the provisions of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, and to continue to provide support for these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.
Kosovo, in our opinion, is a one-off case and we would like to point out that Spain and four other Member States have not recognised it.
This is reason enough not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to join the EU Summit in response to the appeals of the opposition in Belarus.
It is very important to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, including when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I would like to add my voice to what the other Members have said about the rights of disabled travellers, what Mrs Kadenbach said about children, the question of fire security in hotels and, in particular, the question of spraying security in all hotels in the European Union, and the demand that the new proposal be prepared for the future.
Mr President, President of the Commission, I, too, would have liked to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission, so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment.
It is clear from the report that defence and national security are the sole competence of the Member States, which we believe to be important.

I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Lehne, for his approach to this subject.
In other words, the Copenhagen Agreement contains references to the level of ambition needed to tackle climate change in the climate change agreement after 2012, that provides the basis for a financial package and calls for serious commitments with regard to emissions reductions.
Around four million people die every year from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
More seriously from a trade point of view, I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) cannot be used to block the sale of medicines that can be found at more competitive prices - safe, generic medicines that do not violate anyone's copyright and whose only crime is that they are made by developing countries like India and Brazil, and that they may have to penetrate themselves in Western pharmaceutical companies.
After all, all Members have the right to be heard.
This is unacceptable.
We want to be involved in this.
Therefore, we must find the right level of financial and technical compensation.

I would like to refer to an opinion by Commissioner Rehn, whom I am very high, and who said that Nigeria is a very poor country, but it is not true, Nigeria is a very rich country, but it is relaxed with a corrupt and outrageous classes that have plunged its resources while millions of citizens are living in poverty.
Finally, I would like to say to Mr Mölzer that he should not be so pessimist.
I therefore call on the Council to express without delay its position on Parliament's new proposals so that the ACP countries can benefit from the measures indicated for 2010, and I ask the Commission to ensure that social and environmental requirements are respected among producers and exporters outside the ACP.
This requires the Commission - as the coordinator for the Energy Community - to address Ukraine and to remind it of its obligations when it comes to the security of Europe.
in writing. - We are, of course, suffering the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes, whether the atrocities have taken place in Europe or, for example, in former European colonies.
The main aim of the regulation must be the implementation of a new common control culture and responsibility rather than the introduction of a bureaucratic and costly process for controlling each product.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the EU's current competition policy in relation to vertical agreements is very much supportive of Internet sales, and I am sure you are familiar with that.

The financial situation of some countries in the euro area which have been under discussion today clearly shows the risks associated with moving away from the agreements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I therefore think it would be appropriate to consider how best to use the unused financial resources to broaden the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and probably necessary financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.
The Commission, and also us in this House, has deliberately decided not to raise the issue of the treatment of funds, because we are working on the assumption that the industry will keep its promise and deal with this issue itself, without legislative pressure.
This brings me to the two questions about the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, as far as the manufacturing industry is concerned, I should like to remind Parliament that Pakistan is the world's fourth largest cotton producer and accounts for 9% of the world's total production, followed by the European Union by barely 5.5%.

I am aware that there are significant differences between the electoral rules in the various Member States at present.
Many practising doctors apparently begin treatment with dementia too late in order not to exceed their budget, and that is contractual.
Paradoxically, this tool could easily be misused in practice and not only by extremists, but also by very strong interest groups, and I say so because we believe that a threshold of a million signatures is not a sufficiently high threshold when compared with the demographic potential of the European Union.
The 2010 budget takes such a systematic approach.
According to the report of the UN working group, the victims of trafficking in human beings from various social environments - and spread is going from the most affluent to the poorest, from the best trained to total illiterary, from quite young to older women.

We need more and better European economic governance to support this line through national measures, including the tax on financial transactions, which I urge the Commission to look very carefully at, including in the European context.
I believe that the mutual recognition of prescriptions among Member States is very important, as this is not only about immediate healthcare, but also about subsequent care; however, we do have some time to clarify this detail.

Consumers can invoke a number of remedies if they purchase a product that does not meet the agreement, and they will have the right to claim compensation if the absence is not resolved.

(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union experienced growth again in the third quarter of 2009, which could lead us to believe that the worst is over.
In this context, Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of tourism aimed at increasing the effectiveness of public administration, accelerating reform of health services and the pension system, improving the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the wage negotiation system, improving the functioning of the product market and the business environment, and maintaining a stable banking and financial sector.
We believe that it is still crucial to refer to the following when signing agreements between sovereign states: respect for the sovereignty of the country and its peoples, mutual interest, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account the specific characteristics of each country, and to evaluate how each party can contribute to the agreement from an economic, social and cultural point of view.
I believe that the transition to a sustainable green economy will move forward without introducing excessive legislative measures.
Everyone seems to forget the contribution of the United States and, of course, NATO in creating peace in Europe.
In my opinion, we should reflect on this as an appropriate opportunity to deal with what Europe needs desperately: economic growth, jobs, a dynamic small business sector, more innovation, more effective public procurement - all the things on which the citizens will judge us.
I do not think it is our job to like the possible developments in these countries.
The second project concerns concessions.
Madam President, during the 2004 European Parliament election campaign, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, meeting many angry constituents outside restaurants and pubbs.
At a time of great guilt in the actions of states, the increase in EU budgets is a statement of confidence in the joint project and of strengthening supranational actions.
I know that we have a good message, so let us take it out and spread.
The report outlines how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and the procedures to be adopted.
The forecasting law creates imbalance.
When the Treaty of Lisbon finally enters into force on 1 December, British domestic policy may also be discussed outside the Chamber.

Mr President, five plus two questions about economic governance and Europe 2020 were asked.
I therefore believe that we should involve the national authorities, the Commission and the Members of this House actively in the process of raising SOLVIT.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Michel, Mr Michel, for the protagonists and a liberal rhetoric, which have led to the current situation, while promoting the interests of the large food industry and protecting the interests of the global agricultural industry, many years of insufficient investment in agriculture, with the promotion of the reduction of agricultural industry and small and medium-sized agriculture, a sector where 70% of the world's poor have their record.
Economically, because the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs, and the CAP must make it possible to resolve this problem.
I also call on the Commission, within the framework of cooperation with the government, to exert constant pressure to honour this commitment until these rights are anchored in law.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand Parliament's great interest in the measures taken in the European Union and elsewhere to respond to the challenges facing some Member States in terms of their public finances.
We sympathise with the nations that want better life, better status and a better future.
Even the Irish Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) support you.

The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the revision of the competition rules for horizontal cooperation - B7-0565/2010).
That is what you have fought for together, be you dead or orange.
In my opinion, this procedure gives EU citizens greater food security and provides greater clarity for the Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.
Against this background, it seems stubborn to pursue a Mercosur diet, especially when the Swedish Institute for Food and Technologies pointed out that the Brazilian beef carbon footprint could be up to 35 times higher than the Irish beef sector.
4, in the original regulation, which is Article 1 (b) of the amendment Regulation:'The same reference rates are used annually to change the value of the charges affected by Article 4a, 4b and Article 6a (3) if these charges are specified in different currencies to euro'.
Now they are coming to terms with the solidarity of the European Union, and rightly so.
Look at Ireland, a country that was particularly hard hit by the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union protected it against a crisis of even greater proportions.
He fears the German requirements on properties in Sudeten and, listening to German politicians' opinions on this matter, I think that he has good reason to worry.
increased support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as increased financial support for technical activities relating to project development and implementation,
If we do not implement something that will cause countries to realise that this will have harsh consequences if they conduct an unreasonable economic policy, we cannot move forward.
We must improve and promote more activities aimed at tackling climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As always in these complex cases, I have enjoyed excellent cooperation with my own group of shadow rapporteurs - Bernaen Vergnaud, Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle.
Mr President, in Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is indeed a major problem.
Similarly, it is up to each Member State to decide whether to sign or ratify the framework convention for the protection of national minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two main instruments of the Council of Europe.
It is therefore a structured dialogue that allows us to exchange views on matters that are of concern to us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, that is, where people who are already in work, are given protection and some support now to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then, through the process of retraining and upskilling in a year's time or two in order to have a new job; to keep existing jobs in place.
Our questions have been shaped in highlighting the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and what we can offer in such a package.
I voted in favour of this report because it also greatly improves the Commission's text, particularly in relation to data protection for individual citizens.
In addition, we have carried out a review of unused funds from 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion can be mobilised for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for energy.
Thank you very much for your proposals and very clear messages.
We can also see an attempt in a holistic approach that has not been entirely successful in the way we imagine, but which is nonetheless a step in the right direction.
Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which sometimes went a little bit hard, and the Council, where we tried to find reasonable solutions for the night crops and for trialogues, and just one hour ago, they also approved our fair compromise.
In order to ensure a holistic and coordinated effort, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, set up a crisis coordination group for European aviation ('European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell') after the Council meeting of the EU Transport Ministers on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that, in the context of illegal logging, rarely the problem itself is the basis for the trade in illegal timber.
I come from a country, Portugal, and a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and rooted in regions that are socially rather fragile and where it would actually be vital to maintain the quota system after 2015.

In some cases, in fact, they are so good that they should be considered.
(SV) Mr President, Iceland is a small nation in terms of population, with some 300 000 people, but it is a great nation.
Mr President, honourable Members have an important role to play in monitoring health claims.
It is therefore a clear'yes' from us to Nabucco, but it is equally clear that our decision to support the efforts of our governments to ensure that diversification of supply benefits our populations.
Political parties can be banned, there is corruption in the justice system, there are violations of human rights, freedom of expression and freedom of association do not exist in the same way as in countries like Britain and most other European states.
It is also quite obvious that we need an energy mix involving different energy sources, with as broad a basis as possible, because it will stabilise the energy situation and, as a result, the diversity of each nation and also the European Union will be given their right.
However, I have doubts when Parliament claims international law when it comes to condemning certain fraudless practices when the legal basis for this is far from clear.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia because I want to express clearly my full support for the Tunisian people and the democratic revolution that they have launched, which will have a historic impact.

If you push through a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decrease that from now on, it can only be changed by a two-thirds majority, you know that it will not be easy to change it again after the next elections.
General tariff preferences (debate)
Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
As far as a new sense of mutual trust is concerned, another significant problem arises.
This year, we have allocated a further EUR 9..5 million to the EEAS, but it will be possible to assess the real costs after the first operational year, when Parliament will be presented with a report on all the costs involved in the work of the EEAS.
My question concerns Pakistan, whose chronic lack of stability, as we know, is a crippling factor for the whole region, including for Afghanistan.
But, of course, we must not forget the natural biological differences between men and women.
We must not forget these factors, even when the agreement falls to the proposal to earmark income from infrastructure charges.
(HU) Mr President, what I welcome in this directive is a clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution to the problem of there being no professionals available in one's own country.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to make a few immediate comments on the issues that have just been raised.
Last week in committee, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a Presidency for ghost.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran, as I am concerned about the repeated violations of human rights there, particularly with regard to freedom of association, speech and information, and because I support the Iranian people's aspirations for democracy.
In particular, fast-start financing will be very important.
It is one thing to create such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens in order to enable them to make full use of it.
The agreement will not only make Canadian and European markets more competitive, it will also make them safer, but will increase the cooperation of regular and enforcement authorities on all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement in order to ensure the highest possible level of safety for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know if Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
Furthermore, at a more personal level, tourism provides a better picture of Europe and it promotes European citizenship.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating today aims to amend the regulations approved in 2004, which improved and harmonised safety regulations relating to the protection of EU citizens' passports and travel documents against counterfeiting and, at the same time, introduced elements relating to biometric identification.
Secondly, some kind of institutional framework for the implementation mechanism must be drawn up for decisions.
Having said that, it is positive that some of the agreements we have recently concluded are really good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
It is therefore important that Parliament once again reminds the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade understands that the current constructive cooperation with the EU is much more effective than trying to write history all the time.
It is grotesque that, to date, the Commission has neither found the necessary arguments nor the time necessary for the Latvian Government to put an end to this discrimination on the grounds of language.
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link all forms of support to the Pakistani Government to the immediate elimination of this harmful discrimination against its religious minorities.
This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
It is acceptable and legitimate, and we have fought for it.
There is clearly more need than ever for financial institutions to stop and look at their methods once.
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we have achieved this in committee.
The main objective of trade-related aid is to boost the national and international competitiveness of the 48 states.
Even if you accept the idea of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is, in the end, untenable only to penalise heavy goods vehicles and not ordinary cars with the aim of alleviating traffic congestion and, furthermore, to apply the old'polluter pays' principle clearly discriminatory.
I welcome the understanding and support expressed in this debate.
In addition, we have a number of concerns when we look at the starting point.
The most important thing for the European Union and national governments, both the left and the right, is to safeguard the continued profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working class throughout the European Union.
Attention should therefore be paid to disseminating good practices and making local decision makers more aware of the benefits of ICT.
Mr President, we could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speaker.
However, there is a very important aspect of this new version, this codification, which concerns the whole restructuring of the TEN-T networks over the next decade.
(LT) The European Parliament compromise resolution on Ukraine is important for the people of Ukraine, but we must not forget that it is also very important for the European Union's population, because Ukraine is one of our important partners, especially for the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
That is why the Commission must have a strong voice.
We cannot interfere with a matter for which the US Government alone is competent.
The people who manage our forests get poor or no payment to deliver these hidden functions that many people take for granted.
Unfortunately, we must also say that the list of unresolved problems is any longer, rather than shorter.
As regards Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I ask that both the Council and the Commission, both now represented by Mrs Ashton, take urgent action against three problems.
There are large dealers who are in a robust position in the market in some of the Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are more satisfied with what we are proposing now than with what has been going on since 2002, because they have seen that some conditions that were not charged with the legislator in 2002 have not been in their interests, but rather have made it difficult for them to cope with clear competition from the large dealers.
The European Union must establish the regional policy partnership for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa launched by the Committee on Development when its report was adopted in April 2007.
These years, especially following the historical enlargement in 2004, the context and objectives of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) changed considerably.

on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to expressly support Mr Böge's report.
The Commission's draft was amended in line with the report we are voting on following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading.
These are the people who suffer most, and they should not be ruled out because of the place where they live.
All medical assistance, regardless of its specific characteristics, falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to warn Parliament that a recent study carried out by the European cardiological company has once again shown that this method has a serious restriction as a result of the low level of participation of women in such attempts.
It is not about using investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but nor should they prevent these social and environmental objectives from being achieved.
I call for greater attention to be paid to the recovery of organic waste, especially in this region, which is predominantly marked by agriculture, to the monitoring of data and to a system for exchanging best practices.
There is a completely incomprehensible law that Orthodox priests, bishops and patriarts should be Turkish citizens.
As one of the most important points in the report, it draws attention to the proliferation of measures which have been taken and which, precisely due to the lack of coordination, is not coherent, either in terms of legislation or of implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has secured the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least, the issue of the digital internal market has experienced a breakthrough in the European Union's priorities.

(DE) Mr President, I support the motion by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss it.
Is this economic development model which Europe should propose to Europeans?
As a rule, I am not leaving the speakers exceeding the speaking time set, but I think we can all agree that the opinion of Mrs Tzavela was particularly important.
We want a real strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment which, once implemented, will in the end improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region.
It is indeed a great achievement, because without touching on the question of the legal basis, this directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and it opens up a range of new opportunities for them to be better treated.
Year on year after year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to convince us that the EU budget has been legally and properly implemented, and I was really concerned about the lack of control over taxpayers' money when I was Chief Peter of the Commission in 2002.
It is a huge challenge and a great honour for me.
If we are to be honest, we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and recognise that our emissions per capita are still many times higher than in China or India, for example.
I am sure that the dialogue that will follow will be constructive.
We therefore deplore the fact that the desire for a high speed, as with Europol, has gained from the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposals, which aim to introduce a simpler method for allocating funds from the European Social Fund so that the fund can contribute more quickly and effectively to resolving the economic and social problems that Europe is facing.
I would have frankly voted against the proposed composition of the Commission, but among the weak candidates, there were also very good candidates, including the Polish, Janusz Lewandowski.
You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but, beyond Britain, there are actually 26 other Member States in the European Union as well, so you must understand that, although we are very sensitive to the concerns you have expressed, I must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I believe that on this point, we must be careful and stick to the European Union's humanitarian action being neutral, even if it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
It also adds new points to what Parliament has already said: it calls on, for example, on the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to assess the results of the investigations carried out by all parties and to report back to Parliament on these assessments, emphasises that the EU and the Member States' accountability and credibility require these investigations to be fully monitored, express its concern over the pressure being exerted on non-governmental organisations and the follow-up and the Goldstone report.
I also hope that this resolution will help to save fish species that are disappearing.
I hope you see my questions as help with thought, not as a provocation.
I am always willing and, I hope, able to come back to you to account for our results, but we have to check what we find ourselves.

When Europe speaks with one voice, it will also take this objective on board.
Therefore, I personally support the prices agreed for European tobacco producers for at least for as long as people continue to smoke in Europe.
Looking at the efforts of the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries are taking the problem more seriously than others.
I would therefore like the European Social Fund (ESF) to be autonomous and separate from European structural policy.
The number of new infections continues to exceed the expansion of treatment, and two thirds of those who needed treatment will not receive treatment in 2009, which means that 10 million people with such a need for care did not have access to the necessary effective treatment.
When the dignity of a person is appreciated, we see no minority as anything negative.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify this fund.
All the European institutions should, in future, ensure that our budgets are targeted at helping citizens and businesses overcome economic difficult economic times and planning the recovery.
The fastest way to get them to get the whole, which is much more effective and practical than all the actions from above, is to support citizens' initiatives and the activities of cultural and regional institutions.
To all those who are today fighting this Treaty in the erroneous belief that it is a treaty that strengthens the European Union, I would like to say this: those who are fighting this treaty actually strengthens our so-called partners, or whether you like, our opponents.
The EU's embrace of global capitalism is an embrace which will stifle us all.
We will soon be holding a TEN-T meeting in which the Commission will push for the development of a network involving other means of transport.

The first person to ask for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community.

In fact, I would like to remind the House that, according to the last count, more and more than 20 million unemployed people are unemployed in the European Union - and this figure is probably 25 million now - meaning that attracting even more asylum seekers is actually a kind of collective suicide.
It is the Commission that must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
The economic recovery of Sri Lanka is dependent on foreign direct investment and financial support from the EU.

I have had particular interest in the issue of children's rights in relations with abroad.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has been trying for 10 years now to equip itself with legislative instruments to combat economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for demolishing national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products within the European Union, and continuing to build a single market in this sector.
If we really want to respect the objectives that we have set out in our foreign policy in the treaties, I believe that we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants who have staying illegally in the European Union back to Libya.
I therefore endorsed the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships under the'Innovation Union' flagship initiative, and I think we should all be actively involved in promoting innovation, because innovation, as I said, is very important for the future.
We have a newly elected government in the UK, which has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 on specific measures in agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand in hand in hand in order to achieve a positive result both for the environment and for employment.
There are some countries that do not use all the ESF funds that are allocated to them, leaving about 30 or 40% unspent.
This actually leads me to wonder, even though the Commission has said that it has come up with the information and publishes them and that there is a duty to publish them, which is why it was unfamiliar with this, for example.
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal for an effective information campaign to be launched to make points of single contact visible.
It seems rather odd that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to fight the economic crisis and to make the implementation of the economic policy objectives mandatory.

I would like to assure the European Parliament that we will continue to address these issues - including at the highest level - and to remind the People's Republic of China of its international commitments in the area of human rights.
I hope and I believe that your votes will form the basis for an agreement.
First of all, it is regrettable that the Commissioner's colleague, Charlie McCreevy, is not here - the race to the harbour must have started!
They may not be aware of this, but there must be extensive animal testing, for example, to check such allegations.
Something that makes me a bit suspect is that of a great impact on the CARS 21-group and its impact on the process that is being speeded up here.

The planned EU aid for the years 2007-2010 to support the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova amounts to more than EUR 50 billion.
Of course, we cannot understand how an illegal worker takes up work and the person who employs him and covers his residence costs and other costs is ultimately punished.
I believe that this measuring system, which is based on the promotion of various investigative parameters, will give political decisions that are more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to stress that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on and linked directly to the abolition of restrictions on freedoms and an end to reprisals against participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists.
Finally, Lady Ashton, you need to go to the Middle East.
Worse still, the US Congress asserted itself by adopting a US law for the protection of Americans in service only a month after the establishment of the International Criminal Court in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain briefly that I would like to you very briefly that this report contains the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in continuing the resolution adopted in plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission's proposal, which intended to approve the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption even after it was subjected to anti-microphone treatment.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my own deep sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concerns about the four other Cuban prisoners and one of the opposition activist who has also opened a hunger strike in protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 for an area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should be not to waste as much as one cent.
The European Union, in particular, the countries along the Mediterranean, has always been at the forefront of providing humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity towards people living under such problematic conditions is fundamental.

(Laughter and applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the two Commissioners and the Commission for their opinions today.
Although a number of amendments have attempted to improve Mrs Guillaume's report, it provides a real incentive for people who want to misuse this procedure and overburden the relevant services at the expense of those who really need to carry out their cases quickly.
Now it is our turn to and our responsibility to do everything we can, and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work, which benefits us all.

The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, in relation to what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of each proposal, I should like to ask whether an investigation can be carried out into the issue in question, including on the basis of the Euromed cooperation and the specific characteristics of this area, so that criteria which each country must take into account right from the outset and comply with their planning.
We must also look at the issue of Roma women, who suffer from specific poverty problems, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and the problem of young Roma, because their lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to find employment in these times of economic crisis.
I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which aims to extend the scope of its interventions in the housing sector in order to help marginalised communities in all Member States.
It is also a reminder to all politicians in their spheres of competence that real freedom of the press also requires a great deal of effort from public authorities; there must be a will to protect freedom of expression and promote development.
In my opinion, the European Union has become far too large, it has far too many cultures, and I simply do not trust the system, and the whole thing is getting worse still.
It is a little too early to announce the results of this analysis, and the honourable Member will be aware that each step in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to stress that the prospect of European integration is the biggest incentive for the Balkans to carry out the necessary reforms, and it is also a factor in regional stability.
Now that advertising plays an even greater role, it is essential that we lay down criteria allowing consumers and patients to be fully informed and absolutely sure what side effects these medicinal products can have.
By circumventing the words of Neil Armstrongh, it would be a small step for EU funds, but a huge step towards the European economy.
Thirdly, as has been repeatedly claimed, the security shortcomings that exist if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not vote in favour of it.
The rapid spread of the Internet and electronic commerce in recent years have led to an increase in online gambling and have meant that problems have arisen across borders, and these problems have not yet been resolved.
All decision makers in this area and asylum seekers should be given equal access to professional information about the country of origin of the applicant and the competent bodies to deal with complaints.
So I can look to you after all these years, which is an important step in setting up the only multinational, directly elected parliament in the world.
In fact, the sum of EUR 30 billion has been defence per year, and this EUR 200 billion must be spent more appropriately than in the past.
Together, we have made a difference.
In this legislation, we must also work on services of general interest.

There is a massive need here for reforms in Turkey.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, so it is important now to provide assistance to Lithuania.
