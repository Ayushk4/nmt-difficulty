Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

Mr President , the G20 summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report discussed on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight the fact that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a far greater impact on the environment than domestic production , subject to stricter rules for reducing carbon dioxide emissions , which is mitigating climate change .
It is hard to accept that the countries allocated to these funds cannot use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
Maritime institutions in the Member States must work much more closely together to harmonise their training programmes , as well as to enable paid work experience experience experience and exchanges between European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the impact of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we note is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened and the European Union must also force the authorities of the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities .
I would like to add one thing , which no one has pointed out with the exception of Commissioner Almunia has yet pointed out .
The areas which are sensitive to climate change are mainly the following : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , and , last but not least , people &apos;s health .
I would also like to express my personal and Commission sorrow over the deaths of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendarm at the terrorist attacks last week .
Congratulations , Mr Piebalgs , to all you do .
However , it is to be welcomed that the Committee on Budgets , in view of the resistance and concerns expressed by the Committee on Culture and Education regarding the downgrading of education policies , in particular , at a time when unemployment is rising and creating problems in a number of Member States of the European Union , tabled the necessary amendments which I supported and raised the initially designated appropriations ( for example , in the case of Article 1502 of the lifelong learning programmes ) .
Next came a minority government of a totally different political conviction of power , but no one regarded it as a coup .
Indeed , the fact that , while the issue of Abyei remains unresolved in the referendum is very irresponsible and written down on how a war can start again in the future .
The example of the Romanian over-the-board player Marian Cozma , who was cruelly murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows once again that crime is not being allowed to be put off borders and that this results in the opposite result if the problems of this society are ignored .
We need a sensible European food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to bring together Member States &apos; resources in order to achieve the best possible results , and in terms of working on common strategies and operations , which will also make Europe into the political union in which the founding fathers dreamed many years ago .
That is the request we have made .
We are all in favour of the internal market , as Hungary has also been from the outset .
The inevitable climate change forces society and the European Union to take account of a new reality .
Electric countries must continue to promote internal stability and help to find both social economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It has been a glorious three-year dishonesty and , as with most short-term apprentices , it is also nice when they finish .
The need for NATO to maintain awareness and support , especially in Afghanistan at the moment , is central .
Something needs to happen - we need to get things off the ground .
In this respect , common aspects must be taken up , such as reduced VAT rates , exemptions from the scheme , the possibility of setting a maximum rate and , last but not least , the tax place for supplies within the European Union .
Let me say a word about the West Midlands : we have the highest youth unemployment and our car industry outright partly due to the EU &apos;s funding for jobs in Slovakia , which removed important jobs from the Ryton plant .
It is important to ensure that these tenacious institutions are not scared to weaken or undermine key provisions relating to financial sector reform .
That is all about .
We should also promote the creation of a network of research centres capable of sharing specialist infrastructures and of exchanging useful information and data .
Qimonda fulfils the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
in writing . - I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office since the situation in third countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , is getting worse .
Adrian Severin rightly observed the strategic reciprocity in which Europe needs a strong US and the US needs a strong Europe .
I therefore ask : can the Council tell you what this flow of refugees will mean for what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme ?
I am convinced that the Canadian authorities will soon make every effort to abolish visa requirements .
Ultimately , it was not a food inspector or an EU food safety authority that discovered it , it was the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
We should therefore put our positions on military capabilities , with the emphasis on soft power and prevention , through which we have to tackle the new agenda , an agenda that already existed , but which became apparent in Munich , because the policies of President Obama allow us to start a new era of disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me this evening to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been clear in the Committee on Budgets for some time now .
In September , the members of the MoDem-party did not vote for the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , as his results did not allow us to recommend his re-election .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that the focus is on good animal welfare , that animals live under conditions that are suitable for their species , and that animals are strong and robust in accordance with the principle that prevention is better than cure .
We now fear that , if its scope is extended , the directive will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , that it will once again be blocked by the Council .
( SL ) I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians , Member States and the European Union give small and medium-sized enterprises a key place in making economic recovery .
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States , both struggling with deficits of over 10 % , must make strong adjustments in order to restore sustainability to their public finances .
We should separate things , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to speak about the new media law in Hungary , and I do not think that his responsibility is .
Clearly , there is no freedom of speech in China either .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Besides insulting wine-growers who pursue a quality policy , particularly in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product that is the result of a mixture of finished products and to allow misleading references to ros√© waters .
However , much more needs to be done .
What will happen is that jobs are being lost in rural areas throughout Europe and that our food production capacity will decrease .
Let us also remember that , in spite of these institutional issues , of course - and this whole autumn - the Swedish Presidency is seriously affected by the need to tackle climate change and the financial crisis and the concern in Europe that we need a job creation policy - a lot of important issues to address .
However , I would like to stress that we all know that a number of the texts needed for police and judicial cooperation need a new basis , thereby enabling Parliament to perform its role as colegislator .
I would also like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs for excluding the ethical element , which is naturally within the powers of the Member States .
That is good because , after all , it is young people who will be drawing up the future of Europe , but we must also remember those who have already made their own very important contribution to Europe &apos;s construction .
In other words , we are formulating an economic recovery plan in which we are giving EUR 3.5 billion to the oligarchy of energy giants and not a single euro to those partners who can help us secure the transition to green energy .
Fishing quotas and the management of stocks are essential if we are to prevent the total overfishing of inland waterways and seas .
We would have liked Parliament &apos;s funds to be increased by redistribution and efficiency , so that the overall budget was not increased .
In addition , this package will be able to show that the European institutions are able to work responsibly , effectively and constructively together in such an important area .
I believe that a front-loading approach , as advocated by the Commission in its recast proposal , which improves first-instance procedures , will allow us to achieve real economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a sound report and we have managed to reach a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products in first reading .
We do not want outsource European jobs to countries that do not impose the same high environmental requirements as we do here .
All contributions were beneficial .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly getting worse .
The Presidency must work hard to achieve mutual understanding among 27 Member States , reflect Europe &apos;s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and maintain the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as the Vice-President of Parliament for democracy and human rights and would like to thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , the funds were only envisaged for two projects aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere , that is , carbon capture and storage , and windmills of the North Sea .
If it were proposed to mobilise the EGF in order to provide support for redundant workers in Britain , we would vote in favour of the allocation of aid , and we would be criticised if we did not .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the ICC is fully operational , but is still in order .
It concerns our neighbours and covers our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as countries , further away , such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I am keen , together with my colleagues in the Commission , to have the gender dimension included in all the policies that we are presenting .
These projects will help eliminate differences in interconnections between systems within the European Union and will enable the best use to be made of the European Union &apos;s own energy sources .
It is also a political approach and I think that , above all , Europe needs more political action , and that is certainly also a matter for Parliament to be responsible .
There is also the question of FIFA &apos;s failure to introduce target technology once other sports have done so .
After all , we have the opportunity to organise different forms of teaching or courses where we can guide how to access EU funds earmarked for rural development .
There are others who take advantage of the lack of such a policy as an excuse for their bilateral agreements with suppliers , which often ignore the demands for transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
In addition , I welcome the fact that we have also managed to achieve closer cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
Many of the Member States have made a great effort to fulfil their obligations in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact .
The intention is to enable the European Union to meet the major social challenges facing all Member States , which cannot cope alone ( ageing population and health , energy , water and food supplies , sustainable development , climate change and so on ) , and to develop the knowledge required for our businesses to innovate more and increase its competitiveness .
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow , I think there are some inconsistencies in the budget and I would like to highlight what I consider to be two of the most important .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will make progress on the governance of the global economy , particularly in terms of financial regulation and timely follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to explore this issue a little more closely .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 in order to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market .
The problem behind it is that Europeans no longer want to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment , which would necessarily be the result of accession .
It is an ungrateful and difficult role .
This is our absolute highest priority .
The European Union &apos;s support is vital in ensuring its independence .
The Israeli Government is continuing its colonissions with force , and this despite the fact that it committed war crimes at the start of this year .
The review and follow-up visits of the expert groups have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has the five longliners it had before .
The increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military institutions , which will contribute to a new arms race .
I would also like to point out the contradiction in the Pakistani Government &apos;s commitment to religious freedom , on the one hand , and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries , in support of the resolution on combating defamation of religion , on the other hand , on the UN , on the other .
I think that is quite honest .
I believe that the Council has reached a good compromise , because it ensures both equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , it is essential to introduce , for example , programmes for the surrender of old cars in a coordinated manner , for example , a consistent reduction in the purchase price for new cars , financial assistance and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is correct , but it seems to be rather inconsistent with the more than remarkable entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , when the functions and powers that are now shared on the two pillars are being combined .
Madam President , &apos; Succes or failure &apos; .
The fisheries policy is doomed to failure if the parties involved , from fishermen right to those who sell fish to consumers , do not comply .
This costly ineffective shopping of a parliament under the guise of an artificial groundwork of responsible democracy , a massive deception of the constituents who elected us .
This is unfortunate , as we should agree on this matter .
We are no longer saying that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100 % of our businesses in Europe , where we are , in a sense , indifferent because the climate issue is the most important .
The debt burden - which we must acknowledge with pain - stands in the way of economic growth not only here in Europe , but also in the United States .
In addition , the report will help clarify the various air agreements and deal with them in the simplest possible way , and it outlines the criteria which will need to be made aware of and which aspects we need to monitor .
I will vote in favour of the Telecoms Package , but I do so with a certain amount of scepticism , because I believe that at the highest level , the basic principle for the liberalisation of telecommunications has been betrayed , which the directive was intended to implement .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing a crisis without precedent .
They will have more impact and lower costs for taxpayers if we can coordinate our efforts .
The Commission is in the process of preparing a directive to facilitate Belarusians &apos; access to EU visas and a readmission agreement .
I would like to highlight a concrete example .
Let us look , for example , at educating children and schools .
We also do not yet know whether the standards for the legal trade in timber that we are advocating will be implemented and applied globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this problem .
Reducing a special committee on the economic crisis to analyse and evaluate the coordination of the actions taken by the Member States in support of sustainable quality growth is essential .
I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and of reducing red tape for farmers .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of this report as it sends an appeal to set out strong , integrated EU policies .
By abstaining , I would like to express my deepest disappointment at the results of the summit , which were well below the expectations of our fellow citizens .
Late payments often cause difficulties in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and restraint , no one is contradicting that , but we should not insist that citizens do all efforts , since they are our only chance to emerge from the crisis .
In the United States , they have an early warning system for this purpose .
One such case is a Member of my own constituency , Andrew Symeou .
We must stand united in defending our rights , freedom and democracy .
This is what the Europeans asked for during the European elections , and this is what we should give them if we want to have more electoral turnout in five years &apos; time .
The parts of the text in which the European Council is competent were discussed and adopted by this Council .
Private expenditure per capita consumption increased by more than 80 % in the last decade .
At this point , I believe that it would be useful to give effective consideration to how to enforce existing legislation in the best way .
The summit conclusions are very vague in this regard .
To this end , it is proposed to introduce uniform instruments , which would establish the right to exclusions or legal retention measures in order to avoid problems with the recognition and translation of instruments from other Member States , and a standard form of notification of documents concerning claims on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because the important policy areas and individual positions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes to work together at European level .
For example , the Council Decision of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 gave Member States the capacity , for example , to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level to pursue such crimes , which unfortunately - and we all remember the case with General Pinochet - is even provided for in some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should also not be perceived as supporting the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy &apos; approach .
Our procurement is increasingly distant procurement , and the Internet has now completely changed our habits , partly because our lives have become increasingly hectares .
As far as information is concerned , we constantly communicate the information as we receive them .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in the education of the young generation , and I am thinking about lifelong learning .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I welcome the fact that these issues have been resolved satisfactorily in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the middle and left )
In this case , thousands of people , often with small children and without sufficient means , are affected .
Procedures are completely different in terms of submitting an angle to the Commission according to the provisions of any future treaty , and when it comes to submitting a complaint to Parliament through the petitions process .
Human rights must be respected by all sides of the Middle East conflict .
The debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain stability in the euro area .
We all have to face up to our responsibilities .
We can understand that UNESCO has , in any case , approached the Chinese authorities regarding the impact of work on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - Mr Schwab has produced a report aimed at increasing road safety by imposing increased requirements on car manufacturers for security .
I therefore voted against this recommendation .
The economic and financial crisis hit us hard , but we have shown that we can act and we have strengthened our opposition .
If we discuss Parliament &apos;s position with external bodies , such as human rights organisations , which can be affected by this , and if we do not reach agreement , then I hope that there is not the case and if individual projects cannot be implemented , then there will be support for and understanding of Parliament &apos;s position .
These plenary sessions on Thursday afternoon are increasingly peculiar in this House , both in terms of the lack of content that we see and in terms of the issues that are raised and of the way in which they are dealt with .
In my opinion , it is still completely unclear whether Moldova will be able to elect a president and , if this does not happen , it will , of course , have to have to have to go through a new election next year .
in writing . - ( FI ) The European Economic and Monetary Union was set up on 1 January 1999 and 11 EU Member States introduced the single currency at the same time .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to welcome and welcome the present compromise , as it highlights the democratic shortcomings that have been suffered by particular women for many years in helping their self-employed spouses in trade , crafts , small and medium-sized enterprises and in the liberal professions without any recognition of their work .
Our political choices are , of course , clearly different and sometimes conflict .
I would call it climate justice because it is about relations between developing countries and developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for financing both mitigating and adaptation measures , as well as the way in which we also show our will to lead .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission thinks on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks , which enjoyed good support , but did not adopt a similar social approach .
I have not only three children , but I also have a grandchild who is currently drying nothing more than milk .
We are ready to put together technical aid programmes to accompany the tough austerity measures that the Greek authorities must implement .
We are waiting for the Commission to present it .
As you say , we must regularly update our statistics and Eurostat is investigating this .
I sometimes wonder whether we do not understand enough to learn from the consequences of our actions if we do not find European solutions to European problems and if we do not try to find specific solutions , even if we have to do it collectively .
These e-mails also show that scientists who are sceptical about the hypothesis have been kept outside the professional evaluation processes in order to avoid any flaws in research from public knowledge .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
The Internet has perhaps thrown light on this very dark side of society , with which we are still trying to reconcile itself and cannot be associated very well .
We do not know who we are dealing with here and therefore , as far as inspections are concerned , the institutions must be aware that they pose a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections .
During work on the amendment to the RoHS Directive , our main priority was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic devices sold in the European Union .
Preventive work is carried out , mainly in schools , as this social group is most vulnerable to drug addiction .
It successfully and successfully expanded the whole continent at the end of the Cold War , and now we need to maintain the results achieved so far and continue to integrate once again , when times come better .
There are many Members who want to answer their questions this evening and , in the interests of them , we will be implementing this properly and in a proper manner .
However , those of us who helped to do so knew that there was no alternative for the dairy problems to be resolved , and hopefully we are now beginning to resolve some of the problems that the sector is contending with .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity leave provisions , we have chosen to abstain on such references in this report because we oppose family policy being dictated at EU level ; it is up to national governments to decide on this .
Last but not least , I believe that in the next negotiations on this subject , we should discuss the issue of the European Union BAM Rafah ; how can we revive this mission and how can it be extended ?
So the Commission is monitoring the situation and , if needed , action will be taken by the Commission , but I do not believe that we should go beyond the structures existing in EU law and the Commission will definitely be within EU law .
As our common vision is to have a real European diplomatic service that will not only extend diplomatic services in the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we will be debating today and voting on tomorrow , are of paramount importance .
in writing . - In view of the still existing abyss between men and women in relation to employment , salaries and access to senior posts , I would like to call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC and , at the same time , to ensure that the provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national law .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want you to say , Commissioner , that no further progress is being made now , in the next few weeks , unless the people who are on the run are extradited .
We will deal with the matter as soon as possible in the context of discussions on relaunching the first railway package and the White Paper on European Transport Policy up to 2010 .
The European Parliament has today , Wednesday 20 October , adopted the report of the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
You are already talking about higher taxes in the near future so that public finances can keep their heads above water .
Now is the time for us to demand loudly that Christians and supporters of other religions can freely practise their religion .
In the European Union , 31.5 % of women work part-time ( 30 hours or less per week ) are compared to only 8.3 % of male workers .
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commissioner and the Minister , and feel it is slipping through the loots , but there are still many clouds .
At that time , we were unable to know anything about the scale of the economic crisis that was ahead of us .
Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction and shows that we are on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs R√ºhle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
This policy has become an important element of the economic recovery package , contributing value and supporting modernisation and sustainable economic growth , demonstrating European solidarity at the same time .
It is also unfortunate that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , and we definitely need an entry into force without further stays .
Nevertheless , I believe that this situation clearly shows what a sense of mind and a burden on agriculture are , and this is certainly the case in my region , if such that is the case , that farmers have to queue up on a daily basis in the winter months in order to secure modest amounts in EU aid .
South-East European countries have waited for far too long .
This must be done through the implementation of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will be making our voice heard in a democratic vote , and that is why it is an important day tomorrow .
It must be said that access to a resident is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in the modern welfare state .
In my opinion , setting priorities which are political methods means investigating their transparency and being democratic .
This specific project concerns the introduction of the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , there has again been a climate of fear among the many nationalities living in Vojvodina in northern Serbia , mainly Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and other rapporteurs on our behalf have achieved a result that is practicable and possible .
We agree with the parts of the proposal that ensure equal treatment for Parliament and the Council in terms of access to meetings and information , regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament , cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives , impact assessments of legislation and the use of &apos; soft &apos; law ( instead of penal code ) , but we do not agree with tightening and strengthening the mandatory limits for the implementation of directives and the use of EU &apos;s civil servants and civil servants ?
Everyone knows that there can be no television spread without access to spectrum resources , and it is EU policy to ensure that all actors in the market have non-discriminatory access to spectrum .
It will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for the Commission &apos;s efforts to make progress in the areas of gender equality , which my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to other ways of ensuring and guaranteeing this equality .
We look forward to other political and economic heavyweights also being put their offers on the table , which , for several of them , has not been the case so far .
Dementia , and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular , are not only serious medical problems , but also an extremely sensitive ethical and social problem , which will be increasingly serious in the context of the ageing of the European population .
I would also like to say that Mrs Gebhardt was very committed to pointing out that we must not interfere with the various responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to mix the responsibilities of the Member States with the responsibility of the European Union either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs who have gone into the detail on this subject , namely Mr Lamassoure .
We have taken them our hand and , with the full support of all the EU institutions , take against it , Minsk , because you and the Belarusian people have a lot to gain .
We need to monitor carefully what is happening , because the President said that we would have annual savings of EUR 38 billion for European businesses .
With the ruling of Liu Xiaobo , the police have banned a homosexual party , which is clearly threatening to lead to a political ice time in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Madam President , Commissioner , your statement today on Ukraine was very clear .
We must acknowledge here that this can only be done if the legislative assemblies are involved , because it is only through legislative assemblies that most of the legislation can be adapted , and that this process and the proposals for the transatlantic dialogue between the legislator and the transatlantic assembly are of crucial importance .
One of the speeches was raised with helicopters .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - ( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , I was delighted to see you here and to hear your speech .
That is what I would like to highlight in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to women who help their spouses in their self-employment .
Everyone in Gaza after the conflict can witness the enormous suffering of the population .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States are strategically the most important relationship of the European Union .
I must stress that it is our ambition to achieve political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , the large number of participants at the Copenhagen Summit are filling me with the hope that the efforts of so many allies will ultimately have a chance of success .
If we really want this debate to include the whole of Europe , not just Italy , there is no point in voting on a resolution called &apos; freedom of information &apos; in Italy .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
In this European Parliament recommendation , we propose that we adopt Council regulation and do not delay the process any further , because this new regulation will simplify the management of procedures and ensure the equal treatment of third-country nationals legally resident in the European Union in the area of social security .
This is a shocking figure and it is a figure that I mentioned in a report that I drew up during the last parliamentary term .
However , a European policy on the Arctic may not be as strange as the appointment of the extremely unqualified Baroness Ashton , Sarah Palin of the former student left of High Representative .
One of these is the free trade agreement with South Korea , which was signed on 6 October , and which is simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union ; it must be a model for future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the ECR Group amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 level , as I firmly believe that this is a reduction that is needed , and their stand represents a guiding starting point for negotiations .
I think that , in the context of the car industry , we have placed far too little emphasis on the development of completely new types of cars , plug-powered cars , battery hungry and mergers .
Then we go each way .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a Thailand &apos;s partner , the EU stands ready to support the country as far as possible in this complex process .
Indeed , in order to ensure that this exemption , which should allow for the creation of jobs and prosperity , is of real benefit to the local population , and does not harm the EU processing and canning industries , it was essential to draw up an impact assessment as quickly as possible and , if necessary , to allow for it to be suspended .
That is what the Commission and the Council are doing right now in a very commendable way to ensure that gas supplies are restored as soon as possible ; threatening legal steps is , of course , not a particularly effective approach .
It is urgent that Member States urgently investigate the extreme violations of human rights against Roma women , punish the perpetrators of violence and ensure that all victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) This is indeed a very complex issue .
I would like to point out the importance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies , but also - and this has not been mentioned - the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and , in particular , with EU committees , budget committees and budget surveillance .
I suggest that , now that the European External Action Service is in the process of laying down its rules on access to information and access to documents , this service is being made available to a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens and that does not treat foreign policy , as though it were just a secret diplomatic service .
All countries are currently changing their economic policies in order to get out of the unfavourable economic situation as soon as possible and ensure some sort of economic growth .
And I would like to tell you something about the Japanese people as well .
In response to this , Mr Barroso said that this was an internal matter .
We therefore belong to those who believe that it should not be weakened , but rather preserved and strengthened .
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity can be brought straight back to the Christian tradition .
It may be useful for large companies , but it distorts public transport and is responsible for the deterioration of the network and safety .
On the other hand , the discussion about Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot simply be left to one side .
This risk must be tackled effectively and promptly , as the tragic events in Japan show .
The main objective of the agreement is to increase the protection of employees against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or leading objects used in healthcare .
In short , I may conclude this report this afternoon , but the work is far from finished , not for me , not for the European institutions .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and I would like to stress that my group - from the very outset - was rather hot about accepting SIS II , thanks to many implications for data protection .
There must be orderly conditions .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman received a total of 3 098 complaints against 3 406 in 2008 , which represents a 9 % decrease .
The European Court of Justice has also clearly rejected forced retirement on account of retirement age in its October judgment .
EGNOS and GNSS also have significant potential in the area of application of safety and the environment and in the area of air traffic in road transport , as they can be used for levying duties .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for nearly a third of the budget , the situation is still the only budget area in which the estimated error rate is over 5 .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report which has been supported by the majority of Members .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of the proposed way out of the crisis and into a green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , is to make the new , profitable sectors a very good business and not to protect the environment and meet the needs of the general public .
I therefore share the concern that you have expressed for the Hungarian Presidency that such important objectives may be distorted by national debates , rather than by the promotion of what unites us .
I agree with the conditional payment of expenditure on the basis of prior authorisation in justified and clearly defined cases , when cross-border healthcare includes at least one night in hospital , requiring highly specialised and expensive medical equipment , or when there is a specific risk for the patient or the population in general .
The most important thing we could have done and can still do to lead is to aim for a stricter emission reduction target of at least 30 % .
Missing is particularly damaging to those actors who are making real efforts to alleviate environmental degradation .
Of course , earlier scandals show how the relaxation of an approach some Member States has to the issuing of visas .
The poor population of rural areas , which is most in need of financial assistance , is being abandoned again .
I know that you are able to meet the challenges .
President of the Czech Republic , I warmly welcome you to Parliament .
Mr Orb√°n did not present himself to Parliament &apos;s groups as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as an &apos; fighter &apos; which is estimated populist and nationalist tones and &apos; protects the Hungarian people &apos; from &apos; attack &apos; .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I therefore welcome the report and would like to congratulate Mr Sz√°jer on it .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to convince Iran not to build nuclear bombs .
I totally oppose the idea of preventative bomb attacks and anti-NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the prerequisites for Europe &apos;s stability .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo , with his report , has done a very important job , allowing us to create a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
In view of this , we are committed to creating the conditions for genuinely sustainable fishing that can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic are difficult , but there is also no doubt that the area , as a result of new technologies and progress , will inevitably be opened to an increased use of its natural resources , in which fishing is a good example .
Youth unemployment reached 20 % at the start of this year , as a result of the economic crisis , and the school dropout rate reached 17 % ; young people in rural areas are particularly badly affected .
Today , the market is marked by a wide range of ecolabels , images and texts that can be confused to consumers - from the images of forests on heroes with dangerous substances to allegations of neutral carbon footprint and even organic cars .
We voted against the motion because it involved putting the responsibility on behalf of the underdeveloped third world &apos;s problems on European countries rather than on the countries themselves .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking all the time and delaying the lunch , but I am only doing that for every 10 years , so perhaps it is not doing anything .
It is a difficult job here , a job to change things for the better , and she is simply not enough .
Only last year , we agreed to repeal these rules , and our producers have noticed and still note it , even though consumers have not noticed that large difference .
I do not believe that the proposals contained in this package are sufficiently ambitious , as they are only aimed at saving and reducing the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow cuts to the CAP budget because it would mean that agriculture is worth less in the European Union .
At the same time , huge direct and indirect costs are involved in early decommissioning of such a large installation , as can be seen from economic calculations .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the compromise reached .
Mr Zatler , President of the Republic of Latvia , it is a very great pleasure for all of us to be able to welcome you today , on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Next was the killing of the male .
Once an agreement has been reached with a third country that can be transit country for illegal immigration and there is a readmission agreement , which is the objective , and the EU &apos;s agreements with the third country in question are therefore strengthened , which is the global strategy and the idea of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum , this means strengthening the borders of EU Member States .
We regret that our proposal is not fully included in the report , but we welcome the fact that its conclusion is very close to ours .
Given that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an open global trade environment is one of the tasks assigned to President Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I would like to take advantage of the Commissioner &apos;s presence in this House to ask him how he sees cooperation with the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture as regards the conclusion of negotiations as part of the Doha Round .
In the report , we propose simplifying financial supervision and control , as well as strengthening technical and scientific evaluation through peer review based on excellence .
The proposals made here today must be considered , analysed and understood in this light .
It is also necessary to highlight the legal and administrative obstacles ( subjectivity , financial provisions and , in some cases , also intellectual property ) that can hold many important research actors and SMEs from participating .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will rethink Directive 2007 / 52 in accordance with the aspects it has just listed .
That is why I also voted in favour of the provisions which emphasise corporate social responsibility .
Firstly , we can see that progress on the new point that we developed together , namely the issue of openness , has been limited and that the possibility of those who enter into infringement proceedings or who request it , in order to find out why they have finished or why they have started as a result of new rules on access to documents , will in any case , be smaller .
Unfortunately , like my colleague Mr Tannock , I would like to say in this Chamber that , unfortunately , is always half-way at this point , this is not the first time we have discussed the terrible human rights situation in Burma .
The task of society , therefore , is to ensure that women and men can freely choose between the two options that each of them have a justification when they are viewed from a broader perspective than just work .
Nowadays , it promotes consumption of products with little , reduced nutritional value , leaving thousands of stockbreeders who cannot market their products in a country whose production covers 50 % of needs in the lurch .
The full impact of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our company is not yet clear .
Within the framework of the peace process in the Middle East , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is as important today as ever - and perhaps more important than ever .
Fossil fuels create a centralised , hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution .
In this respect , I agree with the views of my fellow Members .
( HU ) The Hungarian Presidency has now reached halfway , so it is worth looking at the results up to now .
I believe that the review of the first railway package must identify the problems in the Member States that have received justified opinions from the Commission and find a way of resolving them .
Israel does not realise that such an enormous military reaction feeds new , potential suicide bombs and invites new Kass rockets at the earliest opportunity .
The authorities in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the calls to release her as a large number of countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , Secretary-General for ASEAN and a number of ASEAN Member States , of which Burma has , after all , are part .
The vote will take place immediately after the ongoing debate .
I think that Mr Cuta≈ü has pointed out that the guarantees for EIB operations in the EU budget amount to almost EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , which is a large sum of money for the EU , and therefore Parliament is fully entitled to expect an explanation of the risks associated with this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but on Timo Soinis and on its own behalf , I would like to ask now : where is the information about the project that the citizens of all the Baltic States are claiming for before the construction industry ?
Were it not for the active participation of the Czech Republic , this decision would never have been taken .
I am convinced that it is essential to launch an information campaign on this issue .
In fact , since 1999 , Serbia has not been able to verify identity documents held by Kosovo .
In this area , too , action has been taken and introduced clear and precise rules .
Are Mr Corbett &apos;s vision of Europe &apos;s federally united states or a freer vision of free trade for Europe , which my party supports ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report that she is presenting today .
It is not impunity - impunity is going on for many years .
It is rare for anyone to encounter so many qualities .
I am convinced that all of you in Slovenia will accept that such stress tests are carried out immediately in Kr≈°ko .
It is not good that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit on Thursday .
We have seen a lot of work done to meet standards , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
Under circumstances such as these , it seems highly cynical to allow the Moldovan Government to force the population to fund such uncertain European Community programmes and agencies as , for example , the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky ATM Research ( SESAR ) Framework Programme , when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union .
In this way , we would kill two birds with one stone , since the expansion of infrastructure could speed up the European economy and employment and could , at the same time , mitigate the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Khanty-Mansiysk , we agreed that our common objective was to conclude a strategic agreement that will provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations for the future and contribute to developing the potential of our relations .
It is now clear that we still need a few demands when it comes to relations in the Mediterranean region and , in particular , Libya ; we need to consider things a little more to realise that we need perhaps a stronger effort to understand what has happened and also to make concerted efforts in the Mediterranean .
The EU &apos;s considerable financial contribution to this line was conditional on the local population supporting the project and on private Italian investment being involved in it .
( SK ) A week ago , the report on the accession process of the Balkans was published .
For this reason , we have also abstained from the vote on the motion by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on issues relating to TV1 in Portugal , although the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of the situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed the introduction of a country-country reporting system so that transnational companies should report back on landing axis .
One key issue raised in the report is the problem of prostitution and female trafficking .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , even with the arrest of Ratko Mladiƒá and Goran Had≈æiƒá , the Tribunal &apos;s work on dismantling will be unfinished .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the claim for compensation that has been made against those companies that are responsible to naive farmers who have wrongly poisoned their own cattle .
I support the Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve the EU &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to be able to find solutions , we need to take the same approach in future .
However , as you know , our message is very much about structural reforms : structural reforms , which increase Europe &apos;s growth potential and job creation , are essential .
This partnership , especially in the current global financial crisis , can be of crucial importance and open to greater opportunities for trade , scientific and technological exchange , which will enable us to emerge from the crisis in a more stable position .
We can no longer accept passivity .
Approval and the subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have meant that the European Parliament will have a greater responsibility with the administrative burdens that it entails .
At a time of unprecedented crisis which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort must be made to ensure that the number of unemployed or poor people in employment in the EU does not reach 25 million in 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , once again , I would like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption , on which I tabled proposals , together with four other MEPs , and which half of the European Parliament , plus one , adopted the aim of committing the Council and the Commission to legislation that is really effective in the fight against corruption .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports your programme for Parliament and Parliament &apos;s business in the next five years .
In the name of democracy , we must let them make these promises a reality !
In our opinion , it is precisely through this kind of dialogue that we will be able to help these countries , especially by involving civil society .
Although , as a socialist , I do not believe that under the conditions in Sri Lanka , guerrilla war will bring about a solution , the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against military oppression .
It is time to speak out in favour of simpler , less costly measures for SMEs which will , of course , lead to the possibility of more jobs and more growth .
In combating this phenomenon , it is very important to accept uniform security measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
When we talk about collective redress , the issue comes up with the United States and its experiences and extremes always emerge .
The immediate entry into force of the EU-US extradition and legal aid agreement will boost criminal cooperation and eliminate the grey zone that made extraordinary renditions possible .
I have three proposals for which I would like to ask for support .
The European Court of Justice has already received petitions asking for specific cases to decide several times whether or not a sports activity is a service with purely social benefit , or , on the contrary , it also contains economic aspects involving the provision of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is one of the highest priorities of this institution , and citizens must know it .
Only time will it prove whether this will be a marginal problem , or whether the unquestionably positive effects of the directive will be the prevalent .
By modernising freight transport logistics and promoting co-modality ; that is , combining different modes of transport within the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase prosperity in the Baltic Sea area .
It should be up to the Member States to decide whether they want to ratify the ILO Convention in a democratic process .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the monthly minimum income fluctuated between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the final adoption will be slightly less bad between .
The Copenhagen Summit was , in many ways , a disappointment .
We ask international donors , whether state or non-state , to cease their activities in certain areas , should the proposal be adopted .
This has diminished the legal protection of the rights of the individual and is an aspect we must discuss again .
( DE ) Mr President , thank you very much .
Today , V√°clav Havel told us that Europe is a homeland of our home countries .
Therefore , if I speak Hungarian to a police official in Slovakia , he has a duty to answer me in Slovak , even if Hungarian is his mother tongue , and whether I understand his reply .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to comment on one aspect of transatlantic police and judicial cooperation in Swift , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of Swift-bank data to the United States .
In 2009 , we witnessed an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection used , both in individual EU Member States and in emerging economies .
As far as SWIFT is concerned , transparency has not been taken seriously - either by the Commission or by the Council .
Finally , it is politically important for us to enter into an alliance with ACP countries within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
We must do something else .
If we succeed in bringing together a abandoned and orphan child and a family longing for children , we will have made a very important contribution .
Therefore , as a significant step towards making the 2020 strategy a success , I will focus , in particular , on how crucial it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing against each other and , in fact , on the instruments which are crucial for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza should also force us to look at Gaza in a more strategic and long-term context .
It is necessary to develop other indicators which will help to explain the factors affecting living conditions in a country .
According to medical experts , treatment with the right drugs can postpone the need for the person suffering from the disease to be placed in a costly care home by up to a year .
Mr Tajani , the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship , has committed himself to examining the losses in this sector .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions aimed at implementing the Council resolution of 6 April 2009 .
Tomorrow &apos;s vote is very much about the position of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union needs to strengthen its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , defend its interests and protect its citizens by establishing a common approach to the main challenges and threats , and by adjusting its capacity and its resources to respond in a satisfactory manner , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and stability in the world .
This is a good time in relations between the two parties and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This will be a step forward in efforts to achieve greater transparency in the EU institutions , and I hope that it will contribute to increasing the legitimacy of the European project in the eyes of its citizens .
I suggest that you read the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions , monitoring and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - and
However , if we want to tackle this problem successfully , we must also support such actions with robust and decisive political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I say it to you .
They should be either clearly tight or have clear benchmarks , regardless of how they have been built up ; perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it would like to put forward to some extent to meet India &apos;s requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I have really heard every possible be thrown into the head of the Italian Prime Minister , except that , thanks to his dynamic activities , he is providing jobs for tens of thousands of people .
Whether this is happening at the right time is , of course , an issue for Parliament itself to decide .
Therefore , this report serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme , while at the same time calling for change in order to change the excessive administrative and financial rules and the low level of success that still makes this programme unaffordable for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) at a time when they are playing an important role in translating the results of research into and goods , as well as better cooperation between the various European institutions , and the various stakeholders , at a time when they are still better coordinated and stronger .
However , it is the case that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis , because it has chosen side .
This does not lead to our industries competing .
He called for a global ban on so-called &apos; key body scanners &apos; .
Statistical data show that cardiovascular disease causes around 4.3 million deaths in Europe a year and more than 1.7 million people die from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective public health measure for the protection of Europeans against infectious diseases , but it is also important for populations in developing countries to have access to healthcare , thus increasing living age and combating poverty .
We must therefore say quite clearly that the use of the new rules in the euro area to increase their profits at the expense of citizens is directly stupid .
In this economic situation and in this House , we must definitely ensure that expenditure is kept under control .
I therefore believe that better protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
He has played a very important role , because he has examined all cases that have been brought before Syria &apos;s highest security court and regularly assessed prison conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
At the time , it seemed that the new Member States would each respect the fundamental principles of the European Union and ban discrimination , protection and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities in particular .
A crisis affecting the economic system , but indeed democracy .
These new measures would allow EU citizens and businesses to assert their rights , especially in terms of the recognition of qualifications and their social and residence rights .
The issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off occurrence .
In its conclusions , the Council calls on the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to perhaps preparing an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
First of all , they have the right to be fully included in the first days after the arrival of their child in the family .
These intentions deserve recognition and not criticism , even if this is not the most important thing here .
The Quality is that we in the European Union must remove our absolute dependence on Russian energy supplies .
( RO ) Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 11th biggest trading partner at present , and trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounted for 1.6 % of the European Union &apos;s total foreign trade agreement in 2010 .
I would first like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this procedure into our Rules of Procedure was Maryl√®ne Renault , not me .
Its own fisheries sector is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing four reports in today &apos;s debate and I would therefore like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the Commission for their cooperation .
With regard to the summit , I very much agree that this is an important occasion .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which - and I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s remark - will apply in a uniform and non-bureaucratic manner throughout the European Union without affecting the existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama has said that China &apos;s representatives are welcome to examine documents in the archives of the government in exile to ensure that he has not been instigated into violence .
It is its response to the problem , which has curbed its development and integration into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day , we will be presented with many demagogic demands without any professional basis , both in the media and here in Parliament .
As human rights are a key aspect of the EU-Pakistan agreement , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings as it is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of EU citizens , given that it directly affects the buildings in which citizens live and use .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable - albeit temporary - attitude to derogations from the fundamental principles of the European Union , including the four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not agree that it is acceptable for Parliament to use it as a result of demanding a larger budget .
It is high time to end this unilateral American privilege .
I would be pleased now , as this directive is in place , if Mr Dalli and the Commission would focus more attention on regulating social security , which is the system on which everything is based , and which makes it clear who is paid and where everything is well organised .
We must never lose sight of our common goals , and let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
I think there was a great need for this fund and it is a good example of Parliament &apos;s influence in budgetary preparation , providing funds which - if I may say - were not used in other areas .
Let us now look at the hypotheses .
In order for this to happen , we must do all we can to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In sectors as sensitive as apparel , readership and turbines , it is very important for companies that have decided to maintain production in Europe to preserve European knowledge and European jobs to create the necessary conditions for consumers to make a well-informed choice .
Although violence against women has been a topic for several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this incredibly destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument , reinforcing relations with third countries , with certain tangible benefits .
In addition , it is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right but also the duty to express its opinion .
With this proposal , however , we have broken down this barrier , and we have done so because we need to be careful about patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises that these important proposals are urgently needed .
I believe that all patients have a right to high quality healthcare , and healthcare provided in their own language is close to where they live and where families are close to their family .
In our debates in the European Parliament , we must use designations that have all been accepted , and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been accepted as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be done and will produce better results .
Recent developments in the European economy , not least around Greece , have shown the urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
In order not to be a lie , their donor , Stuart Wheeler , has said that it costs GBP 120 billion a year , which is approximately 36 times the real figure .
This dual approach to Belarus - &apos; stok and stick &apos; , as I believe Mr Tannock called it - will hopefully be the one that succeeds .
We could talk for hours about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation , etc . - but I think it is important that all three reports that have been presented to us today express a fundamental consensus around our efforts in recent times .
Secondly , he also said that the Commission should start looking at the possibility of Eurobonds - and this is also the time , I think .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
This is not the kind of credibility Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
According to the regulation , suppliers must apply labels and labels supplying consumers with information about fuel consumption , as well as rolling resistance , wet grip and rolling noise .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether or not it wants to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In relation to this attempt to achieve a more bold and more ambitious result , I also believe that , at the final stage of the COP 16 negotiations , the European Union must give its chief negotiator a certain degree of flexibility in responding to the development process during the negotiations .
Therefore , Balanced and transparent measures are essential , as the project can only be successful if we win the confidence of businesses .
There is the problem of the devastating impact of aid on the environment , particularly in coastal areas and on Spanish islands , but also in other areas , such as Madrid .
It is important that the special representative of Central Asia follows the situation very closely , in cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission .
This process should also include the necessary maintenance and monitoring following the closure , treatment , storage and decontamination of waste , the environmental upgrading of installations , and support for the replacement of production capacity in units released , taking special account of environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is my opinion .
I come from the country and , when I come to the supermarket , I meet a man on a scarce basis with a tree behind .
For example , there was a great deal of discussion about the sale of fertile soil in developing countries and countries that have no arable land ; all buying it is a very interesting subject to debate , and I think that this is also a subject where we can achieve a certain amount of common understanding .
However , with a clean European network , the European Union &apos;s key objectives will not be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco in 17 of the 27 Member States is being grown and public subsidies are provided in all of these .
One of the three languages - English , French or German - will be used to automatically ensure legal protection throughout the European Union .
Madam President , this is a very controversial topic in Ireland and it is water on the edge of those in favour of a &apos; no &apos; to the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency did everything in its power to reach an agreement , but in the end , it decided that the matter should be settled by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny from time to time that we have different opinions .
That is how the Commission will work .
This may be a one-off case due to the agency &apos;s relocation to the final office building .
The amendments tabled will allow less developed Member States , which includes Romania , to meet the conditions of this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all sides of this House praise the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
It is almost superfluous to emphasise the importance of both of these points in the current situation .
We will work together towards concluding the Doha Round with a positive result in 2010 , as this is very important in efforts to promote the recovery and combat protectionism .
Ladies and gentlemen , today is a somewhat special day for me , because this was - after 10 years of good and loyal service - my last session of President here in Brussels .
From an efficiency point of view , I also believe that it is an interesting proposal for these delegations to take over certain consulate tasks , such as issuing Schengen visas .
We seemed to have spent a long time discussing each other , rather than discussing one another on a daily basis , and we ended up being emphatically discarded .
The Commission &apos;s proposal must be prepared further , and Parliament must be given longer to decide .
Perhaps there are plans to go further than is planned now .
All Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation without the European Union and its protective shield .
As a social democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in the area of education and training , the reduction of poverty and increased access to safe drinking water .
This morning , the President of the Commission , Jos√© Manuel Barroso , said with the Treaty of Lisbon in its hands that it is the Commission that speaks on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
You can say your opinion , you can disagree , and even euroscepticism is allowed , but the end result must be the same .
Lukashenko , a skilful political actor , has been able to exploit its election programme , has benefited from all the political and economic benefits and , at the same time , has remained indifferent to democracy and human rights .
In return , according to the same joint declaration , the EU and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude agreements on local border traffic between Russia and the European neighbouring countries , which may be interested .
It is crucial for the welfare of European citizens in the future .
Commissioner , you yourself have talked about the flawed implementation of legislation by several Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other armed Palestinian groupings must and must recognise that people in southern Israel have the right to live without bombarments .
We must do everything we can to ensure proper recycling , not only to prevent damage to the environment and health , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I have to recall that Omar al-Bashir still has an international arrest warrant hanging over its head , as the country &apos;s authorities ignore .
In this letter , he also confirmed that the Commission intended to send a detailed report on the project &apos;s first year of its project to Parliament , and its initial work has started .
I expected you to respond to this and to call it to order .
With regard to the regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is basically a good one : it concerns banning and gradually replacing products that have had serious effects on human health .
The aim of the draft decision is to establish the fishing opportunities for EU vessels on the basis of available stocks , as well as financial contribution for access rights and sectoral aid .
We in the European Union must give the Tunisian unity government every possible help and also , in every possible way , help to EU citizens , including British citizens who have been stranded in Tunisia during their holidays in the country .
I voted in favour of the draft regulation because I believe that it is right and appropriate for the island of Taiwan to be transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , these traditional communications media themselves often fail in democratic societies because of commercial interests , or because their management belongs to a special political environment and indirectly oblige employees to practise self-censorship .
We cannot exist in the European Union as long as this situation continues , which is why we believe that it is very important for the Commission , the European Union authorities and we all make proposals in this direction in order to put a stop to this situation .
That is one thing , and I must also keep a close eye on a number of social , environmental and economic criteria , since I strongly support a prior assessment of all legal texts .
That is why I voted for the report on the 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 European Development Fund .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are talking about Belarus in this House , but talking is not enough .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to support the motion .
Secondly , I am pleased that East Jerusalem is regarded as the keystone of the future Palestinian State or the Jerusalem of the two states .
The third lesson we can learn is that the European Union must emerge .
However , there are large discrepancies , even between regions of the same Member State .
Prevention and combating violence against women are important strategic objectives for the progress that our civilisation is seeking .
I look forward to hearing your answer .
The interim results of the referendum in the 10 Southern States were published on 30 January and showed an overwhelming majority ( 9.5 % ) for secession .
Personally , I think that Europe needs a common energy policy so that we can avoid too much dependence on resources from one area .
The FVO also found huge gaps in the traceability system used by Brazil and discovered problems with many parties in transit to the EU which did not have the necessary certificates .
I will now give the floor to the committees concerned one after another .
So , in my opinion , the most important issue now is how we can build on the results of the Swedish Presidency .
The role of the European Union must be strengthened in the wake of this crisis .
The heart of this proposal is the emphasis that the dialogue is mutual , that it must be taken into account and respect the positions expressed .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to reconnect with Polish gas and city names in regions where most inhabitants come from the Polish minority .
As all these actions are linked , indispensable and are in line with the level of ambition laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result as soon as possible so that we meet the expectations of our citizens .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it represents an important improvement in the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour .
The aim of the report is to create a greater risk assessment , simplify bureaucratic surveillance mechanisms and create greater confidence in the scientific and business environment .
I agree with the comments made by Mr Daul .
The resolution we have adopted today clearly shows that the creation of a common register ensures the widest possible participation of actors in all categories , while respecting their different or specific identities .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has been busy because of what we have seen in the last few weeks from the Mediterranean , where many people fleeing the situation in Africa have not managed to get to Europe , while others have failed .
However , this is not what is happening : the situation in Lampedusa is a sad example of this .
Israel bombs and is becoming a ghetto .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the common agricultural policy and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
It must be a partnership based on mutual respect , on respect for our shared commitments and also on the values that the European Union stands for in terms of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and provides a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this context , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment calling for - not only with reference to Europe , of course , but also with the United States , as the Commissioner is well aware - an amendment that all forms of export subsidies are abolished completely and with immediate notice .
Most contributors highlight the need to change the CAP so as to focus on the competitiveness of European agriculture , the ability to respond to climate change , food security and quality requirements , as well as on other environmental requirements .
We also believe that the negotiations on the EU-Central America agreement should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , extremely important for the EU &apos;s specific support for cities to be increased , as this is where the great potential for the economy and finances lie , as cities have also been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will only be officially presented in the Committee on Budgetary Control next week .
In order to achieve a 25 to 40 % reduction in greenhouse gases , as experts recommend , and to halt the decline in biodiversity , we need considerable financial resources .
Only the carrot and stick , which represents the key dynamic of the accession process , can lead the governments of these countries to focus on the continuation of the work and the reforms that can once and for all consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will focus on two reports for their importance .
In order to create legal certainty for everyone involved , we must have the same rights throughout Europe for those accused of crimes , and it must be compulsory to inform about these rights .
Foreign Affairs and diplomacy fall under the nation state , which is why we have voted against all reports on this issue .
I can tell Mr Weber that I am referring to Rule 149 .
I also welcomed the positive assessment in the proposal for the continued efforts it made to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened to Greece a few hours ago will not infect , and on the contrary , it will mark the beginning of a united effort to create a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
I have been in touch from hour to hour with them in Tunisia and with the people of Egypt , with our delegations , which I salute for what they have had to do , and I have also been in direct contact with the government and with the services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument will be even more important in the light of the financial crisis , because it allows businesses to regain footprint and , in future , can become a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund .
These inspections were inadequate .
Then we can make a great contribution from Europe , but it cannot be a bottomless gap .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman for the European Parliament following his draft recommendation to the European Commission in complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , which relates to the disproportionate delays of the Commission in charging an answer to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
The most important progress achieved with this directive , compared to the existing legislation , is that patients will be able to choose their providers of healthcare and will have access to information about the quality and safety of the services they receive .
I would like to reiterate the need to call on the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as flexible as possible and to review the regional programmes financed under the Cohesion Fund so that they can be adapted to the requirements arising from the tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer rights organisations and industry representatives , I understand that we must insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I have said that anyone who raises questions is the villain of this debate .
This means that the European Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case , the trade negotiations - and to intervene from political standstill with the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as consultations , resolutions and oral questions , to be kept up-to-date on the situation with regard to these negotiations .
There is no recognition of citizens &apos; investment in social cohesion or intergenerational solidarity .
The real reform lies in admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union today .
To this end , financial resources must be available that will enable the European Union to seize the opportunities and to exploit new sources of global competitiveness .
In many countries in Europe where public authorities find themselves in a difficult situation , it is a known case that they are generally paying late and very often to blame for the bankruptcy of some companies .
The G20 conference also made the closure of tax havens one of the key objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
Of course , the loser remains No 1 in relation to global transactions and is still a safe investment , but the huge debt that the US has accumulated by making the rest of the world fund their lifestyle will increasingly call into question the ability of the major economic powers to fulfil its obligations .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures to combat and win over anyone who wants to destroy it .
Iceland had no interest in joining the European Union , as it was a country with a strong economy .
Mr Vice-President , there is nothing new in this request .
This is an excellent way of promoting sustainable development and of getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance .
However , it is a problem that will export the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions as long as the fighting in Afghanistan continues .
We must fight fragmentation , and I also call on Commissioner Andor to maintain the European Social Fund intact in the regulations and not split it up , as has sometimes been proposed here in Parliament .
In its nature , of course , we will not achieve all our wishes in a compromise ; what I believe to be important to us and what I would like to highlight , however , is that we have the prospect of a more environmentally friendly common agricultural policy .
Finally , I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure , and the rapporteurs L√°szl√≥ Surj√°n , Vladim√≠r Ma≈àka and Jutta Haug for their constructive attitude during this procedure , which represents the very good cooperation we have had .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Socialist Group cannot be unaffected by the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to emphasise that the negotiations are not unlimited , which would pave the way for more realistic alternatives , such as a priority partnership .
It is therefore , first and foremost , an American problem that must be tackled by the US Government .
Let me also say that we should carry out a reform that makes European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers and dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The quota they buy can be kept in the national reserve and distributed later if the Member States so wish .
Therefore , I would also like to appeal once again to you that , on 25 May , the date of your execution , the International Day of Rembrance in the fight against totalitarianism , because many unknown who , like Pilecki , lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be remembered .
Let me briefly mention what we have done .
If this opinion becomes an expression of the position of the majority of the European Union in the next parliamentary term , this will destroy the economic heavy peace plan drawn up following the wars in the Balkans .
I hope this will encourage organisations to participate in EMAS , not because I will play with figures and see EMAS compete with the ISO , but because I believe that this scheme is good and can help us meet the sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker takes a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have observed , it is a very important vote to take place tomorrow , and I believe that it will go well .
Monetary dumping and the social consequences that this entails must no longer be allowed to happen .
This is an absolutely essential element in ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
By defining best practice based on the experience of the Member States and respecting basic standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we still have the basis for a coherent European policy on this issue .
I am aware that in the public consultation with the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , the sheet sector recommended compulsory origin marking .
I am well aware that this is a complex issue .
Although most countries are experiencing a series of economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to combating the negative consequences of climate change .
I ask for support for this mechanism .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary negotiations on the reform of the European Community &apos;s own resources .
So the overall eligibility of these measures has been improved .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission , as the European Parliament , has the right to express its opinion on the review process .
For example , the task of fraud in France and Spain is considered to be &apos; suspicious &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solutions and in whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to create a network for exchanging statistical data across the Member States , as well as a platform for coordination of research on the grounds of , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view expressed by many in this House that the more European solidarity we have , the better the relationship between Europe and Russia .
It has a long way to go with regard to freedom of speech and assembly .
Much still needs to be done before we can guarantee equal access to the labour market for women .
However , let me reiterate that the proposal should be reviewed again in order to take the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon into account .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is untenable .
I supported the report because I would particularly like to highlight a threat mentioned in the report : the lack of real and exhaustive information to consumers about the health characteristics , composition and origin of individual species .
After all , history is full of examples of interventions by Western countries which did more harm than benefit .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is quite ineffective and , for several reasons , cannot be used to prevent crime .
This Palestinian agreement is a key political event and , unlike what has been said here , Hamas has agreed for the first time that the PLO and the Palestinian Authority act as its negotiating partners .
Countries are hatred and negotiating how the sea can be split up .
The last is of particular importance , especially when you know about the energy infrastructure problems that ...
In other words , it is precisely the institution that must protect us against criminals ( indirectly by providing professional training to police officers ) that ends up being the gas chaos .
However , Fidel Castro &apos;s transfer of power to his bridges , Ra√∫l , has led neither to democratic reforms nor to the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency figures must also be specified in any advertising containing information about energy consumption or the price of the product .
You are all familiar with the so-called Washington Consensus ; they loved it .
In this way , we would actually be able to respond effectively to the facts that Frontex is still facing .
To conclude , I would like once again to thank not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive work .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this matter and I appreciate very much the support of the Presidency in our efforts to find a possible way out .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s strong interest in the private sector sector is making him particularly suitable for ensuring a balance between EU legislation and the specific needs both in the market and among the population of the EU .
Until now , this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days &apos; time .
The number of falsified medicinal products will only fall and will their use be made safer if measures of this kind are taken .
In addition , we must learn from the Opel case , as it is not yet too late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automobile industry .
We did many of these things because , like you , President Obama and I reject the artificial choice between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Euro Pact proposes making wage savings a permanent element .
Recently , a new trial was started at Manchester airport and they have now received legal advice that the use of these appliances can be a violation of the Law on the Safety and Protection of Children because of the maths of the picture produced .
Moreover , this money does not go directly to the performers .
As far as civil aviation is concerned , the development of the system and the use of EGNOS-based landing procedures must be supported .
Invention and survey of the activities of ships and maritime authorities ( recast ) - Inspectation and survey of ships ( recast ) - Havnestate control ( recast ) - Traffic Monitoring and Information System for Shipping in the Community - Shipment of Shipastures in the maritime transport sector - Maritime transport operators &apos; liability in the event of passengers - Ship Record and Information System for Ship and Traffic System ( Ship in Ship and Traffic System ) - Ship in the Ship in the Ship in the Ship in the Ship in , Ship in , Ship in , Ship in , Shipile ) - Shipile ( debate ) Export and Fair ( Shipasty Regulation ( Shipastures and Maritime transport requirements ) Export ) Export and Maritime transport
I am voting in favour of the report on a new microfinance facility that will help people whose jobs are at risk to create or develop micro-enterprises .
It is important that some progress has been made in this direction with Mr Vlas√°k &apos;s report , which I am very much in favour of , as I believe that with this report , we can better define the legal framework for the urban issue and also introduce tools such as the operational programmes of the municipalities which will bring new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue , I was aware that the amendments I tabled to Parliament have a significant impact on a fair and efficient energy market .
During the current economic crisis , it is extremely important that self-employed people be supported and encouraged .
In short , you do not need to ask Brussels for them .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , it is clear to us and to Europe because the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us in Europe that energy has become a foreign policy tool , an element of change that can create conflicts or unify us , and that is precisely the subject we are dealing with today .
I voted in favour of this report because , if enlargement is under consideration , the food programme is a key instrument for helping the most disadvantaged , which is suffering greatly from the current economic crisis , even when it comes to meeting basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least an official export credit agency , and these constitute under the main source of state funding for projects in the private sector as a whole .
For this reason , we are not voting in favour of the report .
By taking this position , we have helped to destroy this common government .
With the creation of &apos; Conseil Fran√ßais du , Mr President , in 2003 , Mr Sarkozy , who was then Minister for the Interior , brought Islam to the French institutions .
I have already asked the Commission to give its opinion on this issue and to consider the possibility of setting up special programmes to ensure equal opportunities for women in the field of science .
This is a fight that we will continue to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unrestricted access to services for end users .
Europe &apos;s big politicians and thinking well understood that the force that could unite Europe was a common approach to economic problems .
The boundary between freedom and security does not end up at borders with the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that from this summer , the Commission will take on a leading role in coordinating the strategy for developing key areas such as promoting education in citizenship , business guidance and employment .
The costs will be paid out by the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do in order to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the area .
We can therefore expect a reactor accident every 25 years .
In my opinion , the increased eligibility of housing for expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF must lead us to consider other possible developments in the medium and long term , whether it is in terms of funding eligibility or of earmarking funds for certain strategic priorities .
Now is the time to talk again about violations of religious rights in these two countries , but this time it is about Christians .
Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing our planet .
As expected , a huge amount of attention was paid to human rights and the importance of ensuring that this aspect is clearly part of all our dynamic relations which are tending towards our areas of work .
I must also say that the European Union has so far no jurisdiction whatsoever in regulating aviation .
However , Europe is not a trap or a cure for overcoming an economic crisis .
I can thus confirm to the rapporteur the commitment that the Commission has already made with regard to the comitology procedure and the optional provisions .
I do not believe that any of the warm words expressed here today , even those expressed by the Commission , can alter the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya and that the Union is currently unable to even bring an end to the urban crisis or to the acts carried out by Mr Gaddafi &apos;s troops .
I am therefore convinced that it would be of great benefit to EU citizens if Parliament were to approve these two regulations , because they would then have far more choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I , too , hope that the European Council will adopt measures to reassure the markets and re-establish stability in the euro area because , whether we are a member or not , we all have an interest in it .
The pre-accession aid has proved to be particularly receptive .
Thank you for that and welcome it .
We therefore call for the war to end and for the violence that all parties are exerting to be brought to an end , and we urge the European Union to act accordingly .
The outside world has the energy challenge just before us .
An indicator who indicates the energy efficiency of a building must be included in advertisements concerning sales or rental , as shown in the media .
It is essential to encourage efforts aimed at increasing EU investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , incentives for the production of alternative , unconventional energy sources at local level and improving infrastructure in order to make it easier to use of new energy sources .
A well developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , which , in turn , leads to growth in internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we must consider the creation of a rapid instrument for action within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy in order to be able to respond quickly and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as happened recently in the Southern Neighbourhood Policy .
In my opinion , it is simply grotesque that a Member of the European Parliament who supports Serbia should condemn EULEX .
The problem , therefore , is that the only Members who hear you are the ones who can do so in the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am concerned that the Swedish Presidency places the emphasis on issues of interest to our fellow citizens , our constituents : the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , job security and the fight against crime , because if we are to do a good job , we must be in harmony with those who have voted on .
The EU budget cannot be used , as some Members of the European Parliament claim , as a complement to national budgets in times of crisis ; rather , it should reflect the difficult situation faced by EU Member States .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the treaty does not give the Council any power to intervene on the national constitutions of the Member States .
It is not business as usual .
You may name me cynically , but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always come to visits for a limited period .
Is the global financial crisis , which became an economic crisis , guilty of this situation , or are we dealing with our own mistakes , neglections and a lack of action ?
My second &apos; but &apos; is about the role that the Belgian Presidency has played following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The main aim of these regimes was and is to keep the same on the territory of this huge state , which is inhabited by a wide range of diverse peoples .
( PL ) Mr President , although many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
It must be said , with only a few exceptions , that when we talk about Japan , I recognise Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect its prices market , to protect its farmers , to pay more than the world market prices and to say &apos; no &apos; to massive imports that would delete the Japanese bona population , in the same way that I recognise our Member States &apos; right to protect certain sectors .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to talk about two things : coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
I will therefore work firmly on this strategy to strengthen the social priority , as I have already said , when we discussed the broader policy guidelines for the next mandate .
I will therefore go straight to the matter and ask you what measures - and I use the majority form here - the Commission intends to take in the short term to resolve these problems .
This is exactly what has been missing up to now or which we have not made sufficiently clear to our citizens .
It does not interest the citizens , and that is not so special .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal by approving Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report by a very large majority .
At the same time , Romania has supported the open-door policy with the particular aim of strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
In addition , I firmly believe that we must do everything we can to mitigate the consequences of the disaster and restore living conditions .
I am thinking not only of accidents in the workplace , which is a rather frequent phenomenon ahead , but also of the dangerous substances used in work processes .
In September 2009 , the Council began the detailed review of the proposal amending the resolution establishing the European Refugee Fund .
Here , it is important , in particular , to take account of the island and the outermost regions , which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , are now facing a destroyed infrastructure and the loss of personal , commercial and agricultural property , and which , in many cases , cannot renew ordinary activities straight away , especially in regions which are almost entirely dependent on tourism , as the media descriptions of the events can hold potential visitors .
We have not seen such a protracted disruption to the operation of such enormous financial losses since 11 September 2001 and , regardless of the financial problems that all Member States are currently experiencing , I urge them to join plans to support an industry that simply cannot afford more losses .
At the same time , we must recognise that our exposure to risks is also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is terrible .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a minor , semanantist comment .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You might want something to happen - you can have a very strong desire for something to happen - but you have to face up to the reality .
Consumer organisations prefer binding measures on a collective redress system in all Member States , combining with other options , such as extending existing systems of alternative conflict resolution of collective redress .
The problem is not the Turkish Cypriots , as some have said .
I would like to ask the Commission what they do to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their country of origin without having to do through a long and painful transport to the consumer .
That is what we must do .
Frankly , I ask myself why we are not hearing anything from those human rights defenders who , like us , are happy that the West is secular and pluralist and who , with shame , turns away from a Middle East that is slightly dominated by a single religion .
It is being done , and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
The banks , who are withdrawing our money , are despicable , but Mr Schulz , politicians who are now working up deficits and debts which will be going to impose on future generations , are equally irresponsible .
I would therefore like to thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs of the individual groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to do as expected of them .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument of democracy and human rights was good and , in fact , the relationship was very cooperative .
We should strive to ensure that the programmes offered provide maximum support for the reforms in the countries concerned in order to bring them closer to the European Union .
It is also very important for all Member States to establish national contact points in order to provide patients with all the necessary information , i.e. about the availability of healthcare and administrative procedures , as well as about the necessary documentation .
In the past , we all witnessed events in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , but we are now discussing trade in a climate of absolute individual freedom .
Whether it is a private or a public fund , this report deals with a very concrete issue , namely , that Parliament first states that the fund does not have any legal requirements for the coverage of its deficit and , secondly , that such deficit coverage will not take place .
It must be the most expensive faces since the allegation of Helena of Troika , which sought thousands of ships .
Support leading to distortions of competition undermines the future of the European automotive industry and will have negative consequences for employment as well as technological development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that there are a few things that we must bear in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard various MEPs say that we want a more robust Stability and Growth Pact by a reverse majority .
( FR ) After all that has been said , I think it is extremely important to remind each other of what is really at stake here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
In order to show your solidarity with the campaign against this barbaric ritual ritual , I call on you all to bear a rosenblad as a symbol of our opposition to this practice .
Democratic scrutiny will be sidelined , since national governments hide behind the Commission and the troika in relation to the most fundamental measures , while the Commission refers these issues to national governments .
Investment in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
Following threats from the Commission to entry to the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now begun to authorise deca-BDE .
It is very clear to us who come from the elections to the country and those who are in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the situation faced by many livestock farmers is quite simply untenable .
Carers deserve transparent information that is easy to understand and easily accessible .
I think it could be our job to support the Chinese people in their realisation of a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms during the vote because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to increase budgetary stability in Europe , and thus safeguard our future .
It is equally important that whoever organises the initiative - a social organisation or a non-governmental organisation - clearly clarifies the subject and the purpose of the initiative , although not necessarily must be presented with a legislative proposal .
There is a town in Latvia , Daughtu , where more than 90 % of the population is Russia &apos;s pleasant .
In this context , I would like to welcome the apologies made by Prime Minister Jan Fischer and the recent decision of the Czech Government , which requires the health department by 31 December 2009 to take a number of measures to ensure that such atrocities are no longer taking place .
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity and has become a standard measuring instrument used by policy makers throughout the world .
Now the effects of globalisation have been completely neglected by the financial and economic crisis , and our measured response is to adapt the criteria for EGF aid .
This resolution takes note of the declaration of independence of Kosovo in 17 February 2008 , which has been recognised by 69 countries , and encourages the Member States to strengthen their common approach towards Kosovo with a view to joining the European Union .
Compared to the other institutions , Parliament can still be considered to lead the way in matters of transparency , and therefore I will not make it my top priority , because with regard to both the accessibility of documents and transparency at meetings and the activities of the European Parliament , we are more transparent than any national parliament .
It was internal politicisation by the Italian Minister for reform , Umberto Bossi .
The warnings given by the Human Rights Observatory in Asturias - my region - and by many other organisations deserve to be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of Mr Cassini &apos;s report .
I strongly regret the adoption of this resolution banning thrombin from cattle and swine .
I have therefore chosen to abstain and will closely follow the ongoing investigation .
Nevertheless , the data supplied by the Commission are also not entirely accurate in need of the introduction of measures to be used to discipline those Member States with the highest proportion of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions by 20 % in sectors not covered by the ETS scheme .
Concerning the second question , I can assure Members of Parliament that the Commission is aware that control of resistance to anti-microbial medicines requires a cross-cutting approach .
Yesterday &apos;s trialogue provides plenty of hope for a final agreement .
From the perspective of an annual indignation bill of roughly 27 % in the coming years , notes that this figure will be up to EUR 11 billion .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adjusted so that there is going to be a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many have asked me what ACTA stands for , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of the report as the EU &apos;s financial support will help the citizens who are victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and face the crisis .
As the Internet is the most important instrument for creating better conditions and development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms , especially through deployment of audiovisual content , I am pleased that this report has been adopted , and I hope that the European Union will play a leading role in radio spectrum and in developing new , innovative software .
All of this is well in line with the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe and the problems that would arise by taking up a country that shares a border with more than 80 million inhabitants ; tractors that continue to strengthen me in my unwavering belief that Turkey should not join the European Union , the unity of which is based above all else on the Christian spirit .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests )
It will be a setback for the environment and consumer safety , because old and possibly dangerous high-energy equipment will be placed back on the market .
I look forward to following the debate .
I would like to thank the mayor in the Balingen , Dr Reitemann , and the local council for authorising the removal of this mindekran to the credit of these young men .
Thirdly , I would like to urge Mrs Kroes to speed up digitisation in the Member States if , in future , we want to be proud of this major flagship project .
Anyone who experienced the impact of the environmental disaster in Baia Mare , which was caused by the weakness of this method , and the subsequent erosion of toxic waste containing cyanide to waterway , with far-reaching consequences for the Fauna in the Tisza River in Hungary and for the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything they could to ensure that something similar could never happen again in the European Union .
It is everyone &apos;s responsibility : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year .
Then there is the principle that displaced persons have the right to return to their homes and property : the fundamental freedom of movement that you mentioned to cross the border .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when it proposes rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What matters is that we had the courage to convene this summit , that we invited the social partners to take part , that we will prepare it together with them over a period , because , prior to the summit , we will hold three round-table discussions in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague , and that we will try to reach conclusions that will be useful for the summit in June .
Parliament established , at first reading , a good basis for the proper application of the rules on cross-border healthcare in the Member States in such a way that patients who were justified and in accordance with the established rules , and without burdening the courts , could receive the ambulant treatment or hospital treatment they needed in another Member State .
