Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions from the report discussed on Wednesday in the European Parliament show us that the importation of agricultural products from third countries has much more detrimental effects on the environment than internal production , subject to stricter regulations on the reduction of carbon emissions , with the result that it contributes to climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that the countries that have received these resources cannot use them .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
Shipping organisations in the Member States must cooperate much more closely to harmonise their training programmes and offer opportunities to find paid work and to exchange experiences with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
And we can see that we have ever more demands on our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened , and the EU must also rigorously oblige the Member States &apos; authorities to meet their obligations .
I would like to add a point which has not been made so far by any other than Commissioner Almunia .
The sectors that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change are mainly as follows : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity , and last but not least , the health of the population .
Let me also express my personal sadness , as well as the Commission , about the deaths of nine Turkish soldiers and a police officer from terrorist attacks last week .
Commissioner Piebalgs , congratulations on everything you do .
However , it is a good thing that , following the opposition and concern expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education over the deterioration of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is growing and affects many European Union Member States , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I voted for , which increase the initial appropriations ( e.g. Article 150202 ) .
The leadership of a minority government has taken on a completely different political orientation , but no one regarded it as a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , the international community , have simply been watching , as the Abyei issue was uncovered in the referendum , is very irresponsible and one way of resuming war in the future .
The case of the Romanian patron of Marian Cozma , murdered with brutality by two members of the Hungarian Rome Society , shows to us once again that crime knows no borders and that this society &apos;s problems are counterproductive .
We need to have a strong EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should be a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to combine the resources of the Member States in order to achieve the best results , and in terms of dealing with common strategies and businesses , which will also make Europe a political union that its founding fathers dreamed up years ago .
That is our request .
We are all , as Hungary has always been , supporters of the Single Market .
The inevitable climate change forces the European Union &apos;s society and economy to adapt to a new reality .
Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and help to find both socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It has been a brilliant three-year question relationship , as are most short-term questions , I am pleased to see that it is coming to an end .
It is necessary to maintain continuous vigilance of NATO and to support Afghanistan in particular at this juncture .
Something should happen , however , and we will have to get things moving .
In this respect , common aspects such as reducing VAT rates , exceptions to the scheme , the possibility to introduce a maximum rate and , lastly , the taxation of intra-Community traditions should be considered .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the largest youth unemployment and our car industry has been decimating , partly because the European Union has financed jobs in Slovakia which have stripped substantial jobs from the Ryton plant .
It is important to ensure that these new bodies do not accept any pressure that will weaken or undermine the ground rules for reform of the financial sector .
Enough is enough !
We should also encourage the creation of a network of research centres that can share a specialist infrastructure and exchange useful information and data .
Qimonda complies with the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of setting up the European Asylum Support Office as the situation in third countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating all the time .
Mr Severin has rightly stressed the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs strong US and the US need a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council could explain to us what proportion of this flow of refugees could be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that , in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to lift these visas .
After all , exposing the scandal has not been carried out by an EU food inspector or by an EU food safety agency , but by the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we must use our vision of military capabilities with the emphasis on soft power and prevention to address a new agenda , which preceded it but clarified in Munich , as President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter a new era of disarmament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me tonight to present the report on the budgetary aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been ready for some time now in the Committee on Budgets .
In September , the members of the Democratic Movement party did not vote in favour of Mr Barroso &apos;s appointment as President of the Commission , as his history did not recommend his re-election .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that our interest is focused on animal welfare , that animals are living in suitable conditions for every species and that animals are healthy and robust , according to the principle that prevention is better than cure .
We now fear that if the scope of this directive expands , the directive will have exactly the same fate as the previous attempt to introduce &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , that the Council will once again prevent it from being blocked .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members who are proposing that politicians , Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts to economic recovery .
Countries like the United Kingdom and the US , which have both deficits of over 10 % , should make significant adjustments to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should keep these matters separate , because otherwise Prime Minister Leterme should comment on the new media law in Hungary and I do not think that he has such competence .
There is also a very clear lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
In addition to offending wine producers following a quality policy in particular to Provence , it would be unacceptable to legalise a by-product originating from the mixing of integrated products and allowing misleading references to rosé colour .
However , there are too many things still to be done .
What will happen is job losses throughout the agricultural Europe and reduce our capacity in food production .
Let us not forget that , in addition to these institutional issues , the current Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is , of course , deeply affected by the need to resolve the issue of climate change , by the need to resolve the issue of the economic crisis , by the concern in Europe about the need for a policy on job creation - many important issues that need to be addressed .
I stress , however , that we know very well that there are many texts that are necessary for police and judicial cooperation and which need to be given a new legal basis , thus allowing Parliament to exercise its role as colegislator .
I would also like to express my approval to the rapporteurs for the fact that they have raised the element of ethics , which , of course , falls within the scope of the Member States .
This is good because , at the end of the day , young people will determine the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must also remember those who have already made a very important contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we are working on an Economic Recovery Plan , to which we are giving three and a half billion to the oligarchy of energy giants and not a single euro to whose partners we need help in getting rid of green energy .
Fish quotas and stock management are essential in order to prevent full overfishing of inland water and oceans .
We would prefer Parliament &apos;s resources to be increased through redistributions and measures to increase efficiency rather than by increasing the overall budget .
Moreover , this package could show that the European institutions can work together in a responsible , effective and constructive way in such an important area .
I believe that adopting a front-loading approach , as advocated by the Commission in its recast proposal , in other words , improving first-instance procedures , will allow us to achieve real economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and the consensus on the regulation on animal by-products was reached at first reading .
We do not want to export European jobs to countries that do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we have here .
All the proposals were helpful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
We must work hard to reach a consensus among the 27 Member States that reflects the unity of Europe and its will to overcome the crisis and safeguard the essential content of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for democracy and human rights and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the highest potential for growth .
Then money was only designated for two types of projects aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) and wind parks in the North Sea .
If there was a proposal for EGF money to be made available to redundant workers in Britain , we would be voting in favour of it and we would be critical if we did not .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the Court is fully working , but it is still at a nursery stage .
It concerns our neighbours , and includes our closest neighbours such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as some outermost neighbours , such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I am very committed , together with my colleagues in the Commission , to gender mainstreaming into all the policies that we are going to present .
These plans will help eliminate differences in connections between the systems in the European Union and make it possible to make further use of the same energy sources in the European Union .
In addition , this approach is based on politics , and I believe that Europe , above all , needs more politics , and that , of course , includes the powers of our Parliament .
There is also the issue of FIFA &apos;s inability to introduce the technology for the father line when other sports have already done so .
After all , we are in a position to organise a wide range of training or laboratories programmes , in which we can genuinely contribute to access to EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas .
There are others who use the absence of such a policy as a pretext to justify their bilateral understandings with suppliers , often ignoring the requirements of transparency and healthy competition , not to mention European solidarity .
In addition , I welcome the fact that we have also been able to create a closer relationship of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
In particular , many Member States have made remarkable efforts to fulfil their obligations in relation to the Pact .
The aim is for the EU to be able to find answers to the major social challenges that concern all Member States and that they cannot cope with on their own ( ageing population and health , energy , water supply and food , sustainable development , climate change , etc . ) , as well as to develop knowledge that will enable our businesses to be more innovative and increase their competitiveness .
Although we will be in favour of the resolution tomorrow , I think that there are some inconsistencies in this budget , and I would like to highlight two of those that are , to my mind , essential .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will promote further issues of governance of the world economy , particularly with regard to the regulation of financial services and the monitoring of the G20 in Pittsburgh .
I would , however , like to look at the matter a little in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist them in their reintegration into the labour market .
The depth of the problem lies in Europeans &apos; desire to no longer accept the consequences of freedom of establishment , which would necessarily abstain from accession .
It is a role without recognition , a difficult role .
This objective is high on the list of our priorities .
However , the EU &apos;s support is essential to ensure that this country is independent .
The Israeli Government is rapidly continuing colonies , and this after committing war crimes at the beginning of the year .
Evaluations and additional visits by expert groups demonstrated that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still maintains the five surface long-liners that it had before .
the increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities that will contribute to a new arms competition ;
I would also like to stress the contradiction between the commitment made by the government of Pakistan to religious freedom and , on the one hand , its leading role in the organisation of Islamic states to adopt the agenda of &apos; combating the defamation of religion &apos; in the United Nations .
I am saying that this afternoon because I sincerely believe it .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is satisfactory because it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , it is absolutely essential that European governments and institutions intervene promptly , coordinated , such as implementing programmes for withdrawing old cars against a consistent reduction in the price of purchasing a new car , providing financial support , and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is correct , but it does not seem to be very much in line with the extremely important entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , so the functions and competences that today share in the two pillars will be consolidated will be consolidated .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , you are asking the question &apos; .
Such a policy will fail , if people working in the fishing industry , fishermen to traders selling fish to consumers , do not comply with the rules .
This expensive , failed registration for debates by the parliament , which suffers as a strange illusion of accountable democracy , a monstrous deception of the electorate who sent us here .
This is unfortunate , because normally , we should raise a united front here .
We no longer say that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe while , in a way , we do not care because the climate issue must prevail .
The burden of debt - the painful elements of which we are now seeing - is hampering economic growth , not only in our European countries but also in the United States .
Moreover , this report will help clarify the various agreements on air transport , as well as to conclude them in the most simple way possible , while also mentioning the criteria on which we need to focus our attention and the aspects that we need to follow .
I will be voting in favour of the telecommunications package , but with sufficient reservation , because I believe that the basic principle of liberalising the telecommunications sector has not been respected , which has to be achieved by this directive .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
These will have greater results and lower costs for the taxpayer if we can coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to facilitate the EU &apos;s issuing of visas for Belarusians and to reach a readmission agreement .
Let me give you a specific example .
Let us take a look , for example , at bringing up children and schools .
Nor do we yet know whether the standards we promote in relation to legal trade in timber will be put into practice and will operate globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this problem .
Setting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body for analysis and evaluation of the degree of coordination of the actions taken by the Member States to support sustainable and qualitative growth is crucial .
I voted in favour of changing the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow more effective vaccines to be used and to reduce bureaucracy for farmers .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of this report insofar as it calls for the definition of strong , integrated EU policies .
With my abstention , I wish to express my deep disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which was well below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payment often causes difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , no one questions this , but we should not insist on all the efforts made by citizens , since they are our only hope to overcome this crisis .
In the United States , they have an early warning system for this purpose .
One of these cases concerns one of my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together we must defend our rights , our freedoms and our democracy .
Speed up : that is what the Europeans called for when they elected this European Parliament , and that is what we have to give them if we want to see more of them vote in five years &apos; time .
The parts of the text for which the European Council is responsible have been discussed and agreed by the European Council itself .
Private consumption costs have risen by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At this point , I think it would be useful to express effective views on the right ways to strengthen existing legislation .
The summit conclusions are very vague about this .
To this end , the proposal offers uniform headings which allow enforcement or preventive measures to avoid problems recognising and translation of the instruments of other Member States and an example of the notification of documents relating to requirements on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because they take into account important policy areas and the various points of view .
The Commission can support Member States with financing programmes for cooperation at European level .
For example , decisions by the Council on 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 established the possibility for Member States to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level in order to prosecute these crimes which fortunately - and we all remember General Pinochetle - are also part of the legislation of some Member States .
Thank you .
Also , my vote should not be interpreted as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy tone &apos; .
Our markets are becoming ever more frequent from distance , and the Internet has now changed our habits completely , partly because the pace of our lives is becoming increasingly central .
On information , we are constantly providing information as soon as we receive it .
To conclude , I would like to say that the best investment is an investment in the education of the new generation , by which I mean lifelong education .
We want the abolition of the death penalty everywhere in the world .
These issues have been resolved to a satisfactory degree in the final text of agreement with the Council , and we are pleased about this .
( Applause from the centre-left )
In this case , thousands of people are affected , often with small children , and without sufficient financial resources .
Procedures are completely different when it comes to appealing to the Commission under the provisions of the forthcoming Treaty and going to Parliament through the petitions process .
Human rights must be respected by all sides of the conflict in the Middle East .
( EL ) Mr President , the crisis concerning Greece &apos;s debt has asked questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to shoulder our responsibilities .
We understand that , in any case , UNESCO has made representations to the Chinese authorities about the impact of development on traditional heritage and traditional culture in Kashgar .
in writing . - The Member of the European Parliament , Mr Schwab , has proposed a report aimed at increasing the safety of cars by introducing increased safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have demonstrated our ability to act and have reinforced our resistance .
If we talk about Parliament &apos;s position towards external actors , for example human rights organisations that could be affected by it , and if we do not reach an agreement , although I hope that this will not happen , and if individual projects cannot be realised , I believe there is support and understanding for Parliament &apos;s position .
These Thursday afternoon sittings are becoming increasingly surreal on Thursday afternoon in this Chamber , both in terms of the absence observed and the issues for discussion and how it is handled .
I believe that it is absolutely unclear whether Moldova will be able to elect its president and , if this does not happen , it will obviously lead to new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 and 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency at the same time .
Madam President , I , too , endorse this compromise , because it puts on the table democratic deficits that women were facing in particular , when it helped their self-employed spouses to trade , craftspeople , craftspeople , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , without , of course , recognising their work over time .
Of course , our political choices are obviously different and sometimes inconsistent .
I would call it climate justice , because it concerns the relationship between developing and developed countries and the will to come up with a credible proposal to finance mitigation and adaptation measures and how we show that we are ready to play a leading role .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid granted to the banks , which benefited from this aid , but did not take a corresponding social approach .
Not only do I have three children , but I also have an intrinsic one , which is currently only milk .
We are ready to draw up technical assistance programmes accompanying the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities will have to implement .
We expect the Commission to present it .
As you say , we need to keep renew our statistics and Eurostat examines this issue .
Sometimes , I wonder whether we have not yet learned enough lessons about the consequences of our course of action when we do not apply European solutions to European problems and try to find something specialist , even though we need to deal with it collectively .
These emails also reveal that scientists who are sceptical about this affair have been excluded from peer review procedures in order to avoid the duplication of the weaknesses of the investigations , following the submission of them to public scrutiny .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet sheds some light on this very dark aspect of society with which we are still struggling , and we are struggling very poorly .
It is known what kind of people we have to do , so the authorities need to understand , in terms of inspections , that the risk is higher and that controls should therefore be stricter .
Our priority during our work on the review of the RoHS Directive was to strengthen safety standards for electrical devices and electronic parts for sale in the European Union .
Some work is done mainly in schools , because this social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependency .
It was found to reunite the continent with the end of the Cold War and it is now called upon to maintain its previous achievements and continue to complete it once the favourable circumstances come back .
There are many Members who wish to answer their questions tonight and , for reasons of respect , we would like to follow the planned procedure .
But those of us who were involved in this task knew that there was no alternative , that the problems of the dairy farming sector had to be solved , and we hope that now we are close to solving some of the problems that this part of the sector has encountered .
Secondly , while the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provisions , we have chosen to abstain from similar references to this report because we oppose the dictatisation of any family policy at European level ; this is a matter for national governments .
Finally , I believe that the next discussions that we will have on this subject should concern the issue of the EUBAM &apos;s marked transit point : how to update this mission and how it may be extended .
The Commission is therefore following the situation and , if need be , the Commission will act , but I believe that we should not go beyond the structures provided for in Community law and the Commission will certainly remain under Community law .
Given that our common vision is to see a real European diplomatic service that is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we are going to vote on tomorrow is of fundamental importance .
in writing . - On the basis of the persistent gap between men and women in terms of unemployment rates , wages and access to administrative positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislation .
I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try and confirm through the Commissioner the fact that there will be no further progress in the next few weeks , namely , unless these fraudsters are handed over .
We will be discussing this issue shortly , in the context of the discussions on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
The European Parliament has today adopted , Wednesday 20 October , the report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already talk of raising taxes in the near future so that public finances do not have a problem .
Today , the time has come to express loud our demands for Christians and other religions to be practising their religion .
In the EU , 31.5 % of women have part-time ( 30 hours or less week ) , while the figure of men is 8.3 % of them .
I share the sceptical optimism of both the Commission &apos;s and the Minister and feel that the skies are clearing , but there are still many clouds .
At the time , a few of us would be able to dress the scale of the upcoming economic crisis .
Parliament is therefore heading in the right direction , showing that it is on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
This policy has become a crucial element in the economic recovery package , providing added value and supporting efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , while at the same time being a means of showing European solidarity .
It is also regrettable that we do not yet know whether and when the Lisbon Treaty will come into force , and it will clearly have to enter into force without further hesitation .
However , I feel that the situation is clearly demonstrating the disastrous difficulties of the agricultural industry , certainly in my region , if farmers should be crushed over the course of the winter months in securing modest sums of EU season .
The Member States in southern Europe have been too late in doing so .
This must be done by implementing smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will in a democratic vote , so tomorrow is an extremely important day .
It has to be said that housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in the modern welfare state .
In my opinion , the definition of political priorities means that they should be verified , transparent and democratic .
This specific work concerns the development of a traffic management system .
( HU ) Over the last few months , in the Vojvodina region , in northern Serbia , a climate of fear has once again prevailed between the various nationalities there , mainly Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - a sometimes difficult compromise - and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have managed , on our behalf , to come to a result that is applicable and feasible .
in writing . - While we agree with the points made by the proposal that provide for equal treatment for Parliament and the Council in respect of access to meetings and information , systematic dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives , impact assessments and the use of non-binding legislative measures ( rather than physical law ) , we disagree with : confirming and strengthening compulsory time limits for the application of directives and the European Union .
Everybody knows that it is not possible to emit without access to radio spectrum , and EU policy is to ensure non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum for all market participants .
This strategy will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for action from the Commission on progress in equality between men and women in the areas that my colleague has just mentioned , from employment to the other ways in which it is important to ensure and ensure this equality .
We are looking forward to seeing the other political and economic parts of great influence subjecting offers to the table , which has not yet happened for several of them .
Dementia and Alzheimer &apos;s in particular are not only a serious problem , from a medical point of view , but also a highly sensitive , ethical and social point of view , problem which the seriousness will continue to exacerbate with the ageing of Europe &apos;s population .
I would also like to say that you have taken great care to say that there should be no confusion over the various competences and , of course , I too do not wish to confuse the competences of the Member States and the powers of the European Union either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs for understanding the details of this issue : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have given them our hand and , with the full support of all the European institutions , I would ask Minsk to keep it , because that is also what the people of Belarus will gain .
We have to keep a very close eye on what is happening , because the President said that we would have an annual savings of EUR 38 billion from European companies .
Now , following the decision against Liu Xiaobo , we have even seen the prohibition of a party of homosexuals by the police , which is threatening to lead to a political era of the glaciers for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine has been very clear today .
We have to recognise that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved , because only through the parliaments can the majority of the regulations be adapted , and that this process and proposals in relation to the Transatlantic Legislators &apos; Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of the utmost importance .
Someone mentioned helicopters .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , I was very pleased to see and hear you .
That is the point I would like to emphasise as regards this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today the European Parliament is sending a strong signal to women who are helping their spouses to do a self-employed capacity .
Anyone who has been in Gaza since the conflict can certify the great suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is , from a strategic point of view , the most important relationship of the European Union .
I have to say that our ambition is to reach political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better in less money .
At the same time , the large number of participants at the Copenhagen conference fills me with hope that the actions of such a large number of allies will eventually have a chance of success .
Mr President , I want to speak in favour of the motion not to have a resolution because I have heard Mr Schulz say something , which is very important to me : if we really want this debate to be about &apos; Europe &apos; , and not just Italy , there is no need to have a resolution called &apos; Freedom of Information in Italy &apos; .
Therefore , I have decided to vote in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament proposes the adoption of the Council Regulation without further delay , because the new regulation will simplify the application of procedures and ensure equal treatment of the legitimate residents of third countries with regard to social security .
This is a scandalous percentage that I mentioned in a report I drafted during the previous term of office of this Parliament .
However , an EU Arctic policy is perhaps not as bizarre as its appointment without any conducive Baroness Ashton , Sarah Palin the former student left , as the High Representative .
One such achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October ; it is quite simply the most ambitious trade agreement that the European Union has ever concluded and remains a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment on freezing the budget at 2013 levels , as I am profoundly convinced that this is a necessary reduction , and their position is a weak starting point for the negotiations .
I think , as far as the car industry is concerned , that we have paid very little attention to the development of completely new types of cars , cars that move on by hydrogen , with batteries and fuel cycles .
Then our paths will be divided .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thai , the European Union is ready to support the country as much as possible during this complicated process .
Indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth , is of real benefit to local populations and does not harm European fishery product processing and canning industries , it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible , and to allow it to be suspended if needed .
This is what the Commission and the Council are now doing in a very laudable way to ensure that the supply of gas is resumed as soon as possible .
It is essential that Member States carry out research without delay into extreme human rights violations against Roma women , that sanctions be imposed on perpetrators and ensure that the identities of all victims have been identified and that they have been reimbursed .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a rather complex issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies , as well as - and this is not mentioned - the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and , in particular , with the European committees on cases , budgets and budget control .
I would suggest that , now that the European External Action Service establishes its rules on access to information and access to documents , please make it a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens and does not deal with foreign policy as if it were only the remit of some mysterious diplomats .
All countries are currently in the process of amending their economic policy with a view to getting out of the difficult economic situation as quickly as possible and achieving some economic growth .
Let me tell you something also about the Japanese people .
Mr Barroso replied to me that this was an internal matter .
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened , but rather preserved and strengthened .
I cannot imagine that the mutual dialogue that we have between us every day should be deprived of the values in which we believe .
While separation is helpful to large companies , it is degenerating public transport and responsible for the diminishing state of the network and safety .
On the other hand , the debate on Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot be one-sided .
This risk must be addressed effectively and , as we recall , tragic incidents in Japan , as a matter of urgency .
The main objective of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risks they face being injured by a bloody or vicious subject used in medicine .
In short , I may conclude my report this evening , but the work is by no means finished , either for me or for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and I would like to stress that my own week had - straight away - great reservations about the adoption of SIS II , because of the many implications for data protection .
There must be the right conditions .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman registered 3 098 complaints , compared with 3 406 in 2008 , which is 9 % down .
The European Court of Justice also expressly rejected the mandatory retirement age at the retirement age in its ruling in October .
There is still considerable potential for the exploitation of EGNOSS and GNSS in the areas of safety , the environment and the smooth operation of road transport , as these can be used to collect tolls .
The cohesion sector , which represents nearly one third of the budget , is still the only budget area where the estimated level of error exceeds 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for having submitted reports which have received the support of the majority .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposed way out of the crisis in the green economy , energy , broadband networks and innovation are aimed at extending capital to new profitable sectors rather than at protecting the environment and satisfying grassroots requirements .
I therefore share the concern that you expressed that the objectives of the Hungarian Presidency may be distorted by national debates or specialities rather than being achieved thanks to what unites us .
I agree with the attendant expenditure on the basis of prior consent to justified and precisely defined cases when cross-border healthcare includes patient stay in hospital for at least one slow and requires highly qualified medical equipment and costs , or when there is a significant risk to the patient or the general population .
The most important way to lead would be , and still is , to pursue , a more stringent emissions reduction target of at least 30 % .
The abuse is damaging , in particular , to the factors that are making frank efforts to reduce environmental disasters .
Previously scandals of illegal visas show how lax some states are taking on the issue of issuing visas .
The poor population of rural areas , which is most in need of funding , is once again left to its own destiny .
I know that you have the skills to meet these challenges .
- Mr President of the Czech Republic , I warmly welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orbán was not recommended to the groups in the European Parliament as the European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; adopting populist and nationalist tone , &apos; protecting the Hungarian people &apos; from &apos; attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I welcome the report and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s aid to persuade Iran not to create nuclear bombs .
I am totally opposed to the US idea of preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for stability in Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is an important piece of work that enables us to define a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
In this context , we are committed to defining the conditions under which the fisheries sector will become truly sustainable and will be able to develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic region are tough , but there is also no doubt that , with new technologies and technological advances , the region will inevitably open up for greater exploitation of its natural resources , with fishing being an arduous example .
The youth unemployment rate reached 20 % at the beginning of the year , due to the economic crisis , while the school dropout rate reached 17 % , with young people in rural areas mainly being affected by this .
Today , we are faced with a broad spread on the market for environmental labels , pictures , pictures , which may cause confusion to the consumer ; from the images of forests to containing dangerous substances , to the claims of a neutral balance of carbon emissions or even green cars .
We opposed this proposal because it seemed that it is placing the responsibility on European countries for the plight of the underdeveloped Third World , rather than blaming them .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise that as a result of my speech , I deprive you all of time and I am delaying you for today &apos;s lunch but this opportunity is given me every 10 years so it may not bother you so barely .
It is a sensitive task , it is a position that requires change for the better and it simply does not have the right experience .
Only last year we agreed to waive these rules and , unlike consumers , our producers found and are still seeing a difference .
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only about austerity and about limiting the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) budget to be cut , because this would mean that agriculture would probably be less deserving of Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of such a huge installation , which is provided for in economic calculations , entails huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction at the negotiation of the compromise proposal .
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , you owe Valdis Zatlers , it is a great pleasure for all of us to welcome you here today on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the drama unfolded .
When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration can be passed and there is a readmission agreement - which is the objective - and therefore , the European Union &apos;s agreements with this third country have been strengthened - which is the holistic approach and philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration - what is happening is that the borders of the Member States of the Union are strengthened .
We regret that the report does not fully include our proposal , but we welcome the fact that it is drawing a conclusion that is close to our very close .
Given that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an open world trade environment is one of the tasks entrusted by President Barroso to the new Agriculture Commissioner , I would like to take advantage of the Commissioner &apos;s presence in this Chamber to ask him how he sees cooperation with his colleague , agricultural authority , in terms of concluding the negotiations in the context of the Doha Round .
This report proposes simplifying budgetary surveillance and control and strengthening the technical and scientific peer evaluation based on excellence .
The proposals put forward here today need to be examined , analysed and understood in this light .
It is also necessary to highlight legal and administrative obstacles ( legal subjectivity , financing rules and also , in some cases , intellectual property ) , which may prevent the participation of a large number of important research players and small and medium-sized enterprises .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will review Directive 2007 / 52 in the light of the aspects it has just listed .
That is why I also voted for the provisions emphasising corporate social responsibility .
We see that , with regard to the new point we have developed together , in other words , the issue of transparency , the progress that has been made rather slow and , in fact , with the new regulations on access to documents , the opportunity for those who conduct infringement proceedings , those who are calling for such a procedure to be initiated or who are trying to understand why an infringement affair has been initiated or closed , is reduced on the basis of any criterion .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that in this building which , unfortunately , is always half empty at the moment , is not the first time that we have discussed the terrible human rights situation in Burma .
The task of society is therefore to take steps to allow women and men a free choice between the two rational alternatives , each of which has reason to exist when they are seen in the light of a wider perspective rather than this work .
Today it is promoting the consumption of products of reduced value , leaving six thousand farmers who cannot afford to put their production into a country that produces 50 % of its needs .
We are not yet able to see clearly all the effects of the current situation on our portfolio and on the course of our business .
In the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is very important today - perhaps more important than ever .
Fossil fuels create a central , hierarchy and nonsensical energy distribution .
In this context , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU has already spent half its term of office , so it is worth reviewing its achievements so far .
I believe that the review of the first railway package should highlight the problems faced by Member States which have received reasoned opinions from the Commission , along with a method of resolving them .
Israel does not realise that such an extensive military response is an opportunity for possible new suicide bombers and the displacement of new rockets at the earliest possible opportunity .
The Burmese authorities have chosen to ignore the protests against the prison of Aung San Suu Kyi and the calls for her release from many countries and organisations , including the United Nations Secretary-General , the Secretary-General of ASEAN and the series of ASEAN Member States , where ultimately Burma belongs .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , has told us that the guarantees in the EU budget for the EIB &apos;s activities amounted to approximately EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , an important amount even for the EU , and Parliament is therefore entitled , in my view , to demand that the risks associated with this obligation be explained .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved the work , but I would now like both personally and on behalf of Timo Soini to find the information relating to the work that the citizens of all the Baltic States need before the construction of the work begins .
Without the active involvement of the Czech Presidency , this decision would not have been made .
I believe that holding an information campaign on this is essential .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has failed to control the identity documents held by citizens from Kosovo .
Measures have been taken and clear and precise rules have also been established in this area .
Does he support the vision proposed by Mr Corbett for the federal United States of Europe , prefers a more relaxed vision for a Europe of free trade , as my party proposes ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report she is presenting today .

It is rare for people to come together with so many qualifications .
I firmly believe that everyone in Slovenia will agree to carry out an immediate stress test in Krško .
It does not bode well that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit on Thursday .
We have already seen significant progress in meeting the criteria , and we ask the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet the requirements as soon as possible .
In circumstances such as these , allowing the Moldovan Government to oblige its population to finance such uncertain European programmes and organisations as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the SESAR Research Programme , while Moldova is not a member of the European Union , is rather a sign of cynicism .
This means simultaneously solving the problems , since this infrastructure can stimulate the European economy and provide jobs while , at the same time , mitigating the consequences of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Khanty-Mansisk it was agreed that our common objective is to conclude a strategic agreement , which will provide an overall framework for EU-Russia relations in the near future and contribute to the development of the potential of our relationship .
It is now clear that we are lagging behind the demands for affairs in the Mediterranean region and in Libya in particular ; we need to think a little bit more about recognising that we perhaps need more vigorous actions to understand what is happening and also to develop coordinated action in the Mediterranean .
The substantial funding by Europe for this line was conditional on the support of the plan for local populations and on private Italian investment .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , the reports on the accession process in the Balkan States were published .
We therefore abstained from voting on the proposals from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on issues relating to the TV1 scandal in Portugal , despite the fact that the Portuguese Communist Party is known to denounce the current situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed a country reference regime so that transnational businesses should report country-by-country reporting .
One key issue mentioned in the report is the problem of prostitution and the trafficking of women .

I endorsed the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , in terms of integration , even with the arrest and trial of Mladić and Hadžić , the work of the Court will not be completed .
In addition , I call on the Commission to support the requests for compensation made against responsible companies on the part of deceived farmers who , in their turn , poisoned their own animals .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative on the use of information and communication technologies ( ICT ) in order to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to be able to find solutions , we must use the same approach in the future .
You know that our message is structural reforms ; structural reforms to increase Europe &apos;s development potential and its ability to create jobs are indispensable .
Particularly during the current global financial crisis , this partnership may prove to be of the utmost importance and create greater opportunities for trade , scientific and technological exchanges , enabling us to emerge from this crisis with stronger , more stable positions .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
The adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament increased powers , with the administrative burden that it entails .
At a time of unprecedented crisis , when hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost , everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed or poor workers does not reach 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like once again to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed together with four other Members , and which half of the Members of the European Parliament have adopted , plus one , with the aim of committing the Council and the Commission to legislation that is genuinely effective in combating corruption .
Mr President , Presidents of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully agrees with your programme for Parliament and Parliament &apos;s operation over the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let them fulfil these promises !
We believe that this is exactly the kind of dialogue that will enable us to help these countries , particularly by strengthening the involvement of civil society .
Although as a socialist I believe that the rebel under the current circumstances in Sri Lanka will not lead to a solution , the Tamil does indeed have the right to self-defence in the face of military repression .
It is time to support simpler , less costly measures for SMEs , which naturally lead to more jobs and more growth .
To combat this phenomenon it is very important that we accept uniform safety measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
When we talk about collective claims , the issue of the US and its experiences and extreme repression always arises .
The immediate application of EU-US agreements on surrender and judicial assistance would stimulate criminal cooperation and would eliminate the grey zone that made it possible to fly exceptional delivery .
Colleagues , Commissioner , I have three proposals and I would very much like to ask for the support of these proposals .
Already , the Court of Justice of the European Union has been called upon several times to determine - in specific cases - whether or not a sporting activity is an agency for purely common benefit , or whether , on the contrary , there are also economic aspects involved in a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is one of Parliament &apos;s biggest priorities , and citizens should be aware of that .
Only time will show whether this is a marginalised issue or whether the undeniable positive effects of the directive will prevail .
With the modernisation of freight transport logistics and the promotion of co-modality , that is , the combination of various modes of transport within the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase prosperity in the Baltic region .
It should be up to the Member States to decide , in democratic terms , whether or not they wish to ratify this ILO Convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income was between EUR 123 and EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text adopted ultimately is not so good .
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment on many sides .
If the bill is passed , we call on the international donors , both governmental and non-governmental , to cease their activities in certain areas .
This lack hampers the legal protection of civil rights and is an aspect that needs to be reopened .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe is our home country .
Therefore , if I speak Hungarian to a police officer in Slovakia , he is obliged to answer me in Slovak , even if Hungarian is his mother tongue , and irrespective of the fact that I do not understand his answer .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to speak again on one of the aspects of transatlantic cooperation in the area of policing and justice relating to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , in other words , the transfer of bank information from SWIFT to the United States .
In 2009 , there was a worrying increase in the various forms of national protection used , both in individual Member States of the European Union and in new developing economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency was not taken seriously - either by the Commission or by the Council .
Finally , on the political front , it is important to have an alliance with the ACP States within the World Trade Organisation .
We have to do something else .
If we succeed in helping to find an orphan child together and a family that is yearn to have children , we will have made a very important contribution .
As an important step for the success of the 2020 strategy , I would like to speak specifically about how important it is to stop the various EU institutions from competing with each other and working together seriously on the instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
The acute events in Gaza must also encourage us to look to Gaza with a strategic and long-term glance .

Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions pursuing the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , this vote tomorrow is , to a large extent , a vote on the European Parliament &apos;s position .
In a turbulent global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union must strengthen its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , promote its interests and protect its citizens , developing a common vision of its main challenges and threats and bringing its potential and resources into line in such a way as to adequately respond to them , thus contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
This is a good moment in relations between the two sides and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This register will be a step towards greater transparency of the European institutions , and I hope it will contribute to the legitimacy of the European project towards the citizens of Europe .
I suggest that you look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for an active approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on the strengthening of surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
However , if we want to tackle this problem successfully , we also need to support it with strong and determined political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , I say to you for the last time .
I would like exceptions to be granted either by a clear time limit or by clear benchmarks , however structured - the Commission could perhaps consider what proposals it intends to put on the table to meet partly India &apos;s requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate , I have heard an account of the Italian Prime Minister almost everything possible except the fact that , thanks to his business activities , he has been doing a job for tens of thousands of people .
If the moment is the right one , it is , of course , one issue that Parliament should address itself .
This report therefore emphasises the importance of an unknown programme , while calling for changes : to amend excessively burdensome administrative and budgetary regulations and the low rate of success , which still make this programme particularly prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , at a time when it plays an important role in transforming research into products and services ; ensuring better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders in a period of research still shared national research .
The problem is that the ECB is not independent in the case of the Greek crisis ; it has chosen a &apos; camp &apos; .
It will not make our industries uncompetitive .
He called for a global ban on body scanners .
The statistics show that , every year , cardiovascular diseases are the cause of around 4.3 million deaths in Europe and more than 1.7 million people die of cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective measure of public health to protect Europeans from contagious diseases , but it is also important that healthcare also reaches developing countries to help increase life expectancy and combat poverty .
And therefore , we have to say that the exploitation of the new rules by the banks which have entered the euro area in order to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens is apparent solvency .
We absolutely must ensure in the context of this economic situation and , moreover , here in the European Parliament that costs are checked .
I therefore believe that enhanced protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
It played a very important role because it has been an observer in all trials before the Supreme State Security Court and has carried out regular evaluations of the detention conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
It seemed then that each of the new Member States would observe the EU &apos;s basic principles and respect non-discrimination , but it would also protect and appreciate the linguistic diversity and rights of national minorities .
Not only have the financial appropriations diminished , but also the social appropriations .
These new measures could make it possible to help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights , particularly with regard to the recognition of their qualifications and social rights , as well as residence rights .
This issue of the mutual recognition of qualifications is not resolved in one day &apos;s time .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment with the aim of preparing , if relevant , an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
It is a fact that men are entitled to full participation in caring for their child in the first few days after arrival in the family .
These intentions deserve our appreciation and should not be criticised , although this is not the key issue in this case .
The reality is that we in the EU must abolish our exclusive dependence on Russian energy supply .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is today the 111th largest trading partner of the European Union and trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounted for by 1.6 % of all EU external trade in 2010 .
I would first like to clarify that the rapporteur who introduced this into our Rules of Procedure was Marylène Renault , not me .
The domestic fisheries sector remains completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing with four reports here today , so I will start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and also the European Commission for its cooperation .
With regard to the summit , I very much agree that this is an important fact .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which will be applicable - and I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - in a uniform and unbureaucratic way throughout the EU , without affecting existing cooperation between Member States in accordance with Article 306 of the Treaty .
The Dalai Lama , on the contrary , said that the representatives of China are welcome to study the documents on his exile government &apos;s records to make sure that he had not thrown away violence .
They are their response to the issue that has delayed their development and integration into the international world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day in the media , but also here in Parliament , we receive numerous demagogical claims that have no professional basis whatsoever .
Given that human rights are a key element in the agreement that commits the EU and Pakistan , the autonomous trade preferences proposed must be dependent on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive , because it should have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it directly affects the buildings in which they live and which they use .
Amendment 9 introduces the unacceptable position on derogations , albeit transitional , from the principles underpinning the European Union , including the four fundamental freedoms .
But we do not agree that it is acceptable for this House to see it as a reason to demand an increase in the budget .
The time has finally come for an end to this one-sided advantage enjoyed by the US .
Commissioner Dalli and honourable Members of the Commission , now that this directive exists , I would be pleased if you were more focused on the regulation on social security , which is the system on which everything is based and makes it clear who is paid and where the situation is well organised .
We must never forget our common objective , and we must work with the Arctic states and with the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
I think it was absolutely necessary and it is a clear indication of the achievement of this Parliament when it comes to the drafting of the budget , using resources - let me put it so - that were not used in other areas .
Let us now look at the cases .
In order to do this , every effort will be required to reduce the energy intensity of the economy in all areas .
In sensitive sectors such as clothing , skin and furniture products , for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe , ensuring European knowledge and European jobs , it is very important to create the conditions for a conscious choice .
Although violence against women has been under discussion for several decades now , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proved an effective foreign policy instrument , promoting the strengthening of relations with third countries , with certain tangible results .
This is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission not only has the right , but also the duty , to express its opinion .
However , with the proposal document , we have dismantled the obstacles and we have achieved it because of the need to care for patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of these proposals and the urgency of their nature .
I believe that every patient has the right to quality care and care given in his own language , close to his or her home family and his family .
We have to speak in this Chamber on the terms that we have all accepted , and FYROM , the country that is accession , we have accepted it as &apos; FYROM &apos; rather than as Macedonia &apos; .
This is possible and can lead to better results .
The latest developments in the European economy , and particularly in relation to Greece , have shown that there is a pressing and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
In order not to win their doctrine , Stuart Wheeler , said that it costs GBP 120 billion a year , about 36 times the real figure .
This dual approach to Belarus - the &apos; stick and carrot &apos; approach , as I think Mr Tannockle called it - is hopefully an approach that he will achieve .
We could talk about hours about many other issues - the energy of non-proliferation or whatever you can think , but I think it is important that we have this agreement on these three reports that have been presented today on what we have done in the last period .
Secondly , it has also said that the Commission should start thinking about eurobonds - finally , let me say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
That is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
According to this regulation , tyre manufacturers must use labels and labels to provide users with information on fuel consumption and rolling resistance , wet grip grip rates and external noise .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon or not .
In this effort to achieve more bold and ambitious results , I also believe that in the final phase of the COP 16 negotiations , the European Union must make its main negotiator available a margin of flexibility to enable it to react accordingly to developments .
A balanced and transparent measure is therefore necessary , given that the confidence of our entrepreneurs is a precondition for the project &apos;s success .
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of environmentally destructive urbanisation , in particular in coastal areas and in Spain &apos;s islands , but also in other regions like around Madrid .
It is important that the special representative for Central Asia closely monitor the situation , in close cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
These procedures must include the necessary maintenance and surveillance following the closure , treatment and decontamination of waste , environmental upgrading of facilities , and support for replacing the production capacity of the plants to be closed , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is what I believe .
I come from a country where , whenever I go to the supermarket , I see a man on a poll on a poll of a bicycle with a wood back .
The market itself is a very interesting topic to be debated and I think it is also an issue on which we can arrive at some sort of common understanding .
However , without a pan-European network , there will be no key objectives of the European Union .
In Europe tobacco is grown in 17 out of the 27 Member States , and in all cases , subsidies are granted by national governments .
One of the three - English , French or German - will be used to guarantee legal protection automatically across the EU .
This issue is a very controversial one in Ireland and it gives those who are advocating &apos; no &apos; to the Lisbon Treaty referendum .
The Presidency has made every effort to reach an agreement , but it was finally decided that on this issue it should be the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that sometimes we have differences of opinion .

However , this may have been isolated incidents linked to transit in the organisation &apos;s long and long duration building .
The proposed amendments will enable the less developed Member States , including Romania , to be eligible for this fund .
The next item is voting time .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging that so many Members from all sides of the Chamber are quite rightly praising the Belgian Presidency .
It is unnecessary to highlight the importance of these two points in the current situation .
Together , we will work towards concluding the Doha Round with a positive outcome in 2010 , as this is of paramount importance to the efforts made to promote recovery and to combat protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a special day for me because , after ten years of good and loyal service , that was my last sitting as President here in Brussels .
In terms of efficiency , I also consider it an interesting idea for these delegations to take on some consular tasks , such as the management of Schengen visas .
It seems that we have spent so long on a daily basis discussing each other rather than talking to others and we have ended up being defeated by a state .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos;s plan needs more work and Parliament will therefore take more time to decide .
Perhaps there are plans to go further than what has been proposed to date .
All Member States would be in a much more difficult situation without the European Union and its protective shield .
Like a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in universal primary education , poverty reduction and access to safe drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso , with the Treaty of Lisbon in hand , said that it is the Commission that is speaking on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
There can be views and even disagreements and even Eurosceptics are allowed , but the end result must be the same .
Lukashenko , who is an intelligent political player , has managed to exploit his election programme , has gained all political and economic benefits and , at the same time , has continued to show contempt for democracy and human rights .
According to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude local cross-border traffic agreements between Russia and the neighbouring Member States of the European Union which might be interested in this .
This is crucial for the future wellbeing of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself have spoken about gaps in the implementation of our legislation in many Member States that need to be filled .
We must treat these people as free citizens and respectfully .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of Southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure that they are recycled correctly , not only to prevent environmental and health harm , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot but remind you that , at the expense of Omar al-Bashir , there is still an international arrest warrant left , which the authorities in that country are ignoring .
In addition , President Barroso sent a written letter to Parliament &apos;s Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs , Mr Gargani , in which the pilot project &apos;s findings are analysed in detail and in the same letter , the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of the programme and preparatory work has already begun .
Mr President , I would expect you to respond to this by revoking order .
With regard to the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is right in essence to the extent that it tackles the issue of the prohibition and gradual replacement of products which have a serious harmful effect on human health .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to define the fishing opportunities of European Union vessels based on the additional reserves available , as well as the financial contribution paid separately for access rights and sectoral support .
We in the EU must offer the new Tunisian national unity government every assistance and also provide all assistance to EU citizens , including British citizens , who had visited Tunisia for holidays and have been left in the lurch .
Fellow Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and proper for the island of Taiwan to be transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional means of communication often fail because of commercial interests or because their administration belongs to a specific political space and indirectly obliges officials to be sessed in their own right .
We cannot coexist in the European Union while continuing this situation and we therefore believe that it is very important that the Commission , the European Union authorities and all of us make proposals that are moving in the same spirit to put an end to this situation .
This is one issue , and I also intend to follow various social , environmental and economic criteria because I am committed to evaluating all the legislation in advance .
That is why I voted in favour of the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Fund .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner Georgieva , it is very good that we are discussing Belarus here in the European Parliament , but the debate is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support the proposal and defend it .
Furthermore , I am pleased that East Jerusalem is considered as the capital of the future Palestinian state or Jerusalem as the capital of the two states .
The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must equip itself appropriately .
However , there are significant differences between regions of the same Member State .
The prevention and elimination of violence against women are major strategic objectives that are important for the progress that our civilisation is fighting for .
I await your answers .
The preliminary results of the referendum on 10 southern provinces were announced on 30 January and demonstrated that the vast majority of the population ( 9.5 % ) is in favour of secession .
I personally feel that Europe needs a single energy policy so that excessive dependency on sources is avoided from an individual area .
The FVO has also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and identified problems on many load when they were transferred to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates .
These committees will now take the floor in turn .
That is why I think the most important question now is how and what we can then add to the achievements of the Swedish Presidency .
The role of the European Union must be strengthened after the current crisis .
Central part of this proposal is the emphasis that dialogue is mutual , that opinions expressed must be taken seriously and are respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore Polish names of streets and cities in the regions where most residents belong to the Polish minority .
Given that all these actions are interconnected , necessary and consistent with the size of the ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result as quickly as possible in accordance with the expectations of the citizens .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it represents a significant improvement in relation to the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour .
The aim of this report is greater tolerance of the risks , simplification of bureaucratic monitoring mechanisms and building greater confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I endorse the comments made by Mr Daul .
The resolution adopted today points out that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest possible participation of various categories of factors , while respecting their different identity .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has been very concerned with the images we have faced in recent weeks in the Mediterranean region , where many people , in their attempt to escape from the situation in Africa , have arrived in Europe , while others have also failed to reach their destination .
Nevertheless , none of this is currently happening , and the situation in Lampedusa is a sad example here .
Israel bombs and loses a ghettom .
It is important to listen to the views of the citizens , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the CFP and of global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
We need to develop a partnership based on respect for one another , on our common commitments , as well as on the values embraced by the European Union with regard to human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this context , we , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , have tabled an amendment calling - not just in relation to Europe , of course , also for the United States , as the Commissioner knows very well - for the complete abolition of all forms of export subsidies , and quickly .
Most emphasise the need to switch or focus the CAP on the competitiveness of European agriculture , to respond to climate change , to food security and to the requirements of quality and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations regarding the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit , which is due to take place in May .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Of course , it is extremely important for the European Union to increase specific subsidies to cities , because this is where the major potential of the economy and of the finances lies , because cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will be presented formally to the Committee on Budgetary Control next week .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , according to scientists &apos; proposals , we need significant financial resources .
Only the carrot and wolf that are the principal potential of the accession process can make the governments of these countries concentrate on making the work and reforms which , once and for all , can consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will focus my attention on two reports , in view of their particular importance .
For the sake of the legal security of all those involved , those accused of committing offences should have the same rights throughout Europe and there should be mandatory information regarding these rights .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy fall within national sovereignty , which is why we voted against all the reports on this issue .
I refer to Article d by referring to Mr Weber .
I also appreciated the positive assessment of the proposal regarding Macedonia &apos;s continued efforts to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened just a few hours ago in Greece will not be contagious , and I hope that , on the contrary , it signals the start of a unanimous effort to create European identity through solidarity and cooperation .
We are in constant contact with those in Tunisia and with the people in Egypt , with our delegations , to whom I pay tribute for what they had to deal with in the last two weeks , as well as direct contact with the government and services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument is all the more important in the light of the financial crisis , because it can help businesses to recover more effectively , and in future it will not be a pilot project for creating a more generous energy fund .
Those controls were insufficient .
We will then be able to make a major contribution from Europe , but this cannot be unlimited .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman following his draft recommendation to the European Commission in Complaint 676 / 2008RT , which concerns the Commission &apos;s excessive delay in providing responses to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
The main progress made by this directive , in relation to existing legislation , is that patients will be able to choose a healthcare provider and will have access to information about the quality and safety of the care they are going to receive .
I would like to reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in a flexible way , as well as on the review of the regional programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund with a view to adapting them to the requirements arising from the tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer rights organisations and representatives of the business world , I understand that we need to insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I have said that any questions are &apos; bad &apos; in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to follow the negotiations - in this case , the trade negotiations - and to intervene politically using the parliamentary instruments at its disposal , such as the hearings , resolutions and oral questions , in order to inform itself about the progress of these negotiations .
There is no recognition of citizens &apos; investment in social cohesion or inter-generational solidarity .
The real reform , however , relates to admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union today .
For this reason , appropriate financial resources must be made available to allow opportunities and new sources of global competitiveness to be exploited by the EU .
In many countries in Europe , when public authorities are in a difficult situation , it is known that they are generally delaying payments and very often causing the bankruptcy of certain companies .
The G20 Summit also set itself the main objective of abolishing economic havens .
There is no response to this from the political class .
Of course , the dollar remains the main king of global trade , still providing a secure investment , but the chicking of the United States has grown debt to make the rest of the world finance their way of life increasingly , will bring resources of doubt to its ability to meet its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures to fight , and to disgrace those who want to destroy it .
For that reason , Iceland , when it was a rich country , was not interested in joining the European Union at all .
That is not a new request , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method of promoting sustainable development and universal involvement in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance .
However , it is a problem that will export the fight against international terrorism to neighbouring countries and regions for as long as the war in Afghanistan continues .
We need to combat fragmentation trends , so I appeal to Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund in full in the regulations he will propose , and not to divert it as it is sometimes proposed in this House .
Of course , it is only natural that we do not achieve all of our desired objectives in a compromise .
I would finally like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure , as well as the rapporteurs , Mr László Surján , Mr Vladimír Maňka and Mrs Jutta Haug , for their constructive attitude during this process , point of the excellent cooperation we have achieved .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Socialist Democratic Group cannot remain indifferent in the face of the recent killings of human rights defenders in Russia .
It would be better to point out that the negotiations are not open to zero , which would pave the way for more realistic alternatives like , for example , a preferential partnership regime .
So it is primarily an American problem that needs to be resolved by Washington .
Let me also say that we should carry out a reform that makes European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers , and creates a dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The quotas they buy can be kept in the national reserve and distributed later on if they want to be distributed by the Member States .
I therefore appeal , on 25 May , on the day of his execution , to be appointed as International Day for the Victims of Fight Against Totalitarianism , as many unknown people , who lost their lives like Pilecki in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to always exist in our memory .
Let me briefly mention what we have done .
If this were to take the prevailing view in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the peace plan created following the Balkan wars and which has been seriously subsidised .
I hope that all this will encourage people to join the eco-management and audit scheme , not because I want to play by the figures and make EMAS a competitive ISO , but because I think that this system is a good one and it will help us to comply with the sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker replies to the question put by Mr Cristian Dan Preda under the blue card procedure under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important and I think it will go well .
We must not allow currency dumping to continue and the social consequences that this entails to continue .
This dimension is vital for ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
By identifying best practice from the experience of Member States and meeting basic standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equitable treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we will have the foundations for a coherent European policy on the subject .
I know that during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , interest circles in the sheep sector argued for mandatory origin labelling .
I am fully aware of the complexity of this issue , Mr Kelly .
Although most countries are facing many economic and financial problems , our attention must be focused on suspending the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debates on the reform of the own resources system .
Therefore , total eligibility for these measures has increased .
The Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to express its opinion on the audit process .
The rates of fraud in France and Spain are regarded as &apos; suspected low &apos; , for example .
In 2005 the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in the solutions and whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to set up a network of exchange of statistical data , through Member States , and a platform for coordinating research into the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view that many people in this House have expressed that the more European solidarity we have the better Europe and Russia relations will be .
Syria has a long way to go in terms of freedom of speech and association .
Much remains to be done to enable women to have fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal must be reassessed in order to take account of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is not a sustainable one .
I supported the report because I wanted , in particular , to point out one particular threat to it : the lack of proper and wide-ranging information for consumers concerning the properties of health , composition and origin of specific species of fish .
At the end of the day , history is full of examples of interventions on the part of Western countries that have done more harm than good .
Speaking as rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is extremely ineffective and lacking in responding for many reasons to the requirements of combating crime .
This Palestinian agreement is a crucial political event and , unlike what has just been said here , Hamas has agreed for the first time to be the OAS and its Palestinian partner in the negotiations .
Countries object to and negotiate ways of splitting the seabed .
The last area is particularly important , knowing the energy infrastructure problems that ...
In other words , the organisation itself established to protect us from criminals ( indirectly , offering professional training to police officers ) ends up becoming accused .
However , the handover of power by Fidel Castro on his brother , Raúl , has led neither to democratic reforms nor to the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency differences should also feature in all advertisements containing information about energy consumption or related to product prices .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know the &apos; Washington consensus &apos; : you love it .
In this way , we could also respond appropriately to the real events that Frontex is already facing .
I would like to end by once again thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs but also the members of the various committees who have been involved for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this issue , and I appreciate the support of the Presidency in our efforts to find a sustainable solution .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s long experience on the private sector &apos;s business fabric makes it absolutely appropriate for a balance to be struck between EU law and Europe &apos;s peoples &apos; specific requirements .
To date , this conflict has removed 1 000 lives in 17 days .
The figures of falsified medicines will be reduced and their use will only be safer if such measures are taken .
We must also learn from the Opel case : it is not yet too late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the car industry .
We have done these things because , like you , President Obama and I reject the false choice between our security and our ideals .
The Pact for the euro unfortunately proposes to make austerity a permanent feature .
Recently , a new test was started at Manchester airport and now the legal advice was given that the use of these devices in minors may , because of the nature of their image , constitute a violation of children &apos;s safety legislation and protection .
That being said , this money is not going directly to artists .
In the area of civil aviation , the development of the system and the use of EGNOS for catering oligarchies must be supported .
Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime authorities ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) - Common vessel collection and survey of ships by the port state ( recast ) - Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - Investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - Intelligent Transport requirements - Regulators in the case of passengers in distress - Regulations ( debate )
I am voting in favour of the report on the creation of a new microfinance facility to help people whose jobs are at risk of setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important to make some progress in this regard with Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , with which I fully agree , and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes , as operational programmes capable of providing new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , it became clear that the improvements I proposed on behalf of this House are necessary to create fair and efficient energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is of paramount importance that self-employed people be supported and encouraged .
In short , there is no need to demand Brussels .
Mr President , it is clear to us and to Europe , for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and us in Europe , that energy has become a foreign policy tool , an element of change , which may cause conflict or unite us , and that is exactly what we are concerned with today .
I voted in favour of the report because the food aid programme , which is being studied , is an important means of helping the most deprived persons , who find it very difficult to suit even in the current economic crisis to serve their basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including Member States of the European Union , have the least one export credit agency that is officially supported , and these organisations are all the most important global source of public financial support for private sector projects .
We are therefore not voting in favour of this report .
By taking this approach , we have helped to crush this joint government .
With the creation of the French Muslim Council in 2003 , the then Interior Secretary , Mr Sarkozy , introduced Islam into the institutions of France .
On this issue , I have already asked the European Commission to draft an opinion and consider developing specific programmes to create equal opportunities for women in the field of science .
This is a fight that we will continue to fight to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unlimited access to services by end-users .
Europe &apos;s large politicians and thinkers understood very well that the strength that Europe could unite was the common approach to economic problems .
The boundaries between freedom and security do not stop at the virtual world &apos;s limits .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , from this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the development strategy in key areas such as promoting the promotion of citizens , providing professional advice and employment .
The costs will be paid from the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular about what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to initiate dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is particularly important for the stability of the region .
We can therefore expect an accident to happen in reactor every 25 years .
In my opinion , this increased eligibility in the housing sector for costs cofinanced by the ERDF should lead us to think about other possible ways of development , in the medium and long term , whether in terms of eligibility for funding or matching the funds for certain strategic priorities .
Today is the time to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both these countries , this time against Christians .
Climate change : one of the greatest threats facing our planet .
Naturally , as expected , there has been a huge emphasis on human rights - on the importance of ensuring that these are clearly part of every dynamic relationship that we have and surrounded our work .
I must also say that the European Union currently has absolutely no jurisdiction over the regulation of air traffic .
However , Europe is not competent or cure for an economic crisis .
I therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment that the Commission has already made to comitology and optional provisions .
I do not believe that any of the fine words expressed here today , even those expressed by the Commission , can change the fact that the European Union has no presence in Libya and that , at the moment , it cannot even put an end to the crisis that exists in the cities or the actions of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s land forces .
That is why I firmly believe that if the European Parliament adopts these two regulations , it will certainly benefit EU citizens by giving them a greater choice .
( EL ) Mr President , I share the hope that measures will be taken at the European Council to reassure the markets and to restore stability in the euro area , because this should be of benefit all of us , regardless of whether we are members of it or not .
Particularly vulnerable has proved to be the funding of pre-accession aid .
This is something we should be grateful for and happy .
We therefore call for an end to war and violence from all sides and we call on the EU to act accordingly .
The outside Europe faces the energy challenge head-on .
The indicator for measuring the energy performance of buildings must be included in the sale or tender announcements published in the media .
It is fundamental to encourage efforts aimed at increasing EU investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , incentives for the creation of alternative unconventional forms of energy at local level and improvements in the infrastructure capacity to facilitate the connection with new energy sources .
The well-developed infrastructure forms the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market , which then leads to increased internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider setting up , within the ENP , a rapid response tool for the timely and flexible response to political changes in partner countries , as was recently the case in the southern neighbourhood .
I believe that if someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission it is simply groundless .
The problem is therefore that the only Members listening to you are those who know the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency has emphasised issues that concern our fellow citizens , our electorate , namely environmental and climate change , the financial crisis , job protection and the fight against crime , because , in order to do the right job , we have to be in harmonious terms with those who voted for us .
The EU budget cannot , as some MEPs say , be used as a supplement to national budgets in an austerity period , but should reflect the difficult situation that the EU Member States find themselves in .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty did not put any power to the Council to deal with the Member States &apos; national constitutions .
It is not a usual procedure .
You may call me cynical , but students do not always come to study and tourists do not always travel for a limited period of time .
Is the global financial crisis turning into an economic crisis , the cause of this situation , or are we facing , in this case , our own mistakes , our least and our lack of action ?
My second point &apos; but &apos; relates to the role played by the Belgian Presidency in the post-Lisbon era &apos; .
The primary objective of these regimes was , and is , to maintain the territorial integrity of this huge state , inhabited by a series of completely different peoples .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still facing its negative consequences .
This is about the situation with Japan in many sectors , but I do recognise Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect its own hidden market , to protect its own inland farmers , to pay its farmers higher than prices on global markets , and not to the massive imports that would suppress its agricultural population , as I acknowledge our own economies &apos; right to protect our own sectors .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to speak about two concepts , coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to work within the framework of this new strategy for strengthening social priority , as I have already mentioned to you in the debate on the broader political guidelines for the next term .
Therefore , Commissioner , I am going to get straight to this issue and ask you what measures - and I am using this astonishing - the Commission intends to take next period to address these shortcomings .
That is exactly what was missing until now or it has not been visible enough for citizens .
It does not care for the people , and it is quite right for them .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal by adopting by a very large majority Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report , which I thank , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania supported the open-door policy , which was specifically aimed at strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that , in addition to this , every effort must be made to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I also refer clearly not only to the labour accidents , which happen quite often , but also to dangerous substances used in work .
In September 2009 , the Council began a thorough examination of the proposal to amend the decision on the establishment of the European Refugee Fund .
At the moment , it is important to pay special attention to island and outermost regions which , in addition to their dense problems , are now faced with damaged infrastructure and individual , commercial and agricultural assets and , in many cases , are unable to return immediately to their usual activities , especially areas that are almost dependent on tourism , as images broadcast the media could potentially prevent them from operating .
We had such prolonged disturbance in the industry , with such huge financial losses , since 11 September , and , despite the economic difficulties that all Member States are currently facing , I would suggest that they support projects to support a sector that simply cannot afford any further losses .
At the same time , we have to acknowledge that our report is also growing at risk .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small bilingual and perhaps essential remark .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you may desperately want something to happen - but you have to see the reality .
Consumer organisations favour binding measures for a collective redress plan in all Member States , together with other options , such as the extension of existing alternative dispute settlement mechanisms to collective actions .
The problem is not the Turkish Cypriots , as some say .
I would like to ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their country of origin , without having to wait far from and tireless trips to the countries in which they will be consumed .
That is what we have to do .
I sincerely ask myself , ladies and gentlemen , where the human rights defenders , like us , have gone from here , when the West is secular and pluralistic , and who are shamefully turning their eyes away from a Middle East which , little or less , is reserved in just one religion .
This is what is happening at the moment , and we are in dialogue with the authorities of these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who are wasting our money are despicable , but Mr Schulz , politicians who are now increasing deficits and debts at the expense of the younger generations are just as irresponsible .
For this reason , I must thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs of the political groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights was satisfactory ; in fact , both sides have proved to be extremely cooperative .
We should try to ensure that the programmes offered provide the greatest possible support to the reforms being made in these countries in order to bring the Union closer together .
It is also very important for every Member State to maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information , namely on the availability of healthcare , procedures and the required documents .
In previous years , we have witnessed events in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , but now we are discussing trade in the context of absolute individual freedom .
Regardless of whether it is considered a private or public fund , this report concerns a very specific issue , namely , confirmation by Parliament , firstly , that it has no legal claim to subsidise its deficits and , secondly , that no such subsidy will take place .
Certainly , their &apos; faces &apos; are the most expensive after Helsinki of the amendment , which mobilised a thousand ships .
Strengthening competition disturbance is undermining the future of a European car industry and having negative consequences both for employment and technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think we should bear some things in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard many Members say that we want to see a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse vote mechanism .
( FR ) Having said that , I think it is very important to recall the real issues that are at stake here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
To show our solidarity with the campaign to end this barbaric ceremony , I recommend to all of you that you today be given a rocket as a symbol of our opposition to this practice .
Democratic control is being deported , as the most basic national governments are hiding behind the Commission and the Troika and the Commission is respectively referring to national governments .
Investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
This is unacceptable and , above all , it is not environmentally friendly .
It is obvious to those of us who are elected in rural constituencies and those who are involved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that today &apos;s position that many farmers are in is simply unbearable .
The savers deserve transparent information , which will be easily understandable and available .
I think we could help the Chinese people to have a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms when voting , because I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to improve fiscal stability in Europe and thus ensure our future .
It is equally important that the organisation of an initiative - social or non-governmental body - clearly identifies the scope and objective of the initiative , even though it is not obliged to submit a motion for a legislative resolution .
There is a city in Latvia , Daugavils , where more than 90 % of the population are Russian-speaking .
I would like here to welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apologies and also the recent motion for a resolution by the Czech Government , which asks for 31 December 2009 for the Health Minister to take a series of measures to ensure that such violations do not take place .
I supported the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity which has become the main benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
The consequences of globalisation have now been completely overtaken by the financial and economic crisis and our calculated response is to adapt the criteria for financing the EGF .
in writing . - ( PT ) This resolution refers to the declaration of independence of Kosovo on 17 February 2008 , recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to cooperate in their common approach to Kosovo , taking into account Kosovo &apos;s planned accession to the EU .
In comparison with both the other institutions , Parliament can be seen to be leading the issue of transparency yet , and so I would not make it my first priority , since , with regard both to document accessibility and to the transparency of the meetings and activities of the members of the European Parliament , we are more open than any national parliament .
It was a reaction aimed at the Italian Reform Minister , Umberto Bossi , to formulate domestic policy .
The warnings from Human Rights Watch to tomorrow - my region - and many other organisations must be taken seriously .
I voted in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution on the ban on pork and thrombin .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from voting and will follow closely the ongoing research .
Nevertheless , neither the European Commission &apos;s data is fully sufficient to define the measures to be used to punish Member States with the highest rate of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day on the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
In particular , improving the energy performance of buildings is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors outside the IACS ( ETS ) by 20 % .
Moving on to the second question , I can assure honourable Members that the Commission is aware that control of micro-resistance requires an interdisciplinary approach .
Yesterday &apos;s trialogue gives great hope for a definitive agreement .
Future forecasts based on the annual rate of increase of around 27 % in the coming years show that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that the text can take the form of a regulation rather than a Council decision .
Many people ask me what the initially ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because the EU &apos;s financial support will help people who have fallen victim to globalisation to find jobs and return to the labour market , thereby avoiding recession .
Given that the Internet is the main tool for creating better conditions and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms , particularly through broadcasting audiovisual material , I welcome the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in the spectrum and in creating software growth and innovation .
All of this also raises the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , as well as the problems caused by the accession of a country with a common border with more than 80 million inhabitants : all those are factors that continue to strengthen my firm conviction that it is not right to include Turkey in a Europe whose unity depends , above all , on the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Heckling in the gallery )
This means that we are against the environment and the safety of consumers , because old , fuel-intensive and potentially dangerous equipment will be redirected onto the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to listening to the debate .
I wanted to offer my thanks to the Governor of Balingen , Dr Reitemann , and the local council for allowing him to make the point at the price of these young men .
Thirdly , I would like to address one request to Mrs Kroes : to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we want to be proud in the future of this large flagship project .
Anyone who has lived and seen the effects of the environmental disaster caused by the weaknesses in technology in Baia Mare and the subsequent release of toxic cyanide waste with water flows , with far-reaching consequences on the Tisza River fauna pandemic in Hungary , as well as the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything possible to ensure that something similar never happens again in the European Union .
That is the responsibility of everyone : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In the future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return home and their possessions : the basic right of free movement , as you said , to cross dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which proposes rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we have found the courage to call this summit , that we have invited the social partners to join it , that we will prepare it with them in the long term - before the Employment Summit , there will be three rock table debates in Stockholm , Madrid and Act - and that we try to draw conclusions that will be helpful to the June Council .
The European Parliament has , in other words , put at first reading a solid foundation for the correct application of the rules on delivering cross-border healthcare in the Member States in such a way that patients , where necessary , and in accordance with the rules established and without the courts , receive the necessary treatment in external medical care or in another Member State .

Mr President , I have tabled an amendment on the need to implement this regulatory framework in the outermost regions as well .
Parliamentary immunity : see Minutes
That is the reality on which we all have to base our positions .

I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission .
The next item is the vote .
However , I would like to oppose the Reception Conditions Directive and the Dublin Regulation - and I seem to be the only one who is doing so in the discussions so far .
Parliament &apos;s adoption of this resolution on the conflict in Gaza is a positive step because it recognises Israel &apos;s violations of international law .
