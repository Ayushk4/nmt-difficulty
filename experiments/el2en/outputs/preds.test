What we need is to shape an approach in a spirit of solidarity among ourselves, a rather coordinated approach, rather than a kind of'each for himself' approach, and not to try to cut each other's federals.

These are not my words.

There was a problem with the appointment of 18 additional Members of this House, because some Member States had not actually planned a procedure, but we have decided that the most important issue is representativeness, that this is the principle that should guide us and that this House should have a balanced representation as soon as possible.

I believe that we can expect a multitude of initiatives calling on the Commission to take more action to call for more Europe and, without doubt, for the Commission to respond enthusiastically to this request.

However, I call as a form of primary prevention for the implementation of measures to encourage healthy ways of life, which are a fundamental factor in improving health.

It is true that lively debates have taken place in the Council as regards the best possible ways to ensure that the peripheral Member States do not feel excluded, and, in the end, there has been a qualified majority in the Council, and I hope that the same thing will happen - as revealed, in my view, by the debate - in Parliament.
43 should not result in the cancellation of Amendment 54, because in 54 there are other issues, which are not covered by 43.

I supported the rapporteur's proposals and the approach adopted in the Commission communication'Towards a Single Market Act', as well as the idea that an annual Single Market forum is essential.

I voted in favour of this report.
Report: Paolo Costa
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that, four years later, we have still not seen a proposal from the Commission on how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport.
in writing. - (IT) This report is the result of a compromise, since 1 625 amendments have been tabled on it, and it is divided into a number of key points covering the causes of the crisis, which range from property bubble to cannon banking products, lack of European tax harmonisation and non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.

I want to use a language that also reflects the positives of the European Union, because no matter how bizarre it seems, there are also positive things that have happened recently.
This is an important measure which supports families with children and allows them to reduce the unjust burden they are subject to.
We should welcome them enthusiastically rather than with little pride.
in writing. - (LV) In these days, Europe's farmers have been experiencing difficulties that we all have to overcome together to allow the livestock sector to develop and produce sufficient revenues for livestock farmers.
There is ambiguous language here, with EU control damaging the principle.
Revenue to the Treaty is currently being proposed - which has, in spite of everything, come into force with the prospect of lasting a whole generation - through a simplified procedure, in accordance with the major EU powers, in order to create a mechanism that is' fully in line', in their view,' with the policies [the International Monetary Fund]'.
Integrated work is of great importance to women, because it could significantly help to avoid unemployment or to better reconcile professional and family life.

This will make savings on companies whose products certified in one country will not have to be subjected to the entire certification process in another country.
We firmly believe that it is extremely important to work with India to bring about a successful outcome for the negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will allow both sides - the European Union and India - to emerge victors.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by the debate on behalf of my fellow Members who, on the one hand, are talking about simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but when it comes to taking the initial step for micro-entities - and that is only what we are talking about today, not any other test - they already have a tendency to say it again, not.

The fact is that the population of Europe is ageing is being claimed.
I believe that as Parliament, it is up to us to fight for stronger decisions in response to the problems that arise in Europe, while at the same time struggling to operate transparently in the management of the funds.
It is also absolutely absurd and unacceptable that MEPs are obliged to ask the Commission, behind closed doors, about the content of the agreements that we are about to vote on.
I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions, providing the incentives for compensating those affected and establishing the five-year period for exercising actions.
I agree with the positive assessment by the rapporteur of efforts to unify the management of budgetary and human resources, as well as improving the functionality and efficiency of internal control activities achieved in 2008.

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sánchez Presedo, on behalf of the Socialists and Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the liberals, who have worked with me very successfully on the compromise text presented today as a report on the Commission White Paper.
(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the extent to which this debate is of interest to those Members who have submitted the question is shown by the fact that none of them are any longer in the Chamber and so that they will have just heard what Inese Vaidere - that Russia's real visa policy was a weapon he used not to promote the naturalisation process in Latvia, but to do exactly the opposite.
However, I believe that the work we have done enables us to be optimistic.
In my opinion, the EU should duly assess this choice during the forthcoming dialogue managed by the High Representative.
(DE) Mr President, the debate reflects Europe's unresolved economic policy issues.
In addition, the Commission's control strategy for research has been designed to provide reasonable safeguards on the legality and lack of irregularities in research expenditure on a multiannual basis throughout the framework programme.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of children per year are victims of child traffickers and yet more are abducted.
Good governance and EU regional policy (
We should remember that GDP is a tool for measuring production and does not measure environmental sustainability, for example.
Cooperation of this kind facilitates the work of the rapporteur very much.

The truth is that the lofty human rights case has reached too many times low, with billionaire lawyers standing up in defence of false rights for terrorists, criminals and those who are victims.

Measures are needed to flourish late payment in commercial transactions, so as to protect the good health of the European economy and avoid situations where production structures are economic and are being over-indebted into financing products, thereby increasing dependency on the banking sector.

To conclude, we have enormous challenges to face to ensure unity at European level, to cooperate strategically with key external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate action, but there are many lessons that we can learn from the Fifth Conference of the Parties (COP 15).
It should therefore be based on real problems, ask questions like this and focus on specific measures which will provide added value to citizens' everyday lives.
Oral questions and written declarations (submission): see Minutes

That is one thing.
Another measure required is for India to draw up and apply some transparent and clear rules on public procurement, which will also enable European companies to access them.
Thus, with the appropriate impact assessment and the identification of the different legal possibilities, together with the clear definition of the objectives and funding of European infrastructure, it will be easier to achieve the long-term strategic plans to build a stronger EU.

Finally, Mr Mölzer, you are not so pessimistic, that is what I want to tell you.

Many pathologists are apparently starting to grant medicines against dementia too late in order not to go beyond their budget, and that is counterproductive.
Paradoxically, this instrument can be easily abused in practice, and not only by extremists, but also by very powerful interest groups, and I mention this because we consider the 1 00 000 declarations of support not much compared to the Union's demographic potential.
The 2010 budget imposes this systematic approach.
According to the report by the United Nations Working Group, the victims of human trafficking are from different social origins, from the weakest to the poorest, from the best educated to the completely broken, from young children to the elderly.
This is indeed a very important issue.
We need more and better European economic governance as regards the national measures to support this path, such as the tax on financial transactions, which I call on the Commission to consider very carefully, including in the European context.
I think that the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because it concerns not only healthcare but also therapy care, but we have a period in which this detail can be sorted out.
First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports, which raise important issues in terms of the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to achieving some of the key objectives of public policy: respect for human rights, the pursuit of economic prosperity and social justice, the achievement of sustainable development and respect for the environment, and the climate system in particular.
Consumers will be able to apply to several means in the event that they purchase a product that does not comply with the convention and that they will be entitled to claim compensation if remedy is not provided.
Mr President, the reason for urgency is the brutal killing of 57 people, who were accompanied by a politician who went to register as a candidate in the elections for the position of province governor.
This new intelligent, symmetric system will lead to supervision that will be stricter, in evaluations by the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, which will be more thorough, and to the drafting of recommendations concerning additional reforms and corrective plans.
The people of Syria deserve the long-awaited political reforms, especially those concerning freedom of expression, assembly and participation in politics and government.
Many of them were citizens of the United Kingdom who were trafficked within the country, so they had not been introduced from abroad, to use that expression.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has returned to growth rates in the third quarter of 2009, which could have made us believe that the worst go through.
In this context, it is expected that Greece should adopt a programme of thorough structural reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration, accelerating reform in the field of healthcare and pension system, improving the functioning of the labour market and the efficiency of the system of wage negotiations, improving the functioning of products and the business environment, as well as maintaining the stability of the banking and financial sector.
We believe that it is also important to mention the following when establishing agreements between sovereign countries: respect for the sovereignty of the country and its people, mutual interests, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account each country's particularities; an assessment of what each party contributes to the agreement from an economic, social and cultural point of view.
I believe that the transition to a sustainable, green economy will make progress even without imposing excessive legislative measures.
They are afraid to forget the contribution of the US and, of course, NATO to peace in Europe.
I believe that we need to see this as an appropriate opportunity to deal with what Europe desperately needs: economic growth, jobs, a small enterprise sector, more innovation, more efficient public procurement - these are the figures on which our citizens will judge us.
I think it is not our job to prejudge possible developments in these countries.
The second draft includes concessions.
Madam President, during the 2004 European elections, Ireland implemented a smoking ban in the workplace, with the result that we saw many outrageous voters outside restaurants and bars.
In fact, at a time of deep transformation in state action, increasing the EU budget is an act of confidence in the joint plan and strengthening action at supranational level.
I am sure our message deserves to be heard, so let us move to spread it.
This report contains guidelines for the way in which air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and procedures for approval.
The language law creates imbalance.
Perhaps, when the Treaty of Lisbon finally comes into force on 1 December, it will also be possible for British domestic policy to be left out of this Parliament.
That is the difference between the actual situation and the wishful thinking of the European Parliament.
In addition, we support the need for full participation of all national parliaments, in accordance with their budgetary and control rights, in order to increase transparency, ownership and accountability in all decisions taken, including at European level.
Mr President, five plus two questions have been asked about economic governance and Europe 2020.
That is why I believe that we must involve the national authorities, the European Commission and the Members of this Parliament actively in promoting SOLVIT.
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines and, now, Mr Michel, on protagonists and a liberal rhetoric that has led us to the current situation: promoting the agro-industrial model, bringing the interests of the large agro-food industry into line, and providing for the benefit of a qualitative decline in the global agricultural industry, and church of 70% of small and medium-sized holdings, and medium-sized enterprises.
Economically: the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs, and the CAP must ensure that this problem is resolved.
Again, I urge the Commission to press for this promise in its dealings with the government until it is recorded in Congolese legislation on a constant basis.
Mr President, I fully understand the considerable interest in the European Parliament in the actions taken at both Union and beyond to meet the challenges faced by some Member States in relation to their public finances.
We are positive about the will of the peoples who want better life, emancipation and a better tomorrow.
You have the support of the Irish People's Party (Christian Democrats) members.
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and, indeed, should follow up to make people more free, fairer and more social in the future.
It was my office that drafted the informal document on sanctions against Syria; we are in the position of the guide.
On the day on which we will be successfully freed, from poverty, the range of Communism will disappear forever.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the review of competition rules on horizontal cooperation - B7-0565/2010).
You have fought for this together, regardless of the colour, blue or orange.
I believe that this process, as well as the strengthening of food safety for European citizens, offers greater clarity for Member States and third countries exporting meat products to the EU.
In light of this, it seems reckless to be looking for an agreement with Mercosur, especially since the Swedish food and technology institute highlights that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef is perhaps 3.5 times higher than Ireland.
Thus, as agreed with the Council, the following text should be added to the end of Article 1 (4) of the original regulation, which is Article 1 (2) of the amending regulation:'The same reference trademarks are obtained as the basis for the annual review of the value of charges in Articles 4b, 463 (3) as long as these fees are in other currencies from the euro'.
Today the Irish Government has quite rightly called for European solidarity to be removed.
Just look at Ireland, a country which has come under a very serious blow from the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union has protected it from a crisis of even greater proportions.
It fears German properties for the Sudeten people and, having heard German politicians speak on this issue, I think he is absolutely right to be afraid.
an increase in support from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as enhanced financial support for technical actions related to the preparation and implementation of projects,
If we do not implement measures which will make countries realise that they will suffer serious consequences if they pursue economically absurd policies, we will not achieve anything.
We need to step up and promote further steps towards tackling climate change.
(Applause from the left)
As is always the case with such complicated issues, I have had an extraordinary cooperation with my group, Bernadette Vergnaud, Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle.
In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is indeed an important problem.
Similarly, it is a matter for each Member State to decide to sign and ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are the two primary instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.
It is therefore a structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange our views on issues.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, by providing protection and some support to people who are already in work so that they do not lose it and do not have to redistribute the cycle of retraining and upgrading their skills in one or two years' work; in order to maintain existing jobs;
Madam President, our questions are submitted with the intention of highlighting the benefits that our citizens can expect from such a package and what we can offer with a package of this kind.
I voted in favour of the report because it adds some substantial improvements to the European Commission's text, particularly on the issue of personal data protection.
In addition, we have been carrying out a review of the unused resources since 2009 so as to use a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and a supplementary EUR 420 million for broadband Internet services in category II.
Thank you very much for your proposal and your clear message.
We are also seeing elements of these reports here, as well as the attempt to adopt the holistic approach, which has not been as successful as we imagined, but which is, however, on the right path.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which has sometimes been a little oppressive, and the Council, where we tried to find sensible solutions to short meetings and many trialogues, because just one hour ago, they also adopted the sensible compromise that we proposed.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated action, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, established a European Permanent Coordination of Airlines, after the Transport Council meeting of 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself, in this case illegal logging, which creates the conditions for the trade in illegal timber.
I come from a country, Portugal, and a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and integrated into regions that are socially very fragile and where, in fact, it would be vital to keep the quota system after 2015.
People are not the product of specific cultures; these cultures are the result of certain peoples.
In some cases, it is so good that it should be taken into account.
(SV) Mr President, Iceland is a small country in population terms, with approximately 300 000 inhabitants, but it is a great nation.
Mr President, Members of the European Parliament have an important role to play in controlling decisions on health claims.
For this reason, we say an unequivocal'yes' to Nabucco, but as strongly as our decision is to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our population.
Political parties can be banned; there is corruption in the legal system; human rights are violated; freedom of speech and assembly does not exist in the same way as those in countries as Britain or the majority of other European states.
It is still very obvious why we need an energy mix consisting of various energy sources, to be as broadly as possible, because it will stabilise the energy situation and therefore diversify every nation, and Europe itself, will be recognised.
However, I really have doubts when Parliament invoked international law by condemning some disturbing practices, when the legal basis for this is not clear at all.
In voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I am clearly expressing my full support for the Tunisian people and the historic democratic revolution that it began.
Furthermore, it calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty and to report regularly on their actions with a view to tackling this concern.
If anyone is pressing for a law to be passed by the Hungarian Parliament and is legislating that from now on, it can only be revised by a two-thirds majority, you know that it will not be easy to review it again after the next elections.
Generalised tariff preferences (debate)
Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
The issue of new feeling of mutual trust is facing us with another major problem.
This year, we have made available to the EEAS an additional EUR 9.5 million, but it will be possible to estimate the exact costs following the first year in operation when the report will be presented to the European Parliament on all the costs associated with the work of the EEAS.
My question concerns Pakistan, whose chronic instability, as we all know, is a factor in the crisis for the whole region and Afghanistan.
Of course, we cannot forget the natural biological differences that exist between men and women.
Neither should these factors be forgotten, including in relation to the idea of the proposal concerning the allocation of revenue from infrastructure usage fees.
(HU) Mr President, what I welcome under this directive is the clear definition of patients' rights, the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution to the issue of non-availability of professionals in the patient's country.
Mr President, if I may, I would like to make a few comments on the issues and questions that have been raised.
Last week, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a presidency in the first place.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran, as I am concerned about the continued human rights violations in the country, particularly in relation to freedom of association, expression and information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.
Particularly important is the fast-start financing.
It is important to create such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and understandable to EU citizens in order to allow them to make full use of it.
The Agreement will make the Canadian and European markets not only more competitive, but also safer, because of the continuing approach between regulatory authorities and law enforcement on all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement to ensure the maximum possible level of safety for passengers and freight flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can hold a fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).
Moreover, its private aspect not only strengthens the image that Europe is presenting in the world, but also promotes European citizenship.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that we are discussing today is aimed at amending the regulations adopted in 2004, which improved and harmonised the safety regulations on the protection of EU citizens' passports and travel documents from use and, at the same time, introduced biometric identification elements.
Secondly, some kind of temporary institutional framework must be created for the decision-making mechanism.
However, it is good that some of the agreements that we have concluded over recent times are very good, for example, the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important to remind Parliament once again of the Commission of the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that the way in which it approaches its constructive cooperation with the European Union today is much more effective than trying to constantly resume history.
As much as it does today, the European Commission has found neither the necessary arguments nor the time to exert influence on the Latvian Government so that it stops discrimination based on language.
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link any form of assistance to the Pakistani Government with the urgent elimination of these damaging discrimination against the country's religious minorities.
This will be an effective tool for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
This is something that is acceptable and just and we have fought to achieve it.
Obviously, more than any other moment, it is necessary for the financial institutions to cease and re-evaluate their approach.
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we have achieved this in committee.
The main objective of'aid for trade' is to boost the internal and international competitiveness of 48 countries.
Even if we accept the sensible approach of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, the burden only on heavy goods vehicles, not on average cars, in order to reduce traffic congestion, just like the old'polluter pays' principle, is clearly applied by introducing unfavourable discrimination.
The understanding and support I received during the plenary debates is encouraging.
Also, when looking at the starting point, we have some concerns.
The primary objective of the European Union and its Member State governments, whether centre-right or centre left, is to ensure the continued profitability of monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers and grassroots classes throughout the European Union.
Action should therefore be taken to spread good practice and raise awareness among local decision makers of the advantages that ICT can offer.
Mr President, English was not listening to the previous speech.
However, there is one particularly important aspect of this recast, this codification, which relates to the whole of the restructuring of the TEN-T networks over the next decade.
(LT) Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the citizens of Ukraine, but let us not forget that it is also very important for the citizens of the European Union, because Ukraine is an important partner for us, particularly in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe.
That is why the Commission must have a strong voice.
We cannot get involved in an issue where the United States Government has exclusive competence.
People who manage our forestry areas are paid very little money or not at all to provide these hidden functions which many people take for granted.
Unfortunately, it still has to be said that the list of unresolved problems increases rather than mixed.
With regard to Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission, represented both by Baroness Ashton, to take immediate action on three issues.
There are large dealers, who have a strong presence in the market in some Member States, and there are also many small dealers, who are more pleased with what we are now proposing than what has been in force since 2002, because they have seen that some aspects that were not in the intention of the legislator in 2002 are not in their interest, but were rather more difficult for them to cope with competition with large traders.
It needs to build on the EU's' regional cooperation policy for peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa', launched by the Committee on Development when adopting its report in April 2007.
Over these years, in particular, following the historical enlargement of 2004, the content and ambitions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) have changed considerably.
Spain is taking over the Presidency of the European Union at the same time as the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force.
In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme complies with the objectives already set out in the EU 2020 strategy and the digital agenda and included in the Single Market Act's priority actions.
I would like to unreservedly support Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission's draft has been amended in accordance with the report currently on the vote, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
For this reason, it is important that we reach agreement at first reading.
These people need more help, and they should not be excluded because of their place of residence.
Any form of medical assistance, regardless of its specific characteristics, belongs to the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to point out to Parliament the fact that a recent study by the European Cardon Partnership has once again shown that there are serious limitations to this methodology due to the low levels of women's participation in these tests.
It is not about using investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but it should not be about preventing us from achieving social and environmental objectives.
I call for greater emphasis to be placed on the recovery of organic waste, particularly in this largely agricultural area, to verify data and establish a system for exchanging best practice.
According to a completely incomprehensible law, the orthodox, expedient and patriarchal must be Turkish citizens.
The most important point of the position adopted by Parliament is that it draws attention to the dissemination of the measures, which may therefore be inated to be inconsistent, not only as a body of legislation, but especially with regard to their implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon ensures that the European Union joins the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least the issue of the digital Single Market has succeeded in including in the EU's priorities.
This would be an important step forward towards transparency, openness and clarity in the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), since it makes perfect sense to debate this issue.
Is that the economic growth model that Europe should propose to Europeans?
In principle, I do not allow speakers to exceed the speaking time given to them, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was extremely important to us.
We want a suitable strategy based on new technologies, innovation and investment, a strategy which, when implemented, ultimately improves the quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region.
This is, in fact, a great achievement since, without thinking about the legal basis, this directive recognises patients' unquestionable rights and creates a new number of possibilities of access to better treatment for patients.
For years, the Court of Auditors has failed to give us the satisfaction that the EU budget has been spent legally and normally, and the lack of control over taxpayers' spending was an issue that was of great concern to me when I was in the architect of the European Union in 2002.
For me it is as huge a challenge as it is a great honour.
If we want to be honest, we have to recognise our historic responsibility towards climate change, as well as the fact that our per capita emissions are still many times higher, for example, China's or India's emissions.
I am sure that the forthcoming dialogue will be constructive.
We therefore deplore the fact that, as in the case of Europol, hasty has overridden the desire to protect fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposal, which is intended to add a simpler method of using the resources of the European Social Fund so that this can react more quickly and in a more substantial way to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing.
To be honest, I should have voted against the Commission's proposed composition, but together with the weak candidates there were also several very good candidates - including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
You are very polite, Mr Kirkhope, but as well as Britain, there are basically 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that, although we are very welcome to the concerns you have expressed, I must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I believe that we must be careful at this point in order to maintain the neutrality of the EU response to humanitarian crises, even if this is sometimes difficult in crisis regions.
It also adds new data to what Parliament has already stated in the past, as it calls on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission to evaluate the findings of the investigations by all the parties and to report to the European Parliament, underlines that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States demand inadequate monitoring of the investigations and is concerned about the pressure on the NGOs involved in the drafting of the Goldstone report, including the measures in its limitations.
I also hope that this decision will help rescue fish species that are disappearing.
I hope that you will not consider my questions to be a challenge, but a help for reflection.
I am always willing - and I hope I will also be in office - to come back and give explanations about our findings, but we must first confirm our findings.
This result will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in international trade talks and especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.
When Europe speaks with one voice, the United States of America will also adopt the same goal.
That is why I personally support the prices set out for European tobacco growers, at least for as long as people continue smoking in Europe.
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is very clear that some countries are facing the problem much more seriously than others.
I would therefore like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) that is separate from the European structural policy.
The number of new infections continues to overcome the rate of extending treatment to two thirds of the people in need of treatment in 2009 did not receive it, which means that 10 million people in need have no access to the necessary effective treatment.
Indeed, when we hold an assessment of human dignity, we do not treat minorities in a negative way at all.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
All the EU institutions should, in future, ensure that the aim of our budgets is to help individuals and businesses to cope with difficult economic times and plan for recovery.
The fastest way of treating them, more effectively and more practically than every measure, is to support the political initiatives and activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions.
To all those who are still fighting this Treaty today in the false belief that it strengthens the European Union, I would like to point out this: those who are fighting this Treaty actually strengthen our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents.
Strengthening international capitalism by the European Union will destroy us all.
We will have a meeting shortly on TEN-T, where the Commission will promote the development of a network of other modes of transport.
You will remember that it was a violent fight, because it ended up in the European Court of Justice, and the Commission - which I have to say to her - was divorced, more divorce from the Council at the time, and we fully supported the Commission.
The first Member to request the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.
(DE) Mr President, we can clearly point out the line being taken by the governments of the main EU Member States, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
Indeed, I would like to remind the House that there are still more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union - the figure has probably reached 25 million complex - which means that attracting yet more asylum seekers is, in fact, a kind of group suicide.
The Commission must impose sanctions, not the finance ministers.
Sri Lanka is dependent on foreign direct investment and on EU financial support for its economic recovery.
We fully support the objective of the'Antwerp initiative', but we could not support the reference made to another vote by Parliament which supports abortion and goes against the previous explanation of vote recorded in Parliament's record, among other things.
This document is the result of a compromise after long negotiations, and it reinforces the application of passenger rights without imposing additional burdens on carriers.
It is now time, in fact, to breathe new life into the letter of'the Arctic' EMU', by creating a real and effective economic union as the last stage of the integration of economic policy.
I have shown particular interest in the issue of children's rights in external relations.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has been trying, for 10 years now, to equip itself with legislative acts in the area of economic migration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for removing national administrative and technical barriers preventing the marketing of construction products within the European Union and for continuing the creation of a single market in this area.
I believe that, if we really want to adhere to the objectives that we have set out in the treaties in the area of our foreign policy, we still have a long way to go before we can send Libya the migrants who are staying in the EU illegally.
I therefore supported the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships as part of the Innovation Union flagship initiative, and I think we should all participate in the action on innovation because, as I said, it is very important for the future.
We have a newly elected government in the UK that has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
Economic crisis and environmental policies can go hand in hand and have a positive effect both on the environment and on job creation.
There are some countries that do not use all of the ESF funds granted to them and leave around 30 to 40% unused.
That leads me to question - even if the Commission has declared that it has the information and published it, that it is obliged to publish it - why it has not been known, for example, that particular case.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I strongly support the proposal to organise an effective information campaign for increasing the visibility of the TFEU.
It seems somewhat curious that the Spanish Presidency is appealing to combat the economic crisis and wants to make the implementation of the economic policy objectives mandatory.
Today, I voted in favour of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection because I believe that the deadlock in the Council as a result of the language arrangements is unjustified.
I repeat: the treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced to take debts.
I would like to remind you of the joint agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the 2010 declaration of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
I would like to assure this House that we will continue to raise these issues, at the highest level too, in reminding the international obligations of the People's Republic of China in terms of human rights.
I hope - and I am sure - that your votes will be the basis for reaching an agreement.
First of all, I regret that the Commissioner's colleague, Mr McCreevy, is not here - I think that the period of football has begun again!
You may not know that, but extensive animal testing is needed, for example, so that such claims can be verified.
Something that gives me suspicion, Commissioner, is the major influence of the CARS 21 and the influence of industry on the process which it is beginning here.
We do not agree with all of this.
The support planned by the EU for the 2007-2010 period with the aim of supporting the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova is over EUR 50 million.
Of course, we cannot understand how a worker is working illegally, and it is ultimately the one who recruits him to cover his or her staying and living costs.
I believe that this measuring system based on the affirmation of various parameters will lead to political decisions that will be more responsive to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to point out that political dialogue between the EU and Belarus should be conditional and should be directly linked to the lifting of bans on freedoms and an end to violence against people involved in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists.
Finally, High Representative, you will travel to the Middle East.
Worse still, the US Congress passed a US draft law on the protection of US personnel just one month after the ICC was created in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain briefly that this report contains the amendments unanimously voted on by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, following the decision taken in this plenary session on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission proposal aimed at permitting the promotion of poultry meat to human consumption, even following the awarding of micro-caring.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express my deepest sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deep concern for the four other Cuban prisoners and opposition activist, who started a hunger strike in order to protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto must be not to squander a single cent of the euro.
The Union, and the Mediterranean countries in particular, has always been at the forefront in delivering humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, as the principle of solidarity with the people living in such problematic conditions is fundamental.
Often, domestic workers themselves are also excluded, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this case.
(Loud and applause)
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, as it stands, and despite the fact that some amendments have helped to improve it, Mrs Guillaume's report is a real incentive for people to abuse this process by hampering the relevant services and depriving those who really need to review their case quickly.
It is our turn and responsibility to pursue this objective with all our powers, and I would like to thank the two authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work, which is to the benefit of all of us.
We have completed a truly huge programme with some major reports.
The so-called social dumping is a significant threat to workers, as it undermines their fundamental rights.
The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
Madam President, I would like to ask, in relation to what the Commissioner has said about evaluating every proposal, whether the region in question can conduct a study beforehand, including on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the region's specific nature, so that there are criteria which each country will have to take into account and respect for its design.
We must also address the issue of Roma women, who are suffering from particular problems of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and the problem of new Roma, also because the lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to access work during this period of economic crisis.
in writing. - (PT) I am happy to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), with the aim of extending its interventions in the housing sector, with the aim of helping marginalised communities in all Member States.
It also reminds all political players in their sphere of competence that, in order to achieve genuine freedom of the press, public authorities must actually play their part: they must be ready to protect freedom of expression and promote its development.
Mr President, I think the European Union has become too large, made up of too many cultures, and I simply do not trust that system at all and things will get worse.
It is a little early to announce the results of this analysis and, as the Member will know, every stage in this process requires unanimity in the Council.
It is important to note that the EU's integration prospects are the strongest incentive for Balkan countries to undertake the necessary reforms, as well as a regional stability player.
Now that advertising plays an even greater role, it is necessary to define the criteria which allow consumers and patients to be fully informed, and certain, of the kind of actions that these medicines have.
Using Neil Armstrong's words, it will be a small step for the European funds, but an enormous leap for the European economy.
Thirdly, the security loopholes that some have repeatedly claimed will be created if we do not vote for the interim agreement do not exist at all.
In addition, the rapid spread of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has caused increased online gambling supply and the resulting incidence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved.
