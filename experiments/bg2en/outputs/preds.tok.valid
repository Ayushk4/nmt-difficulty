Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 summit in London will be a cornerstone of the global response to the global crisis .
In the conclusions of the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament , it is stressed that imports of agricultural produce from third countries have much more harmful effects on the environment than domestic production , which is subject to stricter provisions on reducing CO2 emissions , which is why it contributes to climate change .
It is , in fact , difficult to accept that the countries to which this money is allocated cannot use it .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
Maritime institutions in the Member States must work much more closely together to harmonise their curricula , as well as offer opportunities for paid work and exchange experiences with European shipping companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe .
We note that we want more and more of our farmers .
Frontex must be assisted and the EU must make the relevant authorities in the Member States fulfil their obligations .
I would also like to add a point which nobody , except Commissioner Almunia , has not affected to date .
The main areas relating to the effects of climate change are as follows : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity and , last but not least , population health .
Allow me also to express my own sorrow and that of the Commission in connection with the deaths of the nine Turkish soldiers and the police following terrorist attacks last week .
Commissioner Piebalgs , I would like to congratulate you on everything you do .
However , it is deplorable that , following the resistance and the concerns expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education concerning the playing down of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is increasing and is causing problems in numerous EU Member States , the Committee on Budgets has made the necessary amendments , which I supported , and increased the planned funds ( for example , the case of Article 150202 of the lifelong learning programme ) .
Then there has come to power a minority government with completely different political belief , but no one thought it was a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , the international community , have seen , while the Abyei question remains unresolved in the referendum , is , in fact , a very irresponsible and is a way to arrive at a war to start again in the future .
The case of the Romanian competitor , Marian Cozma , cruelly murdered by two Roma members in Hungary , once again shows us that crime knows no borders and that ignoring the problems of this community is counterproductive .
You need a clear EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should be a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to combine the resources of the Member States to achieve optimal results and to work on common strategies and transactions that will make Europe and political union - the dream of fathers - the founding fathers of the Union since this week , and this week we celebrate Europe Day when we recall the Shutang Declaration .
That is the request we are making .
We are all , as was Hungary right from the outset , supporters of the Single Market .
Ineutral climate change compels the public and the European Union &apos;s economy to adapt to a new reality .
Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and help find solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It was a wonderful trialogue story and , as most of the short curious stories , it is good that it is over .
It is extremely important for NATO to remain vigilant and support us , especially in Afghanistan at present .
However , something will have to happen and we will have to take action .
In this respect , a solution will need to be found on common aspects , such as the reduction in VAT rates , exemption from the scheme , the possibility of establishing the maximum rate and , last but not least , the place of taxation for suppliers &apos; tax within the EU .
Let me inform you of some facts about the West Midlands : our region is with the highest youth unemployment rate , and our motor industry has been collapsed , partly because of the EU &apos;s financing of jobs in Slovakia , resulting in the closure of vital jobs in the Raton plant .
It is important to ensure that these newly created institutions are not put under pressure to undermine or weaken the basic rules for reforming the financial sector .
Enough is enough .
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of research centres that can share specialised infrastructure and exchange useful information and data .
Qimonda is implementing the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office because the situation in third countries , and especially in Africa and the Middle East , continues to deteriorate .
Mr Severin very well pointed out the strategic synergies that Europe needs a strong United States of America , and the EU needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this flow of refugees will mean for us , in view of what part of it can be covered by the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will make every effort to abolish visas .
Ultimately , it was not an inspector of food or an EU food safety inspector who did not have the revelation , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we must use our views on military capacity , with the emphasis on soft power and the avoidance of a new agenda , as already exists , but which has become clear in Munich because President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter a new era of negotiation for disarmament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present this evening to you the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which the Committee on Budgets prepared some time ago .
In September , the members of the Moma party did not vote in favour of appointing Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , as the results he achieved did not recommend re-election .
By restructuring agricultural policy , we can ensure that the focus will be on animal welfare , that they live in conditions suited to their species and are strong and supportive , on the principle that prevention is better than cure .
Now we fear that , if the scope of the directive is extended , it will be affected by the same fate , as the last attempt to introduce the &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking , in other words , that it will be blocked again by the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing politicians , Member States and the European Union to put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts for economic recovery .
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States , both with deficits of more than 10 % , will have to suffer significant adjustments to restore the stability of their public finances .
We need to separate these issues , or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , but I do not believe that this is his responsibility .
Obviously , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from the wine wine insult adhering to high quality policy , in particular in Province , it would be unacceptable to legislate on a secondary product received by mixing end products , and to allow misleading references to flower rosé .
However , there is also an awful lot more that needs to be done .
What will happen is that there will be cuts in jobs in Europe &apos;s rural regions and a fall in food production opportunities .
Let us also remember that , despite these institutional issues , the Swedish Presidency and this autumn , of course , it is very much influenced by the need to move forward on climate change , the financial crisis and the fear that Europe needs a job creation policy , a whole host of extremely important problems that we need to tackle .
However , I would like to stress that we know that several texts needed for police and judicial cooperation will need a new basis which will enable Parliament to play its part as a legislative actor .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs for overlooked the ethical element , which is naturally a Member State competence .
This is a good thing because it is young people who will decide the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must remember those who have already made a very important contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we are formulating an economic recovery plan , in which we are giving three and a half billion to the oligarchy of energy giants and no euro to partners that we need to involve ourselves in amending environmental energy .
Fishing quotas and stock management are essential to preventing excessive fishing in domestic and oceans .
We would have preferred to have seen Parliament &apos;s funds increased by reallocating them and , as a result , measures to improve efficiency than a general increase in the budget .
In addition , the package can show how the European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , effective and constructive manner in this important area .
I believe that an approach to concentration efforts at the initial stage ( so-called frontloading ) , as recommended by the Commission in its proposal for a recast of the texts - in other words , improving the quality of the first instance procedures , will allow us to achieve real savings of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and we have managed to reach a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to place EU orders on outsourcing in countries which do not have the same level of environmental requirements as we do .
All the comments were fruitful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
They must work hard to reach understanding between 27 Member States , reflect the unity of Europe and the desire to overcome the crisis and to maintain the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament on matters of democracy and human rights and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At the same time , the funds earmarked for just two types of projects aimed at reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions , i.e. capturing and storage of carbon dioxide ( CCS ) and wind plants in the North Sea .
If the EGF had been proposed to allocate funds to redundant workers in Britain , we would have voted in favour and we would receive criticism if we did not do so .
As far as activities are concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational , but is still in the early stages of its development .
It affects our neighbours and includes our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as further like Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
I am very committed , together with my colleagues in the Commission , to integrating the principle of gender equality into all the policies that we are going to put forward .
These projects will help to bridge the disparities in the links between the systems in the European Union and will enable further optimal use of the EU &apos;s own resources for energy .
Moreover , this approach is based on policy , and I believe that , above all , another Europe needs more policy , and this is undoubtedly one of the obligations of our Parliament .
There is also the issue of FIFA &apos;s failure to implement the navigation technology after other sports have already done so .
However , we can organise different forms of training or workshops during which we can provide real support for accessing European funds earmarked for rural development .
Other Members use the lack of such a policy as an excuse for their bilateral transactions with suppliers , which often do not even meet the requirements for transparency and fair competition , and even less so for European solidarity .
Furthermore , I welcome the fact that we have managed to create closer working relationships between Parliament and the Commission on legislative programming .
In particular , many Member States have made significant efforts to fulfil their obligations with regard to the pact .
The aim is to enable the EU to respond to the major challenges in society , which affect all Member States and to which they cannot respond independently ( ageing population , health , energy supply , water supply and food security , sustainable development , combating climate change , etc . ) , and to develop knowledge that enables our businesses to develop more innovation and to strengthen their competitiveness .
Although we will support this decision tomorrow , I believe there are some inconsistencies in the current budget and I would like to point out two more significant than those in my opinion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will continue with questions about the governance of the world economy , and particularly financial regulation and the timely follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to address this issue a little more thoroughly .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to support their reintegration into the labour market .
The crucial issue lies in the desire of Europeans not to accept any more of the consequences of the freedom of establishment , which will inevitably result from accession .
This is an ungrateful , difficult role .
This is in the first place among our priorities .
EU support is essential as a guarantee of the independence of the state .
The Israeli Government continues its militarisation with armed attacks and its military crimes at the beginning of the year .
The evaluations and additional visits from teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are prepared to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal maintains its five surface vessels .
increase in the budget in these areas and the creation of new military capacity , which will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would also like to emphasise the contradiction between the commitment of the Pakistani Government in the area of religious freedom and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries to approve their &apos; Combassador &apos; programme of defamation of religions &apos; in the United Nations .
I say this afternoon because it is my frank view .
I believe that the compromise that the Council has reached is good because it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , it is absolutely essential that rapid , coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions , such as the introduction of programmes to send old cars back , with a consequent reduction in the purchase price of a new car , financial assistance , etc .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is correct , but it does not seem to be very compatible with the very important entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon when the functions and powers currently shared between the two pillars are to be consolidated .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , that is the question &apos; .
Such a policy is doomed to failure if people working in the fishing industry , from seamen to traders selling fish to consumers do not comply with the rules .
This expensive , ineffective talk , such as this Parliament , devalued as an artificially puzzzled illusion of a accountable democracy , the monstrous deception of the electorate who sent us here .
This is a pity because we should be united on this issue .
We no longer say that trade liberalisation and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industry in Europe where , to some extent , we are not concerned because the climate problem must take precedence .
The debt rate - we are seeing the painful facts that testify to it - is paving the way for economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this report will help to clarify the various aviation agreements and process in the most seed way , and the criteria to which we should also take into account the aspects that we must follow .
I will vote for the telecoms package , but I will do so with some reluctance because I believe there was a fundamental betrayal at the highest level with regard to the basic principle of liberalising telecommunications , which it was supposed to be achieved by this directive .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
They will have a greater impact and a lower price for the taxpayer if we succeed in coordinating our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive which will make it easier for citizens of Belarus to obtain visas for the EU , as well as a readmission agreement .
Allow me to give a concrete example .
Let us look , for example , at the education of children and schools .
For the time being , we also do not know whether the standards that we introduce for the legal trade in timber will enter into force and apply globally - some speakers have already paid attention to this issue .
The establishment of a special committee on the financial and economic crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of measures taken by Member States to support sustainable and qualitative growth is crucial .
I voted to change the rules on vaccination against bluetongue , which will allow the application of more effective vaccines and reduce the bureaucratic burden on farmers .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for the formation of strong , integrated EU policies .
In abstaining from the vote , I would like to express my deepest disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which was far below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payments often lead to difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , and no one disputes it , but we must not insist that citizens bear the brunt because they are , on top , our only chance of getting out of the crisis .
In the United States , they have an early warning system for this purpose .
This is the case with my constituent Andrew Symeou .
We must defend our rights , freedoms and our democracy together .
Speed things up , that asked the Europeans to choose this Parliament , and we should give them , if we want to go to vote after five years .
The parts of the text on which the European Council is competent were discussed and adopted by the European Council itself .
The high consumer costs of the private sector per capita have increased by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At this stage , I believe that it would be useful to work effectively on the appropriate ways to enforce existing laws .
The conclusions of the summit in this respect are too vague .
To this end , the proposal provides for standard instruments which allow measures to be taken to implement or precautionary measures in order to avoid the problems associated with the recognition and translation of instruments issued by other Member States , as well as a standard form for notifying the documents relating to such claims in the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because it takes into account the important policy areas and individual opinions .
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes to cooperate at European level .
For example , the Council &apos;s decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 created Member States &apos; capabilities for cooperation at national , intergovernmental level for prosecuting these crimes , which unfortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinocht - are even part of the legislation in some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen as supporting the acquisition of &apos; easy EU money &apos; .
Our purchases are increasingly remote and the Internet has now completely changed our habits , partly because our lives are becoming increasingly prohibited .
With regard to information , we are constantly providing information as we receive it .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in education of the young generation , and here I mean lifelong learning .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am delighted that we have achieved a satisfactory solution to the problems in the final version of the agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , thousands of people are affected , many of them with small children who do not have the necessary means .
The procedures are quite different when it comes to seizing the Commission under future provisions of the possible future Treaty and to seizing Parliament through the petitions procedure .
Human rights must be respected by all parties to the conflict in the Middle East .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to face up to our responsibilities .
We have heard that UNESCO , in any case , steps have been made to the Chinese authorities with regard to the impact on the development of the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
My fellow Member , Schwab , is proposing a report that aims to improve car safety by introducing requirements for enhanced security measures for car manufacturers .
That is why I voted against the report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have demonstrated our ability to act and reinforced our resistance .
If we consider Parliament &apos;s position towards external bodies , for example , human rights organisations that could affect , and we do not reach an agreement , although I hope that this will not happen , and if individual projects are not implemented for that reason , I believe that we will find support and understand Parliament &apos;s position .
These meetings of Parliament on Thursday afternoon are increasingly assumptive in terms of both the empty Chamber and the issues discussed and the way in which they are treated .
I refer to the fact that there is still complete uncertainty surrounding this , whether Moldova will succeed in choosing its president and , if this does not happen , the country will obviously start to new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 and 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome the compromise reached , because it raises the issue of democratic deficits , which women have been facing for years when helping their self-employed spouses in trade , craftspeople , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , without recognition of the years in work .
Of course , our political bias are clearly different and sometimes are radically contradictory .
I would call it climate justice because it concerns relations between developing countries and developed countries and the will to put forward a credible proposal for financing the measures and for mitigating the effects of both adaptation and how we show our willingness to conduct others .
I would therefore like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks , which have benefited from aid , but did not take the appropriate social approach .
Not only do I have three children , but I also have a grandparents who currently have nothing other than milk .
We are ready to draw up technical assistance programmes that accompany the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities need to undergo .
We ask that it be drawn up by the Commission .
As you claim , we need to constantly renew our statistics and Eurostat is examining this issue .
I sometimes wonder if we have not learnt entirely from our lessons regarding the consequences of our actions when we do not respect European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific , even though we have to tackle together .
Electronic reports also show that sceptical scientists to hypothesis have been removed from the peer review process in order to avoid a lack of public scrutiny .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet shed light on this very fascinating section of society that we are still struggling with , and very badly .
We do not know what people we are doing , and that is why the institutions must bear in mind , they pose a higher risk and , therefore , they must be subject to stricter control .
Our priority during work on the review of the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic devices in the EU .
Preventive work is carried out mainly in schools , because this social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependence .
The EU has been successful in bringing this continent together since the end of the Cold War , and today it is expected to preserve previous advances and continue integration once better times have taken place .
Many Members of this House want an answer to their questions this evening and we would like an appropriate order to be respected .
We know to those of us who were involved that there was no alternative that the dairy farming problems were to be resolved , and now hope we are moving towards solving some of the problems experienced in part of the sector .
Secondly , the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity regulations , but we have decided to abstain from similar references in this report because we oppose any family policy dictated at EU level - such issues must be decided by national governments .
Last but not least , I think that the next talks that we are going to hold on this subject should deal with the issue of the European Union Mission to support EUBARafah : how to resume this mission and how it could be extended .
So the Commission will monitor the situation and , if necessary , the Commission will take action , but I think we should not go beyond Community law structures and the Commission will certainly remain under Community law .
Once we all want to see a true European diplomatic service , which is not just a continuation of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which will be discussed today and on which the vote will take place tomorrow , are of paramount importance .
in writing . - In the context of the existing gap between men and women in terms of employment , salaries and access to management positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC , ensuring that their provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislations .
I abstained on the vote on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try to get the Commissioner the assurance that no further progress will be made over the next few weeks unless any further progress is passed on to justice .
We will look at this issue soon during the discussions on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , Wednesday , 20 October , the European Parliament adopted the report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already talk of increasing taxes in the near future so that state finances do not sink into state finances .
Today is the time to raise our voice and to demand that Christians and other religions are free to practise them .
Within the EU , 31.5 % of women work part-time work ( 30 hours or less per week ) , compared with only 8.3 % of men .
I share the cautious optimism like the Commissioner and the Minister , and I feel that the sky is being torn , but there are still many clouds .
At this point , very few of us could have envisaged the scale of the economic crisis under way .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction , showing that it is on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
The policy in question has become a key element of the economic recovery package , creating added value and supporting efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , demonstrating at the same time European solidarity .
Unfortunately , we still do not know whether or not the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force , and obviously it needs to enter into force without further delay .
However , I believe that the situation clearly demonstrates the disastrous situation of agriculture , certainly in my region at least , when farmers must be accompanied by days of packaging outside , in an attempt to secure modest sums of EU subsidies .
The southern European Member States did so too late .
This should be done with the implementation of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will in a democratic vote , which is why tomorrow &apos;s day is very important .
It should be noted that providing housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , especially in a modern social state .
In my opinion , the definition of political priorities requires their careful consideration , transparency and democracy .
The subject of this particular project is the deployment of a traffic management system .
( HU ) Over the last few months in Vojvodina , Northern Serbia , a sense of fear has taken place among several nationalities who live there , mainly among Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise , sometimes a difficult compromise , and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved , on our behalf , a result that is real and feasible .
We agree with those parts of the agreement which provide equal treatment with regard to Parliament and the Council as regards access to meetings and to information ; regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament ; cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives ; an assessment of the impact of legislation ; and rather , the use of acts with optional legal force ( rather than criminal law ) ; we do not agree with the confirmation and strengthening of compulsory application of the application of the directives and the ultimate application of the European Union .
You all know that there cannot be broadcasting without access to radio spectrum , such as EU policy , aims to ensure that all market participants receive non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum .
This will provide us with a common and relatively broad framework for action by the Commission on progress in equality between men and women , in the areas that my fellow Member has just referred to , starting with employment , to the other ways in which it is important to ensure and guarantee this equality .
We expect the other major political and economic actors to also present their proposals , as so far several have not done .
Dementia , and especially Alzheimer &apos;s , are not only serious medical problems , but also extremely sensitive ethical and social problems , the burden of which will continue to increase in relation to the ageing of Europe &apos;s population .
I would also like to say that you have stressed very carefully that we should not confuse the various responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to turn to the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , allow me to start by first by thanking my shadow rapporteurs , who had to analyse the issue in detail : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have given them a helping hand and , with the full support of all the European institutions , I ask for Minsk - please take it up - because you and the people of Belarus will gain a lot .
We need to monitor closely what is happening , because the President said that thanks to European companies , we could save EUR 38 billion annually .
Now , since the verdict passed against Liu Xiaobo , we have witnessed even a ban on a party of homosexuals from the police , which clearly threatens to lead to a political ice era for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your statement on Ukraine today was very clear .
We have to recognise here that this will only happen if parliaments take part , because only through parliaments can properly adapt most regulations , and also that this process and proposals relating to the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue and the transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance .
Someone mentioned helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , it was pleasing to see you here and to hear your speech .
This is what I would like to emphasise in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a strong message to women who are helping their spouses who are self-employed .
Anyone who was in Gaza after the conflict can testify to the huge suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States are , strategically speaking , the most important for the European Union .
I have to say that our ambition is to reach a political agreement at the European Council in June .
However , we all know that Europe cannot function any longer and better with less money .
At the same time , the large number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting fills me in the hope that the actions of such a large number of allies will ultimately have a chance of success .
Mr President , I would like to speak in favour of the motion not to have a resolution because , in the speech by Mr Schulz , I heard something which I believe is very important : if we really want the debates to include &apos; Europe &apos; and not just Italy , then there is no point in voting on a resolution entitled &apos; freedom of information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of the report .
The recommendation by Parliament proposes approving the regulation proposed by the Council , and immediately , as the new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and guarantee equal treatment of illegally staying third-country nationals in the field of social security .
This is a directly shocking figure , and I have already referred to this figure in a report that I drafted in the previous parliamentary term .
However , an EU Arctic policy is perhaps not as strange as the appointment of the highly incompetent Baroness Ashton , who is like Seava Pelian &apos;s former student left , to the post of High Representative .
Such an achievement is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is , quite simply , the most ambitious trade agreement ever signed by the European Union and which must serve as a basis for comparing our future bilateral trade agreements .
I cannot vote for the amendment tabled by the Conservative Party to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that it should be reduced and their negotiating position is a weak starting point .
With regard to the car industry , I believe that we have attached far too little importance to the development of completely new types of cars , carbons powered by bacteria and cars powered by fuel cells .
Our roads will then divide themselves .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her initiative to draw up a report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner for Thailand , the European Union is ready to support the country within its capabilities during this complex process .
In fact , to ensure that the derogation in question , which should contribute to the creation of jobs and wealth , is truly beneficial to the local population and does not harm the European fish processing and canning industries , it is important to anticipate its impact assessment as soon as possible and cancel it where necessary .
This is what the Commission and the Council are currently dealing with in a commendable manner to ensure that gas supplies are resumed as soon as possible , and the intimidation of legal action is not the most effective way of acting , of course .
It is imperative for Member States to investigate cases of extreme human rights violations of Roma women immediately , punish perpetrators and take measures against all victims to be identified and compensated .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a complex issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisors , but also - and this has not been commented - of the importance of cooperation with national parliaments , and particularly with the committees on European issues , budgets and budgetary control .
I would suggest to you now that the European External Action Service creates its rules for accessing information and access to documents , make it a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not work with foreign policy , as if it were the verdict of any secret diplomats .
All countries are currently changing their economic policies in order to get out of the difficult economic situation as quickly as possible , and to achieve at least a certain level of economic growth .
And let me also tell you something about the Japanese people .
In response to Mr Barroso said that this is an internal question .
We are therefore one of those people who believe that it should not be weakened , but rather retained and strengthened .
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity come directly from the Christian tradition .
While it is beneficial for large corporations , it disrupts public transport and is due to the maintenance of the network and safety .
On the other hand , discussion of Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot be unilateral .
This risk must be managed effectively and , as the tragic events in Japan reminded us , we urgently need to be managed .
The main objective of this agreement is to guarantee greater protection for workers against the risks of injuries with all the sharp instruments used in medicine .
In short , I am finishing with this report this evening , but the work is far from over to me , nor to the European institutions .
Firstly , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and to stress that my group from the outset was rather cautious when approving SIS II , due to the many consequences affecting the protection of personal data .
The necessary conditions must be introduced .
The Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints in 2009 , compared with 3 406 in 2008 , which represents a 9 % reduction .
The European Court of Justice also clearly rejected compulsory retirement in the run-up to a certain age in its decision of October .
There are also significant possibilities to use EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety , environmental protection and the smooth operation of road transport , since they can be used when charging .
The situation in the area of cohesion , which accounts for almost one third of the budget , remains without change , namely , that is the only budgetary area in which the estimated error rate is over 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report which received the majority approval .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of proposals to resolve the crisis by moving towards a green economy , namely energy , broadband Internet and innovation , is to enable large enterprises to expand into new , profitable sectors and not to protect the environment or meet grassroots needs .
I therefore share the concern that you have expressed that the important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency can be influenced by national transfers or specificities , not by what unites us .
I agree with the conditional payment of costs based on prior authorisation in justified and preliminary cases , when cross-border healthcare includes at least a one-day stay for the patient in hospital and requires highly specialised and costly medical equipment , or there is a special risk to the patient or the public .
The most important way to guide will be , and remains , to aim for a more stringent reduction target of at least 30 % .
Passengers are very harmful , particularly for those actors that make a genuine effort to mitigate environmental damage .
Past visa scandals show , of course , how easy they take some countries into account for issuing visas .
The poor populations in the countryside , who need the most funding , are once again left to rely solely on themselves .
I know that you have the capacity to deal with these challenges .
Mr President of the Czech Republic , I would like to extend a warm welcome to you in the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orbán did not come before the groups in the European Parliament as a European politician who seek consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; in populist and nationalist tons that &apos; protects the Hungarian people &apos; from &apos; attacks &apos; .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I therefore have a positive attitude to this report and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to create a nuclear bomb .
I am completely against the US idea of preventive bombings and against NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of Europe &apos;s stability conditions .
( IT ) Mr President , the report by Mr Garriga Polledo is a very important document which enables us to define a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
With this in mind , we are committed to creating the conditions by which the fisheries sector will be truly sustainable and can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic region are difficult , but there is no doubt that , with new technologies and achievements , the region will inevitably be open to making greater use of its natural resources , fisheries being a perfect example of this .
The unemployment rate among young people reached 20 % at the beginning of the year due to the economic crisis , while school drop-out rates reached 17 % , with young people most severely affected in rural areas .
Nowadays , there are strong Ecolabel , images and texts on the market which may be confusing for consumers , from the images of forests on the teamed containers containing hazardous substances to claims on food with neutral carbon footprint and even environmental cars .
We opposed this proposal because it attempts to shift responsibility to European countries for the plight of the Third World , instead of having to replace the countries themselves with it .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking everybody &apos;s time and I am slowly announcing it , but I do it once in 10 years , so perhaps you will not mind it .
This is a delicate job which requires a change of everything to the better , and it simply does not have enough experience .
Only last year did we agree to remove these rules and , although there was no tangible difference for consumers , our producers had and continues to have .
I believe that the proposals in the package are not ambitious enough , because they are aimed only at austerity and limiting the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) funds to be reduced , because this would mean that agriculture costs less in Europe .
At the same time , the closure of such a huge facility before the time envisaged in economic readings involves a huge direct and sacrosanct price .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the compromise proposal reached .
Mr Valdis Zatlers , President of the Republic of Latvia , it is a great pleasure for us all to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the drama &apos;s development has taken place .
When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigrants can pass and when there is a readmission agreement - which is the objective - and therefore the European Union &apos;s agreements with this third country are strengthened - the global approach and the philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration - from what is obtained is to strengthen the borders of the Member States of the Union .
We regret that the report did not fully adopt our proposal , but we welcome the fact that it has reached a conclusion that is very close to ours .
Provided that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an open world trade environment is one of the obligations assigned by President Barroso to the new Agriculture Commissioner , I will take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner in this Chamber to ask him how he sees cooperation with his agriculture colleague in terms of concluding the negotiations as part of the Doha Round .
This report proposes the simplification of financial monitoring and control and the strengthening of technical and scientific assessment through peer checks based on excellence .
The proposals that have been made today must be considered , analysed and understood in this light .
It is also necessary to point out legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , rules on financing and , in some cases , intellectual property ) that could renounce a large number of key actors in the research and SMEs .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will revise Directive 2007 / 52 in view of the aspects that have just been listed .
That is why I also voted in favour of regulations that place emphasis on corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , with regard to the new issue that we have developed together , in other words , the issue of transparency , progress has been fairly slow to make progress in practice with new regulations on access to the documents for those who are in breach proceedings or who want infringement proceedings to find out why they are finished or why they are increasingly fewer open , and look at them .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that in this House , which , unfortunately , is always half empty at this hour , this is not the first time that we are debating the terrible human rights situation in Burma .
It is therefore the task of society to act in such a way that women and men can freely choose between the two variants of logic , each of which has its grounds for existence when considering it from a broader perspective that does not end up merely with work .
Today , the cartel promotes the consumption of products with a slightly reduced food value , where thousands of livestock farmers find themselves in a situation where they are unable to sell their products in a country that satisfies 50 % of their own production needs .
The extreme consequences of the current situation for our portfolio and for the development of our activities cannot yet be clearly seen .
In the context of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is just as important today as it has always been - and perhaps even more important than ever .
Fossil fuels create centralised , hierarchy and inflexible energy distribution .
In this respect , I share the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU has exceeded its mandate , so it is worth reviewing the achievements achieved so far .
I believe that the review of the first railway package must identify the problems facing Member States , which have received reasoned opinions from the Commission , and propose a way of solving them .
Israel does not understand that such a broad military response creates a new potential across-suicide attack and paves the way for new Kassam rockets at the earliest opportunity .
The Burmese authorities preferred to ignore the protests against the closure of Aung San Suu Kyi , and calls for her release were made by a large number of countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General ASEAN and several ASEAN members , an organisation in which ultimately a member of and Burma .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , pointed out that guarantees for the EIB &apos;s activities in the EU budget amount to almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009 , which is very much even for the EU , and therefore Parliament is quite rightly waiting , in my opinion , for an explanation of the risks associated with this obligation .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved the project , but on behalf of Timo Soini , as well as on my behalf , I would like to establish the place of information relating to the project needed by citizens of all Baltic Sea countries before the start of construction .
Without the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would not have been made .
I believe that conducting an information campaign in this area is of paramount importance .
In fact , since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to guarantee the verification of identity documents owned by Kosovo .
In addition , clear and precise rules are being introduced in this area .
Would he like the concept proposed by Mr Corbett for federal United States of Europe or a freer conception that provides for free trade , which my party advocates ?
First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report she has presented today .
This is not impunity ; impunity is to continue like this for years .
A person of so many qualities is rarely met .
I firmly believe that everyone in Slovenia will agree to carry out such a stress test immediately in Krško .
It is not a good sign that some Member States do not want the summit on employment this Thursday .
We have established that a large part of the work done on implementing the indicators , and we call on the Commission to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to meet all the requirements in the nearest time .
In conditions such as these , allowing the Moldovan Government to force its population to finance such insecure European programmes and agencies as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or SESAR , when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , similar to cynicism .
This would mean both achieving two objectives , because this infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and provide jobs , while at the same time mitigating the effects of crises of this kind .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Hanti-Mísk , it was agreed that our common objective was to conclude a strategic agreement that would provide a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations for the foreseeable future and help develop the potential of our relations .
It is now clear that we are not yet meeting the requirements as regards events in the Mediterranean , and particularly those in Libya : we need to think more deeply about recognising that we will probably have to take more active action to realise what is happening and that we will have to act in a coordinated manner with regard to the Mediterranean .
Significant European funding for this line was conditional on the proviso for supporting the project by the local population and providing funding from private Italian investors .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , reports on the accession process were published in the countries of the Balkans .
For this reason , we have also abstained from the vote on the proposals of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on issues relating to the TV1 in Portugal , even though it is known that the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of the situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed a reporting regime for each country individually so that transnational corporations are accountable to each country .
One of the key issues highlighted in the report is the problem of prostitution and trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , as regards the completion , the work of the Tribunal will not finish even with the arrest and trial against Mr Mladić and Hadžić .
In addition , I call on the Commission to support damages actions brought against responsible companies by fraudulent farmers who , without knowing , have dropped their animals .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and improve the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to succeed in finding solutions , we also need to apply the same approach in the future .
But you know that our message is structural reforms ; structural reforms to build Europe &apos;s growth potential and its job creation capacity are extremely important .
Particularly in the context of the global financial crisis , this partnership can be of priority and greater opportunities open up for trade , scientific and technological exchanges , thereby helping us emerge stronger and more stable from this crisis .
We cannot tolerate this any more .
The adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have increased Parliament &apos;s responsibility with the administrative burden that this entails .
In a period of unprecedented crisis which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that the number of European workers unemployed or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration of corruption that I have proposed together with four other Members of this House , which has been approved by half of the European Parliament plus one voice ; it is its aim to involve the Council and the Commission in legislation that is truly effective in combating corruption .
Mr President , honourable President of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully agrees with your group on your programme for Parliament and on its management over the next five years .
For the sake of democracy , let him fulfil these promises !
We believe that it is through such dialogue that we will succeed in helping these countries , especially by increasing the involvement of civil society .
While , as a socialist , I believe that the party in Sri Lanka will not lead to a decision , the Tamil population is entitled to defend itself against military repression .
Now is the time to stand up for simpler and cheaper measures for SMEs , which will naturally lead to the creation of more jobs and higher growth .
It is very important that when we fight this phenomenon , we adopt unified security measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
When we talk about claims , the question of the United States of America and its experience and extremes is always raised .
The rapid entry into force of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on extradition and legal aid will give momentum to criminal law cooperation and eliminate the synonist zone that made possible areas for exceptional extradition .
I have three proposals and I would like to ask most strongly that they be supported .
It has already been submitted several times to the European Court of Justice to decide , in certain cases , whether sport activity is a service with a purely social benefit or , on the contrary , it also covers economic aspects , which means that it is a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is of the highest priority in this institution , and citizens must know this .
Only time will it show whether this is an isolated case , or whether the unquestionably positive impact of the directive will prevail .
By modernising the logistics of freight transport and promoting co-modality , i.e. combining various modes of transport in the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region .
The Member States should be given the opportunity , within a democratic process , to decide whether they wish to ratify the International Labour Organisation Convention in question .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income vary between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that will be finally adopted will not be so bad .
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment in many ways .
We ask international donors , both government and non-governmental , to stop their activity in certain areas if the bill is adopted .
This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights and an aspect that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe was born in our homelands .
Therefore , if I am speaking to a Hungarian police officer in Slovakia , he must respond to me in Slovak , even if his mother tongue is Hungarian , and despite the fact that I do not understand his response .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to refer once again to an aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the area of internal order and justice relating to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the United States .
In the past 2009 , we have seen an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection , both in individual EU Member States and in new developing economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency was not taken seriously by the Commission or the Council .
Finally , on the political front , it is important for us to be in a union with the ACP countries within the World Trade Organisation .
We need to act in a completely different way .
If we succeed in bringing together an abandoned child and a family which holds soul for children , we will have made a very important contribution .
As an important step for the success of the 2020 strategy , I would like to talk in particular about how important it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing with each other and for us to cooperate seriously with regard to the instruments without which it would be impossible to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU &apos;s humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza must lead us to look at Gaza in a more strategic manner in the long term .
Other indicators need to be developed which will help clarify what factors affect living standards in a country .
According to medical professionals , the treatment of appropriate medicines can delay up to one year the need for the person suffering from the disease to be moved to an expensive old home .
Commissioner Tajani , responsible for industry and entrepreneurship , is committed to investigating losses in this sector .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package includes four draft solutions aimed at implementing the Council decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is largely a vote on the situation of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent international context and in times of economic and financial crisis , the EU has a duty to increase its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , pursue its interests and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by organising its capacity and resources to find an adequate solution to them , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and security .
This is a good moment in relations between the two parties , and the results of this joint agreement are also positive .
This will be a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which will , in all likelihood , contribute to greater legitimacy for the European project among EU citizens .
I suggest that you review the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - ;
However , if we want to tackle this successfully , we must support these actions with firm and decisive political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , I will tell you this for the last time .
I would like to make sure that these exceptions have been foreseen for either a certain period of time or the fulfilment of certain criteria , irrespective of how they are structured - maybe the Commission should consider what proposals it intends to put on the table to meet Indian demands to some extent .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , the Italian Prime Minister said what he did not , but it was not because , thanks to his entrepreneurial activity , he worked to tens of thousands of people .
Whether it takes place at the right time or it will not have to be evaluated by Parliament itself .
Therefore , the aim of the report is to emphasise how pertinent it is and , at the same time , to call for changes : to amend excessive administrative and financial regulations and the low rate of success that still seriously hamper access to the programme of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , at a time when they are playing an important role in transforming the results of research into products and services ; to ensure greater cooperation and to ensure better coordination between national research sources and national stakeholders at a time when they are still engaged in the funding .
The point is that the ECB is not independent of the Greek crisis ; it has demonstrated its partism .
It will not lead to the competitive disability of our industries .
It called for a global ban on so-called &apos; human inspection scanners &apos; .
According to statistics , around 4.3 million people die each year in Europe from cardiovascular diseases and over 1.7 million from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective means of protecting Europeans from infectious diseases , but it is also important for healthcare to reach developing countries in order to contribute to increasing life expectancy and tackling poverty .
We must therefore say out loud and clear that it is utter for the banks to use the new rules introduced in the euro area to increase their income , at the expense of our citizens .
We must definitely ensure in this economic situation and , furthermore , here in the European Parliament , that the costs are under control .
I therefore believe that better protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
He plays a very important role because he has observed all trials in the Supreme State Security Court and has regularly evaluated the living conditions of detainees in Syria .
We need a European strategy for combating natural disasters and we need better internal operational and coherence of the various Community instruments .
It seemed then that each of the new Member States would respect the EU &apos;s fundamental principles and the prohibition of discrimination , as well as protect and value the linguistic diversity and rights of national minorities .
Not only is financial , but social credit .
The new measures will make it possible for European citizens and businesses to claim their rights , especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications or social benefits , as well as residence benefits .
This issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not isolated .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue with its impact assessments , with a view to devising , if appropriate , the EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by the end of 2010 .
There is one fact : men are entitled to be fully involved in the first few days after their children appear in their family .
Such intentions deserve recognition , not criticism , although this is not the essential moment .
The reality shows that we in the European Union must break off our full dependence on Russian energy supplies .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s eleven largest trading partner , with trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounting for a total of 1.6 % of the EU &apos;s external trade in 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the rapporteur , who included this in our Rules of Procedure , was not I , but Marylène Renault .
The fisheries sector of that country is still completely undeveloped .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today &apos;s sitting we are debating four reports and I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for the work carried out and the European Commission for their cooperation .
With regard to the summit , I agree that this is an important development .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which will apply - and I am referring here in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comments - in the same and unbureaucratic manner throughout the EU , without prejudice to existing cooperation between Member States , pursuant to Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that representatives from China were welcome to examine the documents in the archives of his government in exile to make sure that he did not overcome the violence .
This is their response to the problem , which is hindering their development and integrating them into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day in the media and here in the European Parliament , we are witnessing very demagogic statements which have no professional basis .
Human rights are a key aspect of the EU-Pakistan agreement and therefore , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must depend on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive because it is expected to have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it has a direct impact on the buildings in which they live and enjoy .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position on - albeit temporary - derogations from the principles on which the European Union was founded , including four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not agree that it is acceptable for Parliament to consider this as grounds for asking for a larger budget .
It is time to finally put an end to this unilateral privilege enjoyed by the United States .
Commissioner Dalli and the Commission , as we already have this directive , I would be pleased if you would pay more attention to the regulation on social security , which is the system on which everything is based and which clearly provides for an understanding of who is paid and where it is well organised .
Let us never forget our common objective , and let us work together with Arctic countries and the international community to find the best and effective way to protect and preserve the Arctic for future generations .
I believe that it is indeed necessary and that it is a good example of how , in the process of shaping the budget , Parliament has managed to use the funds that , to put it , have not been used in other areas .
Now let us look at the hypotheses .
For this to happen , we must make every effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In more sensitive sectors such as clothing , leather and leather , creating conditions for consumers to be informed in their choice is a serious issue for businesses that have decided to maintain production in Europe , keeping European secrets and jobs .
Although violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proven to be an effective foreign policy instrument , encouraging the strengthening of relations with third countries , which has certain real benefits .
Moreover , it is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission not only has the right , but also the duty , to express its opinion .
With this draft document , however , we are tearing up this barrier and doing so because of the need to care for patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of the proposals and their urgency .
I believe that all patients have the right to quality healthcare and healthcare granted in their mother tongue , close to where they live and close to their family .
When we speak in this House , we must use the atrocities that everyone has adopted , and the application country for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , not Macedonia , has been accepted .
This is achievable and will produce better results .
Recent developments in the European economy , not least around Greece , have shown that there is an urgent and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
For it not to remain backward , their Sart Wody stated that the cost amounts to GBP 120 billion per annum , which is almost 36 times higher than the true figures .
The military approach to Belarus - sanctions and incentives , as I think Mr Tannock called it - will hopefully be the success .
We can speak with hours on many issues - energy , the limitation of arms distribution , just name it , but I think it is important to have this fundamental agreement in the three reports that have been presented today on what we have done in the last period of time .
Secondly , he also stated that the Commission should also start exploring the possibility of Eurobonds - at last , I would say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the law on the protection of minors and minors ( debate )
This is not the reputation that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
According to the regulation , tyre providers have a duty to use labels and rockets to provide consumers with information about fuel consumption , traffic resistance , train navigation and external noise in contact with the road .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also think that in this attempt to achieve bolder and more ambitious results in the final phase of the negotiations at COP-16 ( the 16th Conference of the Parties to the PRC ) , the European Union should give its main negotiating chief negotiator some flexibility to be able to respond to events .
Therefore , balanced and transparent measures are essential , since gaining the confidence of our entrepreneurs is a precondition for the success of the project .
There is a problem with the disastrous impact of mass urbanisation on the environment , particularly on coastal zones and the Spanish islands , but also on other areas , such as Madrid .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia continues to monitor the situation very closely by working closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
These processes must include the necessary maintenance and oversight after closure ; the processing , storage and disposal of waste ; the improvement of the environment of facilities ; and support in the replacement of the power plant &apos;s energy capacity , with particular attention paid to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I am also of the opinion .
As a man of a cyber bicycle with a nightmare I meet when I go to a supermarket in my home country .
For example , there has been a general discussion about the sale of fertile land in developing countries and in countries without any sorts of land ; their purchase itself is a very interesting topic to discuss and , in my opinion , is also a subject on which we can reach some agreement .
Without a pan-European network , however , the main objectives of the European Union will not be met .
In a Europe of 27 Member States , 17 produces seal June and they are all supported by their governments .
One of the three - English , French or German - will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout the EU .
In Ireland , this is a very controversial issue which provides material to the defenders of rejecting the Lisbon Treaty by referendum .
The Presidency has done everything it can to reach an agreement , but ultimately it felt that the matter had to be decided by the European Council .
While Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that , in some cases , we are in different opinions .
That is the way the Commission works .
However , it may have been a one-off phenomenon due to the transfer of the Agency &apos;s long-term utilisation building .
The proposed amendments will allow the less developed Member States , including Romania , to fulfil the requirements for accessing this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear colleagues from all sides of this House giving a very high assessment , and quite rightly so .
I must hardly stress the importance of both phenomena , given the current situation .
We will work together to conclude the Doha Round with a positive outcome in 2010 , because this is of paramount importance in efforts to promote recovery and the fight against protectionism .
Ladies and gentlemen , today is a special day for me because , after ten years of good and fair service , today &apos;s session is the last under my chairmanship here in Brussels .
In efficiency terms , I also find it interesting to see the proposal to take on from the delegations of certain consular functions , such as Schengen visas .
It seems that we had spent too much time discussing between ourselves and others , and we were ultimately clearly defeated .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos;s draft needs to be better prepared , so Parliament needs more time to make its decision .
Perhaps there are plans to go further than is currently being proposed .
Without the European Union and its protective mechanisms , all Member States would be in a much more difficult situation .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in the area of primary education for all , the eradication of poverty and the granting of greater access to clean drinking water .
President Barroso this morning , with the Treaty of Lisbon , he said in parallel that it was the Commission that spoke on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
You can express an opinion , even dissent , is allowed even to have Eurosceptics , but the final outcome must be one .
Lukashenko , who is a clever political player , has managed to make use of his campaign &apos;s programme , make use of all political and economic benefits and , at the same time , continues to show contempt for democracy and human rights .
In turn , under the same declaration , the European Union and Russia hoped to hold negotiations and conclude agreements on local border traffic between Russia and its neighbouring Member States of the European Union , which would be interested in doing so .
This is the most important thing for the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself talked about gaps that have yet to be filled in implementing our legislation in a number of Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure that it is properly recycled , not only in order to prevent environmental and health damage , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot help but remind you that for Omar al-Bashir , an international arrest warrant has still been issued , a fact that the authorities in that country ignore .
The letter also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of implementation of the project , and the preparatory work on the report is in progress .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I expect you to call for order in response .
With regard to the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market , the proposal is fundamentally sound , insofar as the ban and the gradual replacement of products that have a serious impact on human health are concerned .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to establish fishing opportunities for EU vessels based on unnecessary stocks , as well as financial assistance for access rights and support for the sector .
We in the EU need to provide the new Tunisian unity government with all the help , and also to provide every assistance to EU citizens , including British citizens , who are unable to leave the country once they have been there on holiday .
Fellow Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and proper for Taiwan to be transferred to a positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional means of communication often fail because of commercial interests or because their management belongs to a certain political circle and indirectly imposes on their employees the practices of automatic censorship .
We cannot coexist in the European Union until this situation continues , and therefore we believe it is very important that the Commission , the authorities in the European Union and that we all put forward proposals along the same lines in order to put an end to this situation .
This , on the one hand , but I will also monitor a number of social , environmental and economic criteria , as I am committed to prior evaluation of all regulations .
I therefore voted in favour of the report on the seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds ( EDF ) .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are talking about Belarus in the European Parliament , but talks are not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support and speak in favour of this proposal .
Next , I am very pleased that we are discussing the possibility of East Jerusalem being the capital of the future Palestinian state or Jerusalem as the capital of the two countries .
The third lesson we can learn is that the European Union must be put into diligence .
However , there are significant differences between regions in the same Member State .
Prevention and elimination of violence against women are important strategic objectives , essential for the progress that our civilisation is seeking .
I look forward to your answers .
On 30 January , the preliminary results of the referendum held in 10 June were announced , which showed an exceptional majority ( 9.5 % ) in favour of the secession of Southern Sudan .
Personally , I believe that Europe needs a single energy policy in order to avoid excessive dependence on resources coming from one single area .
The Food and Veterinary Office has also revealed huge shortcomings in the Brazilian traceability system , as well as problems with many transmission references to the European Union that do not possess the necessary certificates .
Now , in turn , the committees will take the floor .
So I think the most important question now is : how can we build further on what the Swedish Presidency has achieved ?
The role of the European Union must be strengthened in the context of the consequences of this crisis .
The requirement for mutual dialogue and opinions expressing the need for respect and respect is fundamental to this proposal .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to return tolls to the names of the streets and towns in Polish in the areas where most residents belong to the Polish minority .
Since all these actions are interconnected , necessary and suited to the level of ambition laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result as soon as possible , in line with citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of this report , as it represents a significant improvement in the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour of this resolution .
The aim of the report is to increase risk tolerance , simplify bureaucratic monitoring mechanisms and build greater confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I support what Mr Daul said .
The resolution adopted today highlights the fact that the establishment of a common register guarantees the widest possible participation of all categories of operators while respecting their differences or their specific identity .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to put a question to the President of the Commission , who has been involved in the situation we have seen in recent weeks in the Mediterranean , where many people , in rescuing from the situation in Africa , have addressed to Europe , but there have also been those who have failed to do so .
However , this does not happen , a sad example of which is the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel is bombing and killing off a anger .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
The question of the common agricultural policy and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
The partnership must be based on respect for one another , for our common commitments , and also for the values that the European Union upholds when it comes to human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
Its share of EU GDP is 3 % and takes into account a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this respect , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled an amendment calling - not just for Europe , of course - for the United States of America , as the Commissioner is aware - for all forms of export subsidies to be completely eliminated , and for this to be the case now .
Most participants in the consultation highlight the need for the CAP to focus on the competitiveness of European agriculture , compliance with climate change , food security and the requirements for their quality , as well as other environmental protection objectives .
Furthermore , we believe that the negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be completed before the May summit on development in Madrid .
The next item is the joint debate on
Of course , it is extremely important for subsidies to small cities to be increased by the European Union , as these are the places where there is the greatest potential for the economy and finance , because small cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will be formally presented in the Committee on Budgetary Control , not earlier than next week .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gases , as scientists have recommended , and to prevent biodiversity loss , we need significant financial resources .
Only the carrot-and-stick policy as the main driving forces in the accession process can make the governments of the countries concerned concentrate their efforts to carry out the necessary work and reform which once and for all strengthen stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will focus my speech on two of the reports because of their importance .
In the interests of the legal certainty of all interested , we must have the same rights throughout Europe for those accused of infringements and there must be compulsory information about these rights .
External affairs and diplomacy are defined by national priority and we therefore voted against all reports on this issue .
I am thinking of Rule G , of making it easier for Mr Weber .
I also appreciate the positive assessment of the proposal of the permanent efforts of the FYROM to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened in Greece today , just a few hours ago , will not prove to be infective , and I hope , on the contrary , that it could mark the start of the unanimous efforts aimed at forming a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We are in close contact with the people of Tunisia and with the people of Egypt every hour , with our delegations , to whom I pay tribute for what they have had to do over the last two weeks , and we also have direct contacts with the government and the services .
In fact , I am convinced that this financial instrument is all the more relevant in the light of the financial crisis , because it can help companies to recover more effectively and may become a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund in the future .
These inspections were insufficient .
We will then be able to make a major contribution on the part of Europe , but it should be within some limits .
I voted in favour of the special report by the Ombudsman to the European Parliament in relation to the draft recommendation to the European Commission in complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , which relates to the excessive delays of the Commission to the Ombudsman .
The main progress made in this directive compared with existing legislation is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and have access to information about the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I would reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund flexibly , as well as to review regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund , in order to amend them according to the needs of the tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer rights organisations and business representatives , I understand that we need to push for even greater harmonisation of legislation on consumer rights throughout the entire territory of the EU .
I said that anyone who questions questions this debate is becoming guilty .
This means that Parliament has the power and the obligation to monitor the negotiations under way - in this case of trade negotiations - and to intervene politically using the available parliamentary means , such as hearing , resolutions and oral questions , in order to be able to progress on the respective negotiations .
There is no recognition of the solidarity invested by citizens in social cohesion , or intergenerational solidarity .
However , real reform is about admissibility .
This is one of the most serious human rights problems in the European Union today .
To this end , appropriate financial resources must be provided which will enable the EU to take advantage of opportunities and new sources of global competitiveness .
In many European countries , when public authorities are in a difficult situation , they know that in general , they pay late and often cause bankruptcies to companies .
The G20 conference also referred to the elimination of tax fraud as one of the main objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
Of course , the dollar remains at the forefront of international transactions providing still safe investment , but the colonial debt of the United States , which has accumulated in engaging the rest of the world to finance their lifestyle , will increasingly increase the suspicion of the ability of the largest economic power to fulfil its commitments .
We must make sure that we ensure that a free society has the necessary means and measures to combat and defeat those who want to destroy it .
I will come up with a convincing argument : when Iceland was the wealthy side , it did not have any interest in joining the EU .
This is not a new demand , Vice-President of the Commission .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and the involvement of all to ensure a very high level of adoption at local level .
However , it is a problem that will be exporting the fight against international terrorism in neighbouring countries and regions as long as the Afghan combat continues .
We must fight against slavery , and I call on Commissioner Andor to maintain the European Social Fund as he stands and not to divide it , as is sometimes proposed in this House .
It is , of course , in the nature of the compromise not to include everything we want .
I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure , and the rapporteurs , László Surján , Vladimír Maňka and Jutta Haug , for their constructive behaviour during the procedure , which is a sign of the very good cooperation we have achieved in our joint work .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to emphasise that the negotiations are not open , which would lead to more realistic alternatives , for example , a privileged partnership with the EU .
This is therefore , above all , an American problem to be resolved from Washington .
Let me also say that we need to implement a reform that makes European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers and that create dynamic development in knowledge society .
The quotas they buy can be retained in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if they so wish the Member State .
Therefore , I appeal once again to 25 May , the date of his execution , to be set for an international day of the heroes of the fight against totalitarianism , because many unfamiliar people who , just like Pilecki , have lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be remembered .
Allow me to refer briefly to what we have done .
If this were to be prevalent in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the hard-funded peace plan drawn up following the wars in the Balkans .
I hope that these changes will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want to play with figures and see EMAS compete with ISO , but because I believe that the scheme is a good scheme and could help us achieve our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker answered a blue-card question by Cristian Dan Preda under Rule 149 ( 8 )
As several speakers have already pointed out , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important and I think it will proceed well .
Volcanal dumping and the social consequences that result from it must no longer be allowed to happen .
This situation is vital for securing an effective Neighbourhood Policy .
By setting out best practices based on Member States &apos; experience and complying with fundamental standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment and protection from direct and indirect expropriation , we will achieve the basis for a consistent European policy on this issue .
I know that during public consultations on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep meat sector declared compulsory origin labelling .
I am fully aware of the complexity of the problem , Mr Kelly .
Although many countries are facing a number of economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to halting the adverse effects of climate change .
Please support you .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will trigger a serious parliamentary debate on the processing of the own resources system .
So , in general , the admissibility of these measures has been broadened .
The Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to give expression to its views on the audit process .
The levels of fraud in France and Spain , for example , are considered to be &apos; suspicious low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council stopped the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solving the problems and whether there is security of their money .
It is therefore important to establish a network for the sharing of statistics in Member States and a platform for coordinating research into the causes , ways of preventing and treating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I , too , share the view expressed by many in this House that the more solidarity we have , the better the relationship between Europe and Russia , will be .
Syria must go a long way until it reaches freedom of speech and association .
Much remains to be done before we can guarantee women fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate that the proposal needs to be reassessed to take into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following changes are proposed in it :
We are well aware that the situation of dairy farmers is unsustainable .
I voted in favour of this report because I wanted to emphasise , in particular , one of the threats that it mentions : the lack of reliable and detailed information for consumers about the health properties , composition and origin of certain fish species .
After all , history has plunged with examples of interference from Western countries , which has done more harm than help .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and cannot resolve the problems of crime for several reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a key political development and , contrary to what has just been said here , Hamas has , for the first time , agreed that the CMO and the Palestinian Authority should be its partners in the negotiations .
Countries are being made and negotiations are being held on the seabed .
The latter is of paramount importance , especially given the problems of the energy infrastructure that ...
In other words , it is precisely the organisation that is designed to protect us from criminal action ( indirectly by providing vocational training to police officers ) that ends up being subjected to the defensive soft .
The transfer of power from Fidel Castro to his brother , Raúl , has not brought about any democratic reforms or the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency assessments will also be specified in all advertisements containing information on energy consumption or on the price of products .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know the consensus of Washington : you all like it .
In this way , we will be able to respond adequately and effectively to the things that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union ( FRONTEX ) and , without any other things , has already been done .
Finally , I would like to thank not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and extremely positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this issue , and I very much appreciate the support of the Presidency for our efforts to find a practical way of continuing the negotiations .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to private sector issues makes it particularly appropriate to balance European Union legislation with the specific requirements of the European market and European citizens .
So far , this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives for 17 days .
The number of falsified medicinal products will decrease , and their use will only become safer only when measures of this nature are taken .
We also need to learn lessons from the Opel affair : it is not yet late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automotive industry .
We did these things because , like you and we , with President Obama , reject the false choice between safety and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Pact for the euro proposes that wage reductions be made permanent in nature .
Recently , a new trial was launched at Manchester airport and the legal advice now being provided states that the use of these machinery , when examining minors , could infringe safety and child protection legislation due to the nature of the feedback obtained .
Moreover , this money does not go straight to artists .
In the area of civil aviation , the development of the system and the use of EGNOS for mafidshops must be supported .
Standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the respective activities of marine administrations ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) - Public port control ( recast version ) - Community Maritime Traffic Law Traffic Management System of Passengers &apos; Traffic Management and Information - Maritime Traffic Law liability - Respect for the Law of Ship Passengers &apos; Passenger Name Record ( Maritime Trafficking in the Law of the Law of the Law of Traffic Law of Traffic Law of Traffic Bengers &apos; Respect ) - Ship in the Law of Traffic Bans &apos; Respect - Ship in the Law of the Law of Traffic Bans &apos; Reserve ( Bans &apos; Respect for Traffic in the Law of Traffic Bans &apos; Respect
I am voting in favour of the report on the creation of a new microfinance facility , which will help people whose jobs are at risk to create or develop micro-enterprises .
It is important that we make some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I fully agree with , and I believe that this report will enable us to define the legal framework of the urban issue better , and also introduce instruments , such as municipal operational programmes , such as operational programmes , which can give a new quality of cohesion policy .
During the trialogue discussions , it was clear to me that the improvements I proposed on behalf of Parliament were essential for the existence of fair and efficient energy markets .
Given the current economic crisis , it is extremely important to support and encourage self-employed workers .
In short , we do not need to ask them from Brussels .
Mr President , for us and Europe , for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us in Europe , it is clear that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , an element of change that can cause conflicts or unite us , and that is what our concern today is about .
I voted in favour of this report because the programme of food distribution , which is currently under consideration , is an essential instrument for helping the most deprived persons who are severely affected in the current economic crisis , even with regard to needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States and most emerging countries , have at least one export credit agency ( ECA ) which , in their unification , represent the largest source , on a global scale , of official funding for private-sector projects .
That is why we did not support the report .
By taking this position , we have contributed to the destruction of this common government .
By creating a Council of France Council for Muslim faith in 2003 , Mr Sarkozy , who was , at the time , a minister for internal affairs , introduced Islam in French institutions .
On this point , I have already asked the European Commission to issue an opinion and consider the possibility of creating special programmes for creating equal opportunities for women in science .
This is a fight that we will continue to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unrestricted access to services by end users .
European politicians and thinkers understood very well that the strength that Europe can join is the general approach to economic problems .
The borders between freedom and security must also apply within the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope from this summer , the Commission will take the lead in the coordination of the strategy in the development of events in key areas such as the promotion of civil education , vocational training and employment .
Costs will be covered by the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what we can do to create a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the region .
We can therefore expect an accident to reactor every 25 years .
In my opinion , greater eligibility in the housing sector for expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF should also allow us to consider other possible developments in the medium and long term , whether from the point of view of eligibility for funding or the allocation of funds for certain strategic priorities .
The time has come today to talk once again about violations of religious rights in both countries , but this time we are talking about Christians .
Climate change : one of the biggest threats to our planet .
Of course , a great deal of emphasis , as I expected , has been placed on human rights - the importance of ensuring that they are respected is , without doubt , part of all the dynamic relationship that we uphold and characterises our whole business .
I also have to say that , for the time being , the European Union has no competence over air traffic management .
At the same time , Europe is not a animal or a light for the economic crisis .
So I can confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission regarding comitology and the additional regulations .
I do not believe that any of the warm words said here today , even those said by the Commission , can change the facts that the European Union does not have a presence in Libya and that it is not even able to stop the crisis in cities or the actions of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s Sound forces at the moment .
Therefore , I firmly believe that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , it will bring great benefits to the citizens of the European Union , as they will have the opportunity to make much more choices .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I share the hope that the necessary measures will be agreed in the European Council to calm the markets and to bring back stability to the euro area because , whether we are members or not , we are all interested in doing so .
Financing from pre-accession assistance is proving to be particularly vulnerable .
This is a cause for fervent girls and joy .
We therefore call for an end to the war and violence by all actors , and we urge the EU to take appropriate action .
The world outside Europe faces the challenge of energy .
The indicator of measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in advertising for selling and renting which occur in the media .
It is essential to encourage efforts aimed at increasing EU investments in terms of the diversification of cross-border structures , incentives to create initiatives , non-standard forms of energy at local level and improvements in infrastructure capacity to facilitate the connection with new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , resulting in the growth of internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the creation of a rapid reaction mechanism within the ENP to respond quickly and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as has recently happened in the southern neighbourhood .
I think that someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia to condemn the EULEX mission is simply grotesque .
The problem is that the only Members listening to you are the ones who can do so in the original language .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted issues that concern our fellow citizens , our constituents , namely our environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the preservation of jobs and the fight against crime , because in order to do a good job , we must be in harmony with those who voted for us .
The European Union budget cannot be used , as some colleagues have claimed , in addition to national budgets in times of austerity ; rather , it must reflect the difficult situation faced by the Member States of the European Union .
Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty does not give the Council any powers to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States .
This is not the usual way to go .
You can call me a cynical , but students do not always come to study , and tourists do not always visit for a short period .
Is the global financial crisis , which has become an economic crisis the cause of this situation , or are we here encountering our own errors : negligence and lack of action ?
The second &apos; but &apos; relates to the role played by the Belgian Presidency in the post-Lisbon period .
The main objective of these regimes was to maintain the territory of this huge country populated by whole range of very different peoples .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already declared the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still struggling with the negative consequences of the crisis .
This has generally been a situation in many areas in relations with Japan , but I acknowledge , for example , the right of Japan to defend its market in rice , to protect farmers who grow rice , to pay higher than those in the world markets , and to say &apos; no &apos; to mass imports , which may destroy farmers , just as I acknowledge the rights of our economies to protect certain sectors of their activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I will discuss two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
That is why I am determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen social priority , as I have already told you , when we discussed the more general political guidelines for the next term .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will essentially go through by asking you what measures - and here I use the multiple figure - intend to take the Commission in the short term to address these shortcomings .
That is what has been lacking to date , or what has not been sufficiently visible for our citizens .
It does not care the citizens , and quite rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 00.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal by approving by a large majority Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report , to which I thank , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania is in favour of an open door policy aimed specifically at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that everything must be done to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I would also like to make it very clear that the labour incidents taking place relatively often and also the hazardous substances used in the process of work .
In September 2009 , the Council took a detailed look at the agreement amending the decision establishing a European Refugee Fund .
It is now important that we take into account the specific features of island and outermost regions , which , in addition to their constant difficulties , are now facing a destroyed infrastructure , private , commercial and agricultural property , and in many cases are unable to return to normal life immediately , especially in regions which depend almost exclusively on tourism , as media representation of events could well dissuade poor and potential visitors .
Since 11 September 2001 , we have not seen such permanent disruption in industry to such large financial losses , so despite the financial difficulties currently being experienced by all Member States , I would urge them to subsidise plans to support an industry that simply cannot suffer more losses .
At the same time , we have to recognise that the risk we run is also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in the Congo is shocking .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small linguistic , perhaps a semantic remark .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you may very much like something - but you have to see reality .
Consumer organisations support the binding measures of the judicial system for consumer protection in all Member States , combined with other options , such as the extension of existing alternative dispute settlement mechanisms ( AFC ) and collective redress .
The problem is not Turkish Cypriots , as some people claim .
I would ask what the Commission will do to ensure that these horses do not occur in their countries of origin without having to endure long and exhaust journeys to consumer countries .
That is what we need to do .
I sincerely wonder , ladies and gentlemen , where the defenders of human rights have gone , who are happy , and we in the West are secular and pluralistic , and who shamefully give a look to the Middle East , which , in a little more , becomes a preserved area for only one religion .
This is being done and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who write our money are causing our indignation , but Mr Schulz , politicians who are now pushing us into the deficits and debts of the back of the younger generations are just as irresponsible .
I owe this to the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various groups .
We believe that it is now the turn of the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been good ; relations have , in fact , been extremely coordinated .
We must endeavour to ensure that the proposed programmes provide maximum support to the reforms undertaken in this country to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important for each Member State to have national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information , such as on the availability of healthcare , procedures and necessary documentation .
Earlier , we saw any event in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , and now we are discussing trade issues in the face of absolute freedom of personality .
Whether this fund is considered private or public , this report refers to a very specific issue , namely a parliamentary opinion on : firstly , that the fund does not have a legal claim to subsidise its deficits and , secondly , that no such subsidies to deficits will be made .
Certainly , their reputation has been the most costly since the Troja time that a thousand boats have been on their way .
Aid that distorts competition undermines the future of the European car industry and has negative consequences for both employment and technological progress .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a number of things that I believe we should bear in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard a number of Members say that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with a &apos; reverse vote mechanism &apos; .
( FR ) However , I do think it is very important to remember the real risk problems .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 )
In order to express solidarity with the campaign to prevent this barbaric situation , I would like to encourage you today to have a rose-tinted legality as a symbol for opposing this practice .
Democratic control is being obstructed , and national governments hide behind the Commission and behind the Troika on the most fundamental measures , while the Commission has sent these issues to national governments .
A new multiannual financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After a number of threats from the Commission to legal action in the European Court of Justice , Sweden also authorised the use of decessa-BDE .
It is obvious to those of us who come from rural constituencies and those who are involved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the current position , in which many livestock farmers are in , is simply unsustainable .
The winners deserve transparent information that is easy to understand and accessible .
I believe that it is our task to support the Chinese people in bringing about a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms in the vote because I am convinced that we must demand and be ambitious in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus ensure our future .
It is also important that the organiser of the initiative - a public or non-governmental organisation - clearly sets out the subject and purpose of the initiative , although it does not necessarily need to put forward a legislative proposal .
In a city in Latvia , Dugaluz , more than 90 % of the population speak Russian .
With this I would like to welcome the apologies of Prime Minister Jan Fischer , as well as the recent proposal of the Czech Republic Government , which requested by 31 December 2009 that the Ministry of Health take a series of measures to ensure that such violations do not happen further .
I welcome this report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
The impact of globalisation has now given in to the financial and economic crisis , and our measured reaction is to adjust the criteria for EGF funding .
in writing . - ( PT ) This motion for a resolution mentions the declaration of independence of Kosovo of 17 February 2008 , which is recognised by 69 countries , and the Member States are encouraged to work together by taking a unified approach to Kosovo , bearing in mind Kosovo &apos;s planned accession to the EU .
Compared to the other two institutions , it can still be said that it is a champion in terms of transparency , so I would not make it my top priority , because both in terms of access to documents and in terms of transparency in our meetings and activities of Members of the European Parliament , we are more open than any national parliament .
This was a renaissance of domestic politics by the Italian Reform Minister , Mr Urberto Boy .
The sentences made by the Human Rights Observatory in my constituency , Abkolas , and by many other organisations , deserve to be adopted with due attention .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I very much regret the adoption of the resolution on the prohibition of thrombin or swine origin .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and I will follow the investigation closely carried out .
However , the European Commission &apos;s figures are not entirely sufficient either to identify disciplinary measures for Member States with the highest rate of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth anniversary of the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions in sectors not covered by the emissions trading system by 20 % .
With regard to the second question , I can assure honourable Members that the Commission is aware of the fact that controlling resistance to antibiotics requires a multidisciplinary approach .
Yesterday trialogue provides many hopes for a final agreement .
Future forecasts based on annual growth of approximately 27 % over the next few years show that by 2015 , this amount will be up to EUR 11 billion .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal must be changed so that the text is adopted in the form of a regulation , not a Council decision .
Many people ask me what cuts in ACTA mean - I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted for this report because EU financial assistance will help those who have been victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and help them break free from the grip of the recession .
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and for development , as well as knowledge for citizens about culture , particularly through the dispersion of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and express my hope that the European Union will play a leading role in the area of the spectrum and in the creation of software for development and innovation .
All this exacerbates the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , as well as the problems that might arise in allowing a country with over 80 million inhabitants : factors that will continue to strengthen my staunch belief that it is not right for Turkey to enter Europe , the unity of which , above all , depend on the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from Members &apos; seats )
This means that it goes against the interests of the environment and consumer safety , because old equipment , which is very energy-intensive and potentially dangerous , can once again be placed on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I would like to express my thanks for the mayor of Balingen , Dr Reitemann , and the local council , which allowed the opening of the monument to the rest of these young men .
Thirdly , I have a big request to Commissioner Kroes to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we want to be proud of this major flagship project in the future .
Anyone who tests and sees the results of the ecological disaster triggered by the abandonment of the Baia Mare technology and the subsequent expiry of toxic cyanide landscapes into water wounds , with a significant impact on the Tehran fauna in Hungary , as well as in the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything possible to ensure that this does not happen any more in the European Union .
This is the responsibility of each and every one of us : it is the responsibility of the Member States , of the Commission , of the Council and of Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion annually .
Secondly , this is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and property : the fundamental freedom of movement , as you said , to cross dividing lines .
