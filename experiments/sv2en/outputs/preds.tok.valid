Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report being debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament stress that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much more damaging impact on the environment than on European production , which is why the latter is subject to stricter requirements in terms of reducing CO2 emissions , and therefore contribute to climate change .
It is not acceptable that the countries receiving these funds do not have the opportunity to use them .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
Maritime transport institutions in the Member States must cooperate much more closely in order to harmonise their educational programmes , as well as offer opportunities for paid traineships and exchanges of experience with European derivatives .
The next item is the Commission statement on the impact of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we can see is that we demand more and more of our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened , and the EU must also force the authorities of the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
I would add that no one , with the exception of Commissioner Almunia , has spoken up to now .
The following areas are most affected by the effects of climate change : water resources , agriculture , agriculture , energy , forestry , biodiversity and , last but not least , human health .
Let me also express my personal sorrow , and the Commission &apos;s sadness , at the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendark following terrorist attacks last week .
Mr Piebalgs , I would like to congratulate you on the work that you are doing .
However , it is comfortable that the Committee on Budgets , as a result of the opposition and the concerns expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education about the devaluation of policies on education and training , especially at a time when unemployment is rising and causing problems in many EU Member States , tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported , and increased initially planned appropriations ( for example , Article 1502 / 202 ) on lifelong learning .
A minority government with a completely different ideology then seized power , but no one thought it was a coup .
Indeed , the fact that we , the international community , only looked at when the issue of Abyei was left unresolved in the referendum was very irresponsible and downright the recession that a war will erupt again in the future .
The case of Romanian handbook pillar Marian Cozma , who was brutally murdered by two Hungarian Roma , shows once again that crime does not have borders and that it is counterproductive not to pretend to pretend about the problems of the Roma .
Europe must have a healthy food policy .
in writing . - ( IT ) The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new political model in Europe , both in terms of the need to pool Member States &apos; resources to achieve the best possible results and in achieving the best possible results and in working on joint strategies and efforts , which will also make Europe the political union of which its founding fathers dream years ago .
That is what we are asking for .
We are all supporters of the single market , just as Hungary has also been right from the outset .
Unavoidable climate change forces society and the European economy to adapt to a new reality .
Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and help to find both socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It has been a great three-year file of toys and , as with most of the short love of toys , I am pleased that it is coming to an end .
The need for NATO to maintain its vigilance and to receive support , at the moment in Afghanistan is of paramount importance .
However , something must happen - we need to move things forward .
In this respect , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , derogations from the system , the option of establishing a maximum rate and , last but not least , the site of taxation of trade on the internal market , must be considered .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the largest youth unemployment rate and our car industry has been decimated , partly because of EU-subsidised jobs in Slovakia , leading to significant jobs being lost from the Ryton plant .
It is vital to ensure that these new institutions are not pressurised to weaken or undermine fundamental regulations on the revision of the financial sector .
Enough is enough .
We should also facilitate the creation of a network of feed centres that can share specialised infrastructures and exchange useful information and useful data .
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office , the situation in third countries is worsening all the time , especially in Africa and the Middle East .
Mr Severin put forward strategic reciprocity very well when he said that Europe needs a strong US and that the US needs a strong Europe .
Therefore , I would like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this flow of refugees will mean and how much could be covered by the resettlement programme .
I am convinced that Canada will soon do everything to lift visa requirements .
After all , it was not a food inspector or a European Food Safety Authority that did the discovery , but the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
Therefore , we should use our vision of military opportunities with a soft power and prevention to tackle a new agenda , one that already existed but made clear in Munich , because President Obama &apos;s policy enables us to enter a new era of disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been ready in the Committee on Budgets for the right time now .
The members of the Mouvement Démocrate party did not vote in favour of Mr Barroso &apos;s appointment as President of the Commission in September because his curriculum list was not so good that re-election could be recommended .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that the focus is on animal welfare , that animals live under conditions suited to their respective species and are healthy and strong , based on the principle that prevention is better than cure .
We fear that if the scope of this directive is extended , it will suffer exactly the same fate as the previous attempt to include &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - that it will again be blocked by the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to add my voice to the proposals of my fellow Members that politicians , the Member States and the European Union should put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their efforts towards economic recovery .
Countries such as Britain and the United States have budget deficits above 10 % , and will be forced to adapt significantly to the stability of their public finances .
We should differentiate things , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , and in my opinion , that is not his portfolio .
There is obviously also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Cavada report
In addition to the insult to vineye-growers , especially in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise a by-product resulting from a mix of fresh products and to allow misleading references to rosé colour .
However , an enormous amount remains to be done .
What will happen is the loss of jobs throughout Europe &apos;s rural areas and the reduction of our capacity for food production .
We must also not forget that , despite these institutional issues , this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is , of course , greatly affected by the need to make progress in the area of climate change , the need to make progress on the financial crisis , the concerns that exist in Europe about the need for a policy to create new jobs - many important issues that we need to address .
However , I would like to stress that we are well aware that a number of texts , which are necessary for police cooperation and judicial cooperation , need a new basis and that Parliament will thus be able to exercise its role as colegislator .
I would also like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs for delaying the ethical element , which , of course , falls within the competence of the Member States .
That is a good thing , because it is actually young people who should determine the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we should bear in mind those who have already made their own significant contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we are developing an economic recovery plan that gives three and a half billion to the oligarchies of energy giants and not a single euro to the partners whose help we need to move towards green energy .
Fish quotas and the management of fish stocks are important aspects to preventing full overfishing in inland waters and seas .
We would also have preferred Parliament &apos;s resources to be enhanced by means of efficiency and redistribution , so that the total budget is not increased .
Furthermore , this package can demonstrate that the European institutions can cooperate responsibly , effectively and constructively in such an important area .
I believe that a more direct approach , which the Commission also advocates in its proposal for a recast , in other words , improving first-instance procedures , will enable economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and have managed to reach a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to put European jobs out in countries that do not have our stringent environmental requirements .
All contributions benefited .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly on its way to getting worse .
They must work hard to build consensus between the 27 Member States and reflect European unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration policy .
Madam President , as the Vice-President of the European Parliament for democracy and human rights , I would like to thank Mrs Andrikienfor an excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , the funds were only intended for two types of projects to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) and wind power plants in the North Sea .
If it were proposed that the money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be allocated to unemployed workers in the UK , we would vote in favour of them being allocated and we would be criticised if we did not do so .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational but still in its infancy .
It concerns our neighbouring countries , including our very closest neighbours such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia and other countries further away .
I am determined to integrate , together with my colleagues in the Commission , the perspective of equality in all policies that we are putting forward .
These projects will make it possible to eliminate discrepancies in terms of interconnections between the systems of the EU , and the EU &apos;s own energy sources will be used in an even more optimal way .
What more is , this strategy is policy-based and I think that the European Union needs more of politics than anything else , and this is , of course , also one of Parliament &apos;s tasks .
After all , Fifa has also chosen not to introduce targeted cambers , despite the fact that other sports have done so .
We can actually organise different types of education or workshops , where we can offer concrete help in accessing European funds earmarked for rural development .
Secondly , the absence of such a policy is a pretext for concluding bilateral agreements with suppliers , often blind eye to transparency , fair competition and , above all , European solidarity .
Furthermore , I welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in bringing about closer cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in legislative planning .
Many Member States have made great efforts to meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact .
The aim is to enable the EU to find solutions to the major societal problems affecting all Member States , which they cannot cope with alone ( population ageing and health , energy , water and food security , sustainable development , the fight against climate change and so on ) , and the development of knowledge that enables our businesses to become more innovative and competitive .
We will be supporting the resolution tomorrow , but I believe that there are some inconsistencies in this budget , and I would like to highlight two of the greatest contradictions .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will move forward on the issues of governance of the global economy , particularly in financial regulation and a rapid follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to look at the matter a little more .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to help them re-enter the labour market .
The fundamental problem is that European citizens are no longer prepared to accept the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would inevitably lead to accession .
It is an unbearable and difficult role .
This is one of our key priorities .
The EU &apos;s support is very important for guaranteeing the independence of Kyrgyzstan .
The Israeli Government continues its colonisation in Chilean after it started the year of committing war crimes .
Experts &apos; evaluations and revisits &apos; have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal has retained the five vessels that are fishing with borrowing that it had before .
Increased budgetary appropriations in the areas mentioned and the creation of new military capabilities , which will contribute to a new arms race .
I would also like to stress that it is self-reticent that the Pakistani Government has embarked , on the one hand , on religious freedom and , on the other , in its leading role in the Islamic conference within the UN , backed the programme of combating defamation of religion .
I say this afternoon because that is my sincere view .
I think that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , because it ensures both equal rights and equal treatment .
In these circumstances , rapid coordinated intervention by European governments and institutions is an absolute must , for example , by introducing programmes for returning old cars in exchange for a consistent reduction in the purchase price of a new car , as well as financial support , and so on .
I believe that the proposed legal basis is correct , but it does not appear to be very compatible with the Treaty of Lisbon , which will be more important than the functioning and powers currently shared by the two pillars are consolidated .
Madam President , &apos; progress or failure , that is the question &apos; .
Such a strategy is doomed to failure if those working in the fishing industry , from fishermen to dealers who sell fish to consumers , do not comply with the rules .
This costly , ineffective Parliament , where there is only talk , but which gives the go-ahead to being a accountable democracy , a monstrous fraud against the voters who sent us here .
That is a pity , because you would think that we should be united on this issue .
We no longer say that trade liberalisation and combating climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe because we do not care , because climate change needs to come first .
A debt burden - as we are seeing now painful evidence - stands in the way of economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
In addition , the report will help clarify different air agreements and deal with them in the simplest way , and it also lays down what criteria we should focus our attention and what aspects we should be looking at .
I am going to vote in favour of the telecommunications package , but I am doing this with a certain reluctance , because I believe that there has been a fundamental veto at the highest level against the fundamental principle of liberalisation of telecommunications , as this directive was intended to promote .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are in an unprecedented crisis .
They will have a greater impact and have a lower cost for taxpayers if we coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for citizens of Belarus to obtain European visas and a readmission agreement .
Let me give a concrete example .
Let us look , for example , at the upbringing of children and school .
Nor do we yet know whether the standards that we promote for legal timber trade will enter into force and work globally , a problem that some speakers have already highlighted .
It is extremely important to establish a special committee on the financial and economic crisis to analyse and evaluate the coordination of measures adopted by the Member States to support sustainable and quality growth .
in writing . - I voted in favour of amending the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and reduce bureaucracy for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for a robust , integrated European policy .
By abstaining , I would like to express my great disappointment at the results of the summit , which were far below the expectations of our citizens .
Late payment often causes difficulties , both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need policies based on budgetary discipline and strict rules ; no one is questioning .
In the United States , they therefore have an early warning system .
One of these cases concerns my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
We must defend our rights together , our freedoms and our democracy .
That is what European citizens wanted when choosing this Parliament , and that is what we must give them if we want to see more of them appear at the elections in five years &apos; time .
The elements of the text relating to the responsibilities of the European Council were discussed and approved by the European Council .
The per capita private final consumption has risen by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At the moment , I believe that it is more fruitful to start real reflections on the right way to enforce existing legislation .
The summit conclusions are very vague on this point .
To this end , the proposal provides uniform documents on enforcement or security measures to avoid problems associated with the recognition and translation of documents from other Member States and a standard formula for the sharing of documents relating to claims on the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because the important political areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States through financial programmes to bring about cooperation at EU level .
For example , the Council Decision of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 gave Member States the opportunity to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes and , fortunately , some Member States are part of the legislation - we all remember well the case of General Pocinity .
Thank you .
My vote , too , must not be perceived as support for the EU &apos;s &apos; subsidy dream &apos; .
Our purchases are getting out of hand and the Internet has now changed our habits completely , partly because our lives have become increasingly smoking .
As far as information is concerned , we continually provide ongoing information because we receive it .
I would like to conclude by saying that the best investment is to invest in training the young generation , by which I mean lifelong education .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that a satisfactory solution has been found to these problems in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , thousands of people have been touched on , often with small children and lack sufficient financial means .
Procedures are completely different as regards references to the Commission under the terms of possible future treaty and references to Parliament via the petitions procedure .
Human rights must be respected by all parties to the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to shoulder our responsibilities .
We understand that Unesco has in any case approached the Chinese authorities with reference to the impact of the development project on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - MEP Schwab has presented a report which aims to increase vehicle safety by introducing more stringent requirements for safety measures for car manufacturers .
That is why I voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis hit us hard , but we have shown action , and we have strengthened our opposition .
If we are talking about Parliament &apos;s position with regard to external bodies , such as human rights organisations that can be affected by this and that we cannot reach agreement , although I hope that this is not the case , and about individual projects then cannot take place , then I believe that there is support and an understanding of Parliament &apos;s position .
These Thursday afternoon meetings have become increasingly surrealistic in this House , in terms of both the poor presence we can see around us and the topics that are raised and the way in which they are treated .
I think it is still very unclear whether Moldova will be able to elect the President and , if this does not happen , it will , of course , move forward with a new election next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , economic and monetary union in Europe started on 1 January 1999 , while 11 EU Member States introduced the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I too should like to support and welcome the current compromise , because it deals with the issue of the democratic deficit which women in particular have , for years , been at risk of helping their men who are self-employed in trade , in craftspeople , in small and medium-sized enterprises , and in the free professions without getting recognition for their work over the years .
Of course , our political priorities are clearly different and they sometimes contradict each other .
I would like to call it climate justice , because it concerns the relationship between developing countries and developed countries and the will to come up with a credible proposal to finance both mitigation and adaptation measures and the way in which we also show our will to take the lead .
Therefore , I would also like to know where the Commissioner is on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks , which used the aid , but did not adopt a corresponding social strategy .
I have three children , and I also have a child who currently only drinking milk .
We are ready to put technical assistance programmes together to supplement the painful austerity measures that the Greek authorities must take .
We await the presentation of the Commission .
As you say , we need to update the statistics continually .
Sometimes I wonder whether we have not learnt enough from the consequences of our own actions if we do not apply European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific , even if we have to deal with it jointly .
The e-mails also reveal that scientists who are sceptical about the hypothesis have been excluded from peer review processes in order to avoid any deficiency in research being revealed to the general public .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this debate , which comes at such a timely time .
Perhaps the Internet has shed a light on this very dark section of society that we are still struggling with , and we are struggling with very badly .
We are certainly aware of the kind of people we have to do with here , so in the case of inspections , the institutions must be aware that they pose a higher risk and must therefore be subject to stricter inspections .
Our priority during the process of revising the RoHS Directive was to raise the safety standards of electrical and electronic equipment present in the EU .
In schools , prevention takes place , because it is the social group that is most vulnerable to drug addiction .
It was successfully expanded to reunite the continent at the end of the Cold War , and it is now relying on it to preserve past achievements and continue integration when it comes back to better times .
However , there are many MEPs who want answers to their questions tonight and out of respect for them , we want to adhere to the rules .
However , those among us who have been involved in this know that there has been no alternative but that the dairy problem has to be resolved , and hopefully we are on the way to resolving some of the problems that the sector has had .
Secondly , while it fully supports the need for maternity and paternity leave , the ECR Group has chosen to abstain from references to them in the report because we oppose any family policy dictated at EU level , and that should be decided on by national governments .
Last but not least , I think that the issue of EUBAM Rafah must be raised in the next talks that we are holding on this subject : how can this mission be renewed and possibly extended ?
So the Commission is monitoring the situation and will act if needed , but I believe that we should not go beyond the existing Community law structures and the Commission will definitely be within Community law .
Since we share the vision of seeing a genuine European diplomatic service that is not only an extension of the diplomatic service of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we will be discussing today and voting on tomorrow , are of great importance .
in writing . - In view of the persistent gap between women and men in terms of employment rates , salaries and access to leadership positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC and , at the same time , to ensure that the directive &apos;s provisions are fully and effectively transposed into national legislation .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I would very much like the Commissioner to confirm that no further progress will be made now , in the next few weeks , unless these calls are left .
We will be dealing with this issue soon , through the discussions on recasting the first railway package and the White Paper on future transport .
The European Parliament has today , Wednesday 20 October , adopted a report from the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already talk of raising taxes in the near future to keep public finances afloat .
It is time we expressed our demand that Christians and other religious professionals be able to practise their religion freely .
In the EU , 31.5 % of female employees work in part-time ( 30 hours or less per week ) compared with only 8.3 % of employed persons .
I share the cautious optimism that both Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Minister show and feel that things are getting out of hand , but there are still many clouds in the pun .
Think of us then was able to respond in the forthcoming economic crisis .
Parliament is thus heading in the right direction by demonstrating that it is on the part of the consumer .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for a truly solid report .
This policy has become a key element of the economic recovery package and provides added value and supports efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , thereby demonstrating European solidarity .
It is also regrettable that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force , and we obviously need to get it into force without further hesitation .
However , I believe that the situation clearly demonstrates the difficult situation that the agricultural industry is in , especially in my region , if farmers have to queue for days in the winter , in order to seek modest European funds .
The Member States of southern Europe have been delayed for too long .
This should be done by providing intelligent and sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
We will , on behalf of our citizens , express our will through democratic vote , and that is why it is a very important day tomorrow .
It has to be said that the provision of a housing is an absolute necessity for each , especially in a modern welfare state .
When setting priorities of a political nature , they should be examined , and they should be transparent and democratic .
The project is about the development of the life-management and signalling system .
( HU ) In recent months , there have been fear in the air of Vojvodina in northern Serbia among the many nationalities living there , mainly Hungarian citizens .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I realise that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs on our behalf have achieved a practical and workable outcome .
We agree with the elements of the proposal that concern equal treatment for Parliament and the Council in terms of access to meetings and information , a regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives , impact assessments and the use of non-binding rules ( instead of criminal sanctions ) , cannot , however , support the fact that the mandatory EU deadlines for the implementation of the directive are further consolidated and defined and not the EU .
You all know that there can be no broadcasting without access to radio spectrum , and it is Europe &apos;s policy to ensure that all market operators have non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum .
It will provide the Commission with a general and relatively comprehensive framework for action in terms of gender equality in the areas that my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to other important ways of ensuring and ensuring such equality .
We look forward to other political and economic heavyweights also putting bids on the table , which several of them have not yet done .
Dementia and Alzheimer &apos;s disease , in particular , are not only serious medical problems , but also very sensitive ethical and social problems , the severity of which will rise as the European population ages .
I would also like to make it clear that you were careful to point out that we should not confuse the different areas of responsibility and I certainly do not want to mix the responsibilities of the Member States with the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , let me start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs , who have taken the details of this work : József Szájer , Andrew Duff , Monica Frassoni and Hanne Dahl .
We have stretched out our hand and with the full support of all EU institutions , we hope that Minsk will seize the chance , because both Minsk and the Belarusian people have so much to gain from it .
We need to follow very carefully what is happening , because the President said that we are going to have an annual saving of EUR 38 billion from European companies .
Following the ruling on Liu Xiaobo , a gay party has now also been banned by the police , which is clearly threatening to lead to a political istime in China for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today was very clear .
In this context , we need to realise that this can only happen if the parliaments are involved , because it is through the parliaments that most of the rules can be adjusted appropriately , and we must also recognise that this process and the proposals relating to the transatlantic transatlantic dialogue and the transatlantic Assembly are fundamental .
Someone mentioned helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am very pleased to see you here and hear you speak .
That is what I would like to emphasise in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending a clear message to women to help their self-employed spouses .
Anyone who has visited Gaza following the conflict can bear witness to the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is strategically Europe &apos;s most important relationship .
I have to say that our endeavours are to reach political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that the EU cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , I am hopeful that the efforts of so many allies will ultimately be able to succeed .
Mr President , I would like to support the proposal that there should not be a resolution , because I heard Martin Schulz say something that , in my opinion , is very important : if we really want this discussion to apply to &apos; Europe &apos; and not only to Italy , then adopting a resolution that says &apos; Freedom of Information in Italy &apos; .
I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report .
In its recommendation , Parliament proposes approving the regulation submitted by the Council and no longer waiting for the new regulation because it would simplify the administration of procedures and ensure equal treatment in the area of social security to third country nationals legally residing in the EU .
This is a shocking figure that I mentioned in a report that I drafted in the previous parliamentary term .
However , a European Arctic policy may not be as bizarre as the appointment of the highly unqualified Baroness Ashton , the former student &apos;s Sarah Palin , High Representative .
Such a achievement is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is simply the most ambitious business agreement that the EU has ever concluded , and must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral commercial agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe that a reduction is needed , and their stand is a weak starting point for negotiations .
As far as the car sector is concerned , I think that we have neglected the development of completely new types of passenger cars with hydrogen , battery and fuel cells .
Then we can all go down our own path .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand , the European Union is ready to support the country as far as possible in this complex process .
In order to ensure that this derogation , which will allow job creation and prosperity , is of real benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fisheries processing and canning industry , it was important to provide for an assessment of its consequences as soon as possible and to make it possible to abolish the derogation if necessary .
That is exactly what the Commission and the Council are doing now in a very laudable way , to ensure that gas supplies get underway as soon as possible and , of course , threatening legal action is not very effective .
Member States must examine without delay the extreme violations of Roma women &apos;s human rights , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and tried .
( LT ) Mr President , this really is a fairly complicated issue .
I would like to stress the importance of cooperation with national regulatory bodies , but also - and this has not been mentioned - the importance of cooperation with national parliaments and , in particular , with the committees on European issues , the budget and budgetary control .
My proposal to you is that , when the European External Action Service establishes its rules on access to information and documents , you make it a modern organisation that is accessible to citizens and that does not deal with foreign policy as if it were just one area of any secret diplomats .
All countries are currently changing their economic policies with a view to getting out of this unfavourable economic situation as quickly as possible and at least a certain degree of economic growth .
And let me say something about the Japanese people as well .
Mr Barroso replied that this was a domestic matter .
We are therefore among those who believe that Schengen should not be weakened , but preserved and strengthened .
It is no secret that our European identity &apos;s sources can be originated directly from the Christian tradition .
It is profitable for big companies while leading to public transport disruptions and making rail networks and safety even worse .
On the other hand , discussion of Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU cannot be left over there yet .
This risk must be tackled effectively and , as the tragic events in Japan remind us , urgent .
The main objective of the Agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against injuries caused by all sharp or sharp health care instruments .
Next week I hope to be able to travel to Albania ; in other words , perhaps I finalise this report this evening , but the work itself is far from complete , neither for me nor for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and I would like to stress that my group - from the outset - was very careful to accept SIS II because of the many consequences it has for data protection .
There must be appropriate conditions .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman registered 3 098 complaints , whereas the equivalent of the figure for 2008 was 3 406 , which represents a 9 % reduction .
In its October judgment , the Court of Justice of the European Union also clearly rejected forced retirement because of the retirement age achieved .
There are also great opportunities for the use of EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety and the environment , as well as for bringing road transport to work smoothly , as systems can be used for carrying tolls .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for nearly one third of the budget , the problem remains that this is the only budgetary area where the estimated error rate exceeds 5 % .
I would , of course , also like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report which has received the majority behind it .
I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposal for how to exit the crisis and develop a green economy - in other words , energy , broadband and innovation - aims to allow capital to expand its activities to new profitable areas , not to protect the environment or to protect grassroots interests .
I therefore share your concerns that you expressed that such important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency can be distorted by national debates or properties rather than by what unites us .
I agree with the conditional payment of costs based on prior authorisation in justified and carefully defined cases , when cross-border healthcare includes at least one night that in hospital for a patient and requires highly specialised and costly medical equipment , or if there is a particular risk for the patient or the population in general .
The most important way we can lead is to have been and is still to set ourselves a more stringent target for a reduction in emissions of at least 30 % .
Agriculture is damaging , especially to those actors who are really trying to reduce their environmental impact .
Of course , previous visa scandals show the distressing approach that some states are using in issuing visas .
The poor population in rural areas , with the greatest need for funding , is again left alone .
I know that you have the capacity to rise to these challenges .
- Mr President of the Czech Republic , I warmly welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr Orbán has not presented himself to the European Parliament &apos;s political groups as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; which strikes populist and nationalistic tons and which is supposed to &apos; protect the Hungarian people &apos; from attacks .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I am in favour of the report and I would like to congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to build nuclear weapons .
I am completely opposed to the idea of US bombing and against NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for a stable Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , the Garriga Polledo report is a very important document enabling us to establish a new financial framework for a competitive and sustainable Europe for everyone .
In this context , we intend to create the conditions for making the fisheries sector genuinely sustainable and long-term developable .
There is no doubt that living conditions are tough in the beautiful Arctic area , but there is also no doubt that new technologies and new progress will inevitably open up a greater use of natural resources ; fishing is an important example .
Due to the economic crisis , youth unemployment reached 20 % at the beginning of the year , while the school dropout rate reached 17 % , especially young people in rural areas are affected .
Today , in the market , there is an enormous variety of labels , pictures and texts relating to the environment , which may be confusing to consumers , from images of forests on the streets containing hazardous substances to claims that food is climate-neutral , even ecological ones .
We opposed this proposal because it places responsibility on European countries for the difficult situation in the undeveloped Third World , rather than putting this responsibility on these countries themselves .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking up everyone &apos;s time and delaying the lunchen , but I do it only once every ten years and perhaps you can be lenient about it .
This is a fine task , a job that needs to change the conditions for the better , and she simply does not have enough experience .
Just last year , we agreed to remove those rules and , while customers have not noticed any great difference , our producers have done so and are still doing so .
I do not believe that the proposals contained in the package are ambitious enough , because they are only aimed at austerity measures and restrictions on citizens &apos; social rights .
We cannot allow the agricultural budget to be cut , because that would mean that agriculture is probably less worth Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of this huge plant , which has been included in the economic calculations , entails huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the submitted proposal .
Er Excellency Valdis Zatlers , the President of the Republic of Latvia , we are all very happy to welcome you today to your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the dramatic situation resolved itself .
When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration can cross and there is a readmission agreement - which is the objective - thus strengthening the EU agreement with third countries , which is the overarching approach and the idea behind the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum - then strengthens the borders of EU Member States .
We regret that the report does not fully accept our proposal , but we welcome the fact that its conclusion is very close to our own .
Given that the promotion of a more competitive agricultural system in a transparent environment for global trade is one of the tasks that President Barroso has assigned to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I would like to ask , when the Commissioner is present in this House , how he sees cooperation with his fellow Member who is also responsible for agriculture in finalising the negotiations as part of the Doha Round .
The report proposes simplifying financial surveillance and verification and strengthening the technical and scientific assessment based on excellence .
The proposals that have been made here today should be examined , analysed and , of course , analysed in this context .
It is also necessary to point out the legal and administrative barriers ( legal personnel , financial rules and , in some cases , intellectual property rights ) , which can discourage a large number of important research actors and small and medium-sized enterprises from participating .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will reconsider Directive 2007 / 52 / EC , given the aspects that have just been tabled .
That is why I also voted in favour of regulations that emphasise corporate social responsibility .
We are now seeing that , with regard to the new point that we have developed together , that is , the issue of transparency , progress has not progressed very quickly , and the opportunities opened up by the new regulations on access to documents for those who run infringement proceedings , or ask that they be initiated , to find out why procedures have been closed or brought , are now in any way limited .
Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that this is not the first time that we in this House - which , unfortunately , is always half-empty at this time - have debated the appalling human rights situation in Burma .
The task of society is therefore to act in such a way that women and men can choose freely between the two logical options , both of which are eligible when they are viewed from a broader perspective than the labour market alone .
At present , consumption of products is being promoted with a partial reduction in nutritional value , which is making the situation of thousands of livestock farmers who are unable to market their products in a country producing 50 % of what is needed .
The full impact of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business activities cannot yet be assessed .
In the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is perhaps more important than ever .
Fossil fuels bring centralised , hierarchal and inflexible energy distribution .
I share here the views of my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union has reached half-time and it is therefore worth examining what has been achieved so far .
I believe that the review of the first railway package must identify the problems that the Member States that have justified opinions of the Commission , as well as demonstrate a method for resolving them .
Israel does not realise that such a powerful military response gives rise to new potential suicide bombs and invites new Kassamo rockets at the first opportunity .
The authorities in Burma have chosen to ignore the protests against the imprisonment and calls to release Aung San Suu Kyi from a large number of countries and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , the ASEAN President and several of the Member States of the ASEAN , an organisation in which Burma is actually a member .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , has pointed out to us that the guarantees of EIB activities in the context of the EU budget amounted to almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009 , which is very much for the EU , and therefore , in my opinion , Parliament has every reason to expect a declaration of the risks linked to this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but I would now like to know , on behalf of Timo Soini , where the information about the project is available to the citizens of all countries around the Baltic Sea needs to take part in before the start of its work .
If it were not for the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would never have been off .
I think that an information campaign on this issue is very important .
Since 1999 , Serbia has not , in fact , been able to provide any checks on identity documents held by persons from Kosovo .
Action has been taken and clear and clear rules have been introduced in this area as well .
Does they want to have the vision of a federalised European Union United States , as proposed by Mr Corbett , or a more obscene for a Europe of free trade , which my party supports ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Patrizia Toia , for the quality of her report that she is presenting today .
It is not impunity - impunity is continuing as it has been for many years to come .
It is rare to meet a person who unites so many good characteristics in itself .
I am convinced that everyone in Slovenia would authorise such a stress test to be carried out immediately in Krško .
It does not augur well that some Member States do not want the Employment Summit on Thursday .
We have seen that much has been done to meet the criteria , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet the requirements as soon as possible .
It testifies to a very cynical approach that , in such circumstances , when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , the Moldovan Government is forcing the population to finance such unsafe European programmes and agencies as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky ATM ( SESAR ) programme .
This means that we kill two birds with one stone , because this infrastructure can stimulate the European economy and create jobs , while mitigating the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Channel to Mansijsk , we agreed that our common objective is to conclude a strategic agreement that provides a broad framework for relations between the EU and Russia in the foreseeable future and contributes to developing the potential of our relations .
It is now clear that we are still not doing as much as we should in the Mediterranean and , in particular , in Libya : we need to think a little more and realise that perhaps we need to take more vigorous action to understand what has happened and to launch a coordinated effort in the Mediterranean .
A prerequisite for the comprehensive EU funding of this railway path was that the project was supported by the local population and that there was funding from private Italian investors .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , the reports on the accession process were published in the Balkan countries .
That is why we have also abstained from the vote on the proposals made by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on issues relating to the TV1 in Portugal , although the Portuguese Communist Party is well known to be critical of this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development proposed a reporting system that deals with each country on its own , so that transnational companies must report on each country individually .
One important issue raised in the report is the problem of prostitution and the trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to the completion of the mission , although Mladić and Hadžić are in detention and sentenced , the work of the Tribunal will not be completed .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the compensation targeted at the responsible companies of the deceived farmers , who did not know whether they were poisoning their own animals .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve European energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find solutions , we need to use the same approach in the future .
However , you know that our message concerns structural reforms , which are absolutely crucial to increasing Europe &apos;s growth potential and creating jobs .
This partnership can be very important , especially during the current global financial crisis , and open up greater opportunities for commercial , scientific and technical exchanges that will enable us to emerge from the crisis stronger and more stable .
We can no longer tolerate this paralysis of action .
Approval and the subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have brought increased responsibility to the European Parliament , with the administrative burdens that entail .
In this unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , we must do everything to ensure that the number of unemployed or poor workers in Europe does not reach 25 million in 2010 .
I would like to emphasise once again the importance of a written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other Members of the European Parliament and which half of the European Parliament approved by a majority of the vote , aimed at consolidating the Council and the Commission legislation that is truly effective in the fight against corruption .
Mr President , President of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports your programme of activities in Parliament over the next five years .
Let them , in the name of democracy , implement these promises !
We believe that this is exactly the kind of dialogue that can help these countries , especially by involving civil society .
As a socialist , I do not think that in the conditions prevailing in Sri Lanka , the Tamil people have a right to defend themselves against military repression .
It is time to promote simpler and cheaper measures for small and medium-sized enterprises , which will , of course , lead to more jobs and more growth .
In the fight against this phenomenon , it is very important to approve uniform security measures in the EU , including in the area of package rebation .
When we talk about collective redress , the US and US experience and exaggeration always come up .
The rapid entry into force of the extradition and legal assistance agreement of the EU and the US would help to strengthen judicial cooperation and would also eliminate the grey zone that made possible the flights with extraordinary extradition .
I have three proposals and would emphatically ask for support for them .
The European Court of Justice has already been asked on several occasions to decide in individual cases whether a sport activity is a service of purely social benefit or whether , on the contrary , it also includes economic aspects that mean that it is a service of general economic interest .
In my opinion , the protection of European citizens is the top priority in this institution , and this must be said to citizens .
Time will show whether it will be a marginal issue or whether the unquestionable positive effects of the directive will take an overview .
By modernising transport logistics and promoting co-modality , that is , combining different modes of transport in the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase prosperity in the Baltic Sea region .
It should be up to the Member States to decide in democratic order whether or not they want to ratify the present ILO Convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the monthly minimum income was between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the final document will not be so bad .
Copenhagen was disappointing in many respects .
We ask international aid donors , both state and non-governmental , to stop their activities in certain areas if the bill is passed .
This is a barrier to legal protection of individual rights and an aspect that we need to discuss again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Today , Václav Havel told us that the EU is our home countries .
So , if I were to address a Hungarian police officer , he must respond in Slovak , even though Hungarian is his mother tongue and whatever the fact that I am not going to understand what he says .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like once again to draw attention to an aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the area of police work and justice that has already been mentioned , specifically the transfer of SWIFT data to the United States of America .
In 2009 , we noted an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection , both in individual EU states and in the new development economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency has not been taken seriously , either by the Commission or by the Council .
Finally , in the political field , it is important that we align ourselves with the ACP states within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
We must do something else .
Insofar as we can help bring about a abandoned orphaned child with a family longing for children , we have made a huge contribution .
Therefore , I would like , above all , to say how necessary it is , as an important step towards making the Europe 2020 strategy a success , that the various European institutions end competition with each other and that we are working seriously together with the instruments that we are able to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU &apos;s humanitarian aid strategy .
The horrific events in Gaza should also force us to consider Gaza from a more strategic and long-term perspective .
It is necessary to develop other indicators that can help to explain the factors that affect a country &apos;s standard of living .
Medicine experts believe that opening up treatment with the right medicine can postpone the need to move to a costly care home for up to a year .
Mr Tajani , Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship , has committed himself to examining the losses in this sector .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions by which it wants to implement Council Decision 6 April 2009 .
Tomorrow &apos;s vote is very much a vote on the position of the European Parliament .
In a worrying world and in times of economic and financial crisis , the European Union is being called upon to strengthen its strategic independence and safeguard its values and interests , as well as to protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by gathering its capacity and resources for an adequate response to these challenges and threats , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
This is a good opportunity in contacts between the two sides , and the results of the current global agreement are good .
The common register will be a step towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which hopefully will contribute to greater legitimacy for the European project in the eyes of citizens .
I propose that you review the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
If we are to tackle this problem successfully , such actions must also be accompanied by strong and determined policies .
Mrs Ronzulli , this is the last time I say .
I would like to see exceptions granted either by a clear time limit or by established benchmarks , regardless of how they are structured , and perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to put forward to partially accommodate India &apos;s demands .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I actually heard the Italian Prime Minister held to account for everything but because tens of thousands of people have work thanks to his entrepreneurship .
Of course , if it is appropriate or not , it is an issue that should be decided by Parliament itself .
The purpose of this report is therefore to emphasise the importance of an unknown programme , while calling for amendments : to change the overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the poor success of this programme , which is too incomprehensible for small and medium-sized enterprises , at a time when they play an important role in transforming research results into products and services , in ensuring better cooperation and coordination between national stakeholders .
However , it is the case that the ECB is not independent in the crisis of Greece ; it has chosen to side .
This will not make our industries uncompetitive .
He called for a global ban on so-called &apos; naked scorn &apos; .
Statistics show that every year , cardiovascular diseases cause some 4.3 million deaths in the EU and more than 1.7 million people die in cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective public health measure to protect Europeans against contagious diseases , but it is also important that healthcare reaches developing countries to help increase life expectancy and combat poverty .
Therefore , we must state clearly that the use of the new rules introduced by the banks in the euro area is thus increasing their profits at the expense of our citizens .
In this economic situation , and particularly here in the European Parliament , we must definitely ensure that the expenditure is kept under control .
I therefore believe that strengthening the protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is fundamental to European competitiveness .
Al Hassani has played a very important role in monitoring all trials at the Supreme State Security Court and carried out regular assessments of the conditions in Syrian prisons .
We need a European strategy to counter natural disasters and improve consistency and coordination between the various Community instruments .
At that time , it appeared as if each new Member State were to observe the fundamental principles of the European Union and ban discrimination , as well as protect and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
It is not only financial credit that has decreased , but also social ones .
These new measures would make it possible to help European citizens and businesses assert their rights , particularly with regard to the recognition of qualifications and their social and civil rights .
The issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not an isolated issue .
In these conclusions , the Council is calling on the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to drawing up , if appropriate , a proposal for a European legislation on bio-degradable waste in 2010 .
This is the case : may it be the case that , in the first days after the child arrived in the family , he has the right to participate in every respect .
These intentions deserve to be appreciated and not criticised , even if that is not the main point here .
In fact , we in Europe must put an end to our total dependence on Russian energy .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 11th largest trading and trade relationship between the European Union and Canada , accounting for 1.6 % of the total foreign trade in the European Union in 2010 .
I would first like to point out that the rapporteur who introduced this in our Rules of Procedure was Mrs Renault , not .
The country &apos;s own fishing sector is still completely undeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing four reports in today &apos;s debate , and I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the European Commission for their cooperation .
I agree that the summit is an important opportunity .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage - I am referring here in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comment - which will apply in a uniform and non-bureaucratic manner throughout the European Union , without touching the cooperation that exists between the Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama has said that Chinese representatives are welcome to scrutinise documents in the archives of his government in exile in order to ensure he did not go to violence himself .
The initiative is their answers to the question that retains their development and their integration into our global world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day we are witnessing many demagogic claims in the media and here in the European Parliament which have no technical basis whatsoever .
Since human rights are the most important issue of the EU-Pakistan agreement , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must also depend on Pakistan respecting human rights .
I voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings because it will have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , with its direct impact on the buildings they live in and use .
Amendment 9 expresses an unacceptable position that , albeit for a limited period of time , it should deviate from the principles underpinning the European Union , including the four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not agree that it is acceptable for Parliament to use it as a reason to demand a larger budget .
It is finally time to put an end to this unilateral US privilege .
To Mr Dalli and the Commission , I would like to say that I would be pleased , now that we have this directive , if you could carry out a closer examination of the regulation of social security , which is the system based on everything else , and where it is clear who receives payment and where everything is well organised .
Let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way to preserve and protect the Arctic for future generations .
In my opinion , there was a great need for this , and it is a good example of the European Parliament &apos;s efforts to shape the budget , where funds are used which , we can say , cannot be used in other areas .
Let us now think about hypotheses .
In order for this to be possible , we need to take all possible steps to limit energy intensity in all sectors of the economy .
In such sensitive areas as clothing , leather and furniture , it is for the companies that have decided to maintain production in Europe and preserve European knowledge and European jobs , a very important issue to create opportunities for consumers to make a conscious choice .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has been unable to put an end to this extremely destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument that promotes enhanced relations with third countries and brings with them some concrete benefits .
Furthermore , it is not just a question of you .
In this case , the Commission is not only right , but it is also obliged to state its position .
However , with this proposal , we have broken that obstacle and we have done so because we need to take care of patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of the proposals and is of urgent importance .
I believe that all patients are entitled to high quality care and care provided by staff who speak their language , close to their home and their family .
Therefore , when we speak in this Chamber , we need to use the terms that have all been approved and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the candidate country has been approved as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , not as Macedonia .
This is something attainable and it would be looking for better results .
What has happened recently in the European economy , not least in the case of Greece , has shown that strengthening European economic governance is absolutely necessary and urgent .
Their donors Stuart Wheeler , who does not want to be overmet , have said that it costs GBP 120 billion per year , which is approximately 36 times the real figure .
This dual approach towards Belarus - &apos; carrot and stick &apos; , which I think Mr Tannock called it - is , I hope , the one that will succeed .
We can talk for hours about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation , yes , what you want , but I think the important thing is that we have this fundamental agreement in the three reports that have been presented today on what we have done in recent times .
Secondly , he also said that the Commission will start discussing the issue of Eurobonds - at last , I can say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
It is not the sort of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Business and small and medium-sized enterprises
Under this regulation , tyre suppliers have to use labels and coffers to inform users of fuel consumption and resistance to driving , wet grip and external noise levels .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In this attempt to achieve bolder and more far-reaching results , I also believe that , during the COP 16 final phase of the negotiations , the European Union should give its main negotiator some freedom to react to further developments that may emerge during the negotiations .
That is why balanced and clear measures are needed , because the confidence of the entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for the success of the project .
The problem of the disastrous impact of the massive urbanisation mechanism on the environment , especially in coastal areas and in Spanish islands , but also in other areas , such as around Madrid .
It is important that the special representative of Central Asia follows the situation and work closely with the High Representative / Vice-President of the Commission .
These processes should include necessary maintenance and control following closure , waste management , storage , storage and decontamination , with particular importance to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is my opinion .
I come from a country where , when going to the supermarket , I always see a man on a moped with a narrow in the luxury .
For example , there was a separate discussion on stock sales in developing countries and countries that do not have arable land buying them , and I think that this is a very interesting topic of discussion and that we should be able to agree on this .
Without a European network , the European Union &apos;s main objectives cannot be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco grows in 17 out of the 27 Member States with subsidies from the governments of the Member States are , in any case .
One of the three , namely English , French or German , will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout Europe .
This is a very controversial issue in Ireland and a welcome contribution for those who advocate a &apos; no &apos; to the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency did its utmost to reach an agreement , but it finally assessed that the issue must be decided by the European Council .
While Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that we have different opinions from time to time .
That is how the Commission will work .
However , this may have been a one-off shop as a result of the transfer to the agency &apos;s final office .
The proposed amendments will also allow less developed Member States , including Romania , to be eligible for EGF assistance .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all parts of this House pay tribute to the Belgian Presidency and rightly so .
I do not need to emphasise the importance of both these points in the current situation .
We will work together to conclude the Doha Round with a good outcome in 2010 , because that is very important in the process of promoting recovery and combating protectionism .
Today is a little special day for me : after 10 years of long and faithful service , this is my last sitting as President of Brussels .
The proposal that these delegations adopt certain consular data , such as the management of Schengen visas , is interesting from the point of view of effectiveness .
We appeared to have spent a lot of time discussing with each other rather than discussing continually with others , and in the end we were completely crushed .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s proposal needs to be more substantiated and that Parliament should therefore take more time to make its decision .
Perhaps there are plans to go further , but that is what is on the table at the moment .
All Member States would have found themselves in a much more difficult situation without the EU and its protective shield .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in terms of public education , reducing poverty and increasing access to safe drinking water .
President Barroso was here this morning with the Treaty of Lisbon in his hand and said that it is the Commission who is standing for the EU &apos;s voice on environmental issues .
Opinions can be expressed , you may be allowed to be divided and even eurosceptics may be allowed to give their say , but the end result must be the same .
Mr Lukashenko , who is a clever political player , has been able to take advantage of his campaign and has enjoyed all political and economic benefits while continuing to muddle democracy and human rights .
According to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia were hoping to negotiate and conclude local border agreements between Russia and Russia with neighbouring Member States of the European Union showing interest in this .
This is crucial for the future well-being of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself talked about gaps that still need to be closed in the implementation of our legislation in a number of Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens , with respect .
Hamas and other armed Palestinian communities must realise that the people of Southern Israel have the right to live without being bombed .
We must do everything we can to ensure proper recovery of this waste , not only in order to prevent damage to the environment and health , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I cannot help but remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still the subject of an international arrest warrant , a fact ignored by the authorities of that country .
Fifthly , President Barroso wrote in December 2008 as Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs , Mr Gargani , described in detail the performance of the pilot project and confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to submit an in-depth report to Parliament on the first year of the project .
Mr President , I expect you to answer this with an addition .
As far as the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal is essentially sensible as it deals with the ban on and the gradual replacement of products with serious harmful effects on human health .
The purpose of the proposal for a decision is to establish fishing opportunities for EU vessels on the basis of the available surplus in stocks , as well as the financial contribution to be paid separately for access rights and sectoral support .
We in the European Union must provide all possible support to the new Tunisian unity government and also provide all possible support to European citizens , including British citizens , who are stranded after being in Tunisia on holiday .
Honourable Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe that it is right and proper for the island of Taiwan to be moved over to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional means of communication often fail , due to commercial interests , or because their management is a certain political environment and indirectly incumbent on their workers to apply their own censorship .
We cannot live side by side in the European Union as long as this situation continues , and therefore we believe that it is very important that the Commission , the authorities within the European Union and everyone else we put forward proposals along the same lines to bring this to an end .
This is one thing , and I will also keep an eye on a number of social , environmental and economic criteria , because I am in favour of evaluating all the laws in advance .
That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and 10th European Development Fund ( EDF ) budget for the financial year 2008 .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are discussing Belarus here in the European Parliament , but it is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support and speak in favour of the proposal .
Then I am very pleased that East Jerusalem could become the capital of the future Palestinian state , or the Jerusalem of the two states .
The third lesson we can learn is that the EU must be safeguarded .
However , there are also great differences between regions in the same Member State .

I look forward to hearing your answers .
The preliminary result of the referendum in the 10 southern states was announced on 30 January , showing an overwhelming majority ( 9.5 % ) for expiry .
Personally , I believe that Europe needs a common energy policy so that it can avoid excessive dependence on resources from one area .
The FVO also found huge shortcomings in the traceability system applied by Brazil and demonstrated problems with many parties in transit to the EU that had no necessary certification .
These committees will now take the floor in turn .
That is why I believe that the key question now is : how and what can we do as a continuation of the Swedish Presidency &apos;s efforts ?
Europe &apos;s role must be strengthened as a result of this crisis .
The key thing in this proposal is that it underlines the fact that dialogue is a reciprocal one , that the views expressed must be taken into account and respected .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore Polish names in streets and towns in areas where most people belong to the Polish minority .
Since all these measures are intrinsically and consistently linked to the level of ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result as soon as possible in line with citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of this report because it represents a significant improvement in relation to the current situation .
In view of this , I voted in favour .
The report aims to increase the risk viability , reduce supervision mechanisms and boost the confidence of researchers and businesses .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I agree with Mr Daul &apos;s statement .
The resolution adopted today highlights that the establishment of a common register guarantees the widest possible participation of the various categories of stakeholders while respecting their differences and specific identities .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to put a question to the President of the Commission , who has sat and looked at the images we have received from the Mediterranean over the last few weeks , for people fleeing unrest in Africa , many of whom are able to come to Europe , but some are failing .
However , this is not the case , as we have a sad example in Lampedusa .
Israel bombs and decimates a ghetto .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from their experience .
in writing . - The issue of the common agricultural policy and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
It must be a partnership based on respect for each other , for our common commitments and also for the values that the European Union stands for in terms of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and provides a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this regard , we in the ALDE Group have tabled an amendment , not only with reference to the European Union , but we are , of course , also looking to the United States , in which we call for all forms of export subsidies to be banned completely and immediately .
Most of those who contributed highlight the necessity to transform the CAP into , or concentrate on , the competitiveness of European agriculture , sensitivity to climate change , food security and quality requirements , as well as other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations on the EU-Central America agreement should be concluded before the Madrid Summit taking place in May .
The next item is the joint debate on :
It is , of course , extremely important for the European Union to step up its special support for cities : there is the greatest economic and financial potential here , because cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will not be officially submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control until next week .
Considerable financial resources are required to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gases , as the scientists recommend , and to curb the decline in biodiversity .
Only the carrot and stick that form the central dynamics of the accession process can make the countries &apos; governments focus on implementing the work and the reforms that can once and for all cementing stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I would like to focus on two of them , which are particularly relevant .
With regard to the legal certainty of all persons involved , we must have the same rights across Europe for those who are accused of defamation , and mandatory information on these rights must be provided .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy are a national matter , which is why we voted against all of the reports on this issue .
I refer to Article D , so you know Mr Weber .
I also appreciate the positive assessment in the motion for a resolution of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos;s ongoing efforts to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened a few hours ago today in Greece will not spread , and I hope that it will be the beginning of a joint fight to shape European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have been in touch with people who are in Tunisia and with the people of Egypt , with our delegations , whom I praise for what they had to do over the last few weeks , and we have also been in direct contact with the government and its services .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument is even more important in the light of the financial crisis , as it can help businesses to recover more quickly and in future can constitute a pilot project for establishing a major energy fund .
These inspections were flawed .
Then we will be able to make a major contribution from Europe , but it cannot be an imminent brother .
I supported the special report from the European Ombudsman to Parliament on the draft recommendation to the European Commission complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , concerning the Commission &apos;s much delayed response to the Ombudsman .
The greatest progress of this directive , compared to existing legislation , is that patients can choose carers and will have access to information about the quality and safety of the care they will receive .
I would like to point out once again that we must call on the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly and to review the regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund , with a view to adapting them to the needs of the tragedy .
I realise that , following consultations with consumer organisations and business representatives , we need to strive for even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the EU .
I have said that everyone asking questions is the residents of this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and obligation to monitor the negotiations - in this case , trade negotiations - and to intervene politically with the means at its disposal , such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , in order to keep informed of the progress of negotiations .
Neither citizens &apos; investments in social cohesion nor intergenerational solidarity are recognised .
However , the really important reform is about admissibility .
This is one of the most serious problems concerning human rights in the European Union today .
In order to do this , adequate financial resources are required to allow the EU to take action and to find new avenues to global competitiveness .
In many European countries , public authorities are known to pay late and very often cause bankruptcy for companies when they are in difficulty .
The G20 conference , too , made the abolition of tax havens one of its main objectives .
There is no such reaction from the political class .
However , the United States is imposing a huge burden of debt , allowing the world to finance the lifestyle of the Americans , which will make it increasingly uncertain whether the world &apos;s most important economic superpower is to meet its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures to combat and defeat those who want to destroy it .
One telling example is Iceland , which , when it was a rich country , had no interest in joining the EU .
Mr Vice-President , this is not a new thing for you .
This is an excellent means of promoting sustainable development and involving everyone in ensuring strong local acceptance .
However , it is a problem which will export the fight against international terrorism to the surrounding countries and regions as long as the fight in Afghanistan continues .
We must fight against fragmentation , and that is why I call on Commissioner Andor to ensure that the European Social Fund remains intact in the regulations and is not split up , as sometimes proposed here in Parliament .
It is , of course , in the essence that we do not get everything we want in a compromise .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for their constructive attitude throughout the budget procedure , which also demonstrates the very good cooperation we have had during this work .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The Socialist Group cannot stand unmoved to the recent murder of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to emphasise that the negotiations are not foreseen , which would pave the way for more realistic alternatives as preferential partnerships .
It is therefore , first and foremost , an American problem that Washington needs to resolve .
Let me also say that we should carry out reform to make European universities more independent and more European , open to students and researchers and to make dynamic development in the knowledge society .
The quotas they purchase can be retained in the national reserve and allocated at a later stage , if the Member States so wish .
I therefore ask once again , on 25 May , the day he was executed , to be appointed as an international day for the heroes of the fight against totalitarian systems , because many unknown people , like Pilecki , have lost their lives in the fight against fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be remembered .
Let me briefly mention what we have done .
If this were to be the majority position of the European Union in the next parliamentary term , it would destroy the highly funded peace plan established after the Balkan Empire .
I very much hope that these amendments will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want EMAS to compete with the ISO , but because I believe that it is a good programme that can help us meet our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , this is a very important vote to be held tomorrow .
We must no longer find ourselves in the dumping of exchange rates , with the social consequences of this .
This aspect is crucial to ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
By setting out best practice based on the experiences of the Member States and respecting fundamental standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment , as well as protection from direct and indirect expropriation , we will have a basis for coherent European policies on this issue .
I am aware that during public consultations on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep meat sector were in favour of mandatory origin labelling .
I am very aware of the complexity of this issue .
Although most countries are facing a number of economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to ending the negative effects of climate change .
I would ask for your support here .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will give rise to a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the system of own resources .
Thus , the overall competence of these measures has been extended .
Like the European Parliament , the Commission has the right to opinions on the audit process .
For example , the levels of responsibility in France and Spain are considered to be &apos; suspect low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council lifted until 2003 the further measures .
They are interested in solutions and want to know whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to create a network for statistical exchange in the Member States as well as a platform for coordinating research into the causes of Alzheimer &apos;s disease and how it can be prevented and treated .
I also agree with what many in this House have said , namely that the greater the solidarity of the EU is the better the relationship between the EU and Russia .
Syria has much left to do with regard to freedom of expression and association .
Much remains to be done before we can guarantee women fair access to the labour market .
As I said , the proposals need to be reviewed in order to take the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon into account .
The following amendments have been proposed :
We are fully aware that the situation of milk farmers is untenable .
I supported this report because I particularly want to emphasise a threat it raises : the lack of sound and comprehensive information for consumers on health characteristics , composition and origin of particular species of fish .
After all , history is repeating itself with examples of intervention by Western countries that have done more harm than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that the proposal is completely ineffective and cannot contribute to preventing crime , and for a number of reasons .
The Palestinian agreement is an important political event , contrary to what has just been said here , Hamas , for the first time , has accepted the operation of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority as its negotiating partner .
The countries love and negotiate how to divide the sea seeds .
The last thing is particularly important given the energy infrastructure problems that ...
In other words , it is precisely the institution that is supposed to protect us from criminals ( indirectly through training of police officers ) who are sitting on their benches .
However , the fact that Fidel Castro has surrendered power to his bridge , Raúl , has neither led to democratic reform nor the release of political prisoners .
The energy mix will also be indicated in any advertising that includes information on energy consumption or on product prices .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are all aware of the principles of consensurement from Washington : they loved ones .
In this way , we could respond effectively to the real conditions on the ground , as Frontex is already doing in any case .
I would like to conclude by once again thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked together with the Czech Presidency on this issue , and I appreciate the support we have received from the Presidency in our efforts to find a sustainable way forward .
In particular , Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the deterioration of the private sector makes him particularly capable of maintaining the balance between EU legislation and the specific requirements of the market and EU citizens .
Until now , the conflict has claimed 1 000 lives over 17 days .
This type of measure must be taken to reduce the number of falsified medicinal products and make them safer .
We also need to learn lessons from the OLAF - it is not too late to initiate a coordinated European strategy for the car industry .
We did this because President Obama and I do not believe , like you , that you have to choose between security and our ideals .
Unfortunately , the pact for the euro will be permanent this restraint .
Recently , a new attempt was opened at Manchesters &apos; airport , and legal advice has now shown that the use of such machines in minors can constitute a crime against children &apos;s safety and against child protection as a result of the nature of the images that are produced .
Moreover , this money is not going straight to the artists .
In the area of civil aviation , development of the system and the use of EGNOS &apos;s application of landing exercises should be supported .
Common rules and standards for organisations carrying out inspections and monitoring of ships and the activities of maritime administrations in conjunction ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) - Review of Hamnaval State monitoring ( recast ) - Transparency and information system for maritime transport in the Community - Requirements &apos; case of maritime transport accidents - Railway transport carriers - Railway transport in the case of passengers &apos; accidents - Railway in the case of maritime transport accidents ( recast ) - Railway transport carriers - Rail of passengers &apos; liability for passengers - Railway transport transport transport in the case - Railed in the case of passengers &apos; transport transport transport transport transport transport accidents ( transport transport transport transport accidents ( transport transport transport transport .
I am voting in favour of the report on creating a new microfinance facility which will help people at risk of losing their jobs in setting up or developing micro-enterprises .
It is important that we have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , which I fully support , and I believe that this report will make it possible to better define the legal framework for cities and put in place tools such as municipal operational programmes , which will provide cohesion policy with new quality .
During the negotiations at the trilogues , I was made clear that the improvements that I tabled on behalf of Parliament are very important for fair and efficient energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is of the utmost importance that self-employed workers be supported and encouraged .
In other words , one does not need to ask Brussels for these instruments .
For us in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and for us in Europe , it is clear that energy has become a foreign policy tool , an instrument that can trigger conflict or unify us ; it is precisely this subject that we want to talk about today .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report because the food programme under consideration is a key instrument for helping the most deprived people , who are suffering greatly in the current financial crisis , even in terms of meeting basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all the EU Member States , have at least one officially supported export credit agency and , overall , represent the world &apos;s largest source of state funding for private sector projects .
That is why we are not voting in favour of this report .
By taking this position , we helped to bring this joint government to a standstill .
By setting up Conseil français you drew up the musulman in 2003 , the then Interior Minister , Nicolas Sarkozy , has introduced Islam in the French institutions .
On this issue , I have already asked the Commission to issue an opinion and to consider the possibility of creating specific programmes to create equal opportunities for women in science .
We will continue this fight to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and the unrestricted access of end users to services .
Europe &apos;s great politicians and thinkers understood full well that the strength that could unite Europe was a common approach to economic problems .
The borders between freedom and security do not end at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , as of this summer , the Commission will take a leading role in coordinating the strategy with regard to development in key areas such as the promotion of social education , career guidance and employment .
Costs will be paid by the country of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for stability in the region .
We can therefore expect that a reactor disaster will occur every twenty-five years .
In my opinion , this extended eligibility for housing cofinanced by the ERDF should make us consider other development opportunities , in the medium and long term , which may be financing eligibility for funding or earmarking funds to certain strategic priorities .
Today is again the time to talk about violations of religious rights in these two countries , but this time it is Christians .
Climate change is one of the biggest threats our world faces .
As I expected , you have placed great emphasis on human rights and on how important it is to ensure that they have a clear place in all our dynamic relations and run like a thread in our work .
I would also like to say that the European Union has no right to do with the regulation of air transport .
However , Europe is not a cradle or cure for the economic crisis .
So I can confirm , on behalf of the rapporteur , the Commission &apos;s already stated intentions in relation to the comitology procedure and the alternative provisions .
I do not think that the warm words that have been spoken here today , not even what the Commission is saying , can change the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya and that we cannot even put an end to the crisis in the cities or in the appearance of Gaddafi .
For this reason , I believe that , if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , it will be very beneficial to Europe &apos;s citizens because they enjoy much greater freedom of choice .
I also hope that the European Council will agree on measures that will reassure the markets and restore stability to the euro area , and that should be in the interests of all of us , whether we are euro countries or not .
Accession aid has proved particularly costly in this regard .
This is a reason for great gratitude and pleasure .
We therefore call on all parties to stop Christian and stop all violence , and we call on the European Union to act accordingly .
outside the world , the European Union is tackling the energy challenge without fail .
The Indian indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in advertising for sales or rental work in the media .
It is vital that we encourage efforts to increase the EU &apos;s investments in measures aimed at increasing the diversification of cross-border structures , stimulate local power production with alternative , non-conventional energy sources , and make it easier to connect alternative energy sources with infrastructure .
A well-developed infrastructure forms the basis for the effective functioning of the internal market , leading to greater internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider creating a tool for rapid action in the European Neighbourhood Policy for immediate and flexible responses to policy changes in partner countries such as those that occurred recently in the Southern Neighbourhood Area .
I find absolutely grotesque that anyone in this House who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission .
The problem , then , is that the only Members listening to you are the ones who do so in the country of origin .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was pleased that the Swedish Presidency stressed issues relating to citizens , our constituents , the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , job preservation and the fight against crime .
The EU budget cannot , as some Members say , be used to complement national budgets in belatedly .
Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Council has not been given any competences by the Treaty to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States .
everything is not as usual .
You can call me cynics , but students do not always get to study and tourists do not always stop at a limited time .
Is the global financial crisis , which became an economic crisis , the cause of the situation , or are we dealing here with our own mistakes , our own omission and lack of action ?
My second &apos; but &apos; has to do with the role played by the Belgian Presidency during the period following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The main objective of these regimes was to keep the territory together in this huge state populated by a variety of people &apos;s peoples .
( PL ) Although many economists and politicians have already declared that the crisis is taking place in Europe , we are still struggling with its negative consequences .
That is generally the case in many areas of Japan , but I acknowledge Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect its risk market , its rises farmers , and to pay its farmers higher prices than the prices of world markets and to say &apos; no &apos; to huge imports that would kill its small farmers , just as I acknowledge the right of our economies to protect certain sectors of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I intend to talk about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
As I have already said to you when we discussed the broader policy guidelines for the next parliamentary term , I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen the social profile .
Therefore , I would like to ask you quite clearly , Commissioner , what action - see that I am using the plural - that the Commission intends , in the short term , to take to address these shortcomings .
That is exactly what has been lacking so far , or what has not been done sufficiently for our citizens .
It does not interest the citizens , and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong message by adopting with a very broad majority the report by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania has supported open-minded policies aimed , in particular , at strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that anything that exists must be done in addition to this too , in order to avoid the consequences of the disaster and to restore the state of life .
I am referring in plain terms not only to accidents at work , which take place quite often , but also to dangerous substances used in labour processes .
In September 2009 , the Council initiated the detailed study of the proposal to amend the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund .
It is now important that we take particular account of Madeira and the outermost regions which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , must now also tackle destroyed infrastructure and destroyed personal property , commercial property and agricultural judgments , and in many cases they cannot return to normal activities immediately .
We have not seen such persistent disturbances in the industry with such huge economic losses since 11 September , but in spite of the economic difficulties that all Member States are currently facing , I call on them to support plans to help an industry that simply does not manage to incur further losses .
At the same time , we must acknowledge that our exposure to risk is also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a comment about language , or perhaps anti-Semester .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
One may have a strong desire for certain things , but it is also important to see the reality .
Consumer organisations want binding measures for national collective redress systems in all Member States , together with other options , such as the extension of existing alternative dispute resolution methods , to include group claims .
The problem is not the tourism Cypriots , as some people claim .
I would like to ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that the horses are slaughtered in their country of origin , without having to go through long and stressing journeys to the countries in which they are supposed to be consumed .
That is what we need to do .
I really wonder where human rights defenders have taken the way , just as we are pleased that the West is secular and pluralistic , and who , in contrast , consider the Middle East to be slowly but surely reserved for an individual religion .
This is being done and we have a dialogue with the authorities of these countries .
Banks that process our money are only worthy of contempt , but , Mr Schulz , those politicians who now let deficits and debt rush up are equally irresponsible to the detriment of younger generations .
I am therefore grateful to the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to deliver .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the instrument for democracy and human rights was a good one and was very cooperative .
We should try to ensure that the programmes proposed offer maximum support to the reforms in these countries , so that they can move closer to the Union .
It is also very important for all Member States to maintain national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information , such as on the availability of healthcare , procedures and requested documentation .
In the past , we saw all the events of the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , but now we are discussing trade in conditions of full freedom for the individual .
Whether this is deemed a private or public fund , this report deals with a very specific issue , namely that Parliament states that it has no legal claim to receive any contributions for its deficits , firstly , and secondly that such contributions to further deficits will not be made .
Their faces must be the most expensive since Helena in Troika left a thousand sceptics .
Support that distorts competition undermines the future of the European car industry and has a negative impact on both employment and technological development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are a few things that I think we need to bear in mind in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard several Members say that we want to see a more robust Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse vote mechanism .
I think it is very important that we remind ourselves of the really important issues here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric ritual , I would like to call on all of you to wear a rose-tinted today as a symbol of our opposition to this practice .
Democratising control is being sidelined , because national governments hide behind the Commission and the troika in basic measures , while the Commission is handing these issues to national governments .
A new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After threats from the Commission on the legal process in the Court of Justice of the European Communities , Sweden has now started to allow deka-BD .
It is clear to those of us who come from constituencies in rural areas and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that the situation that many livestock producers are currently in is completely untenable .
The parties deserve clear information that is easy to understand and readily accessible .
I think it could be our job to support the Chinese people in their efforts to create a harmonious society .
I supported both these mechanisms during the vote because I am convinced that we need to be demanding and ambitious in order to improve the stability of public finances in Europe and to secure our future .
It is also important that anyone who organises an initiative - a social organisation or non-governmental organisation - clearly defines the subject and purpose of initiative , even if there is not necessarily a need to put forward a legislative proposal .
In the Latvian town of Daugpiles , more than 90 % of the population is Russian-speaking .
I welcome Prime Minister Fischer &apos;s apologies and the recent decision of the Czech Government that the Ministry of Health by 31 December 2009 should implement a series of measures to ensure that such abuses do not occur in the future .
I welcomed this report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world .
Now the effects of globalisation have been completely overshadowed by the financial and economic crisis and our considered response will be to adapt the funding conditions of the EGF .
in writing . - ( PT ) The present resolution addresses the declaration of independence of Kosovo , which has been recognised by 69 countries , and encourages the Member States to work together in a common strategy for Kosovo , in the light of the planned accession of Kosovo to the EU .
Compared to the other two institutions , Parliament can still be seen as a lead in transparency , and that is why I would not prioritise it , because , given both access to documents and transparency in the activities of MEPs , we are more transparent than national parliaments .
It was an internal political manoeuvre of Italy &apos;s reform minister , Umberto Bossi .
The statements of the Observatory on Human Rights in Asturias , my own region , and many other organisations , deserve to be taken seriously .
I voted in favour of the Casini report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution on the ban on thrombin from thrombin .
That is why I have chosen to abstain and will follow the ongoing investigation with great attention .
However , the tasks of the European Commission are also not fully appropriate to determine the measures to be taken to punish the Member States that demonstrate the highest level of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say something , given that today is the fifth European Year of the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and emissions by 20 % in sectors not included in the ETS .
Turning to the second question , I can assure you that the Commission is aware that a cross-sector approach is required to get control of the anti-microbial resistance element .
Tomorrow &apos;s tripartite talks give great hope for a final agreement .
Products based on an annual growth rate of around 27 % over the next few years show that this figure will rise to approximately EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adjusted so that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a decision of the Council .
Many people are asking me what ACTA stands for , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because this financial support from the EU will help people who have been victims of globalisation to find jobs , return to the labour market and help them out of the recession .
Given that the Internet is the most important instrument for creating better conditions , development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms , particularly through the broadcasting of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play the main role in the area of radio spectrum and the creation of development and innovative software products .
And to all this , ordinary concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and the European Union can be added , and about the problems that might arise if a country bordering more than 80 million inhabitants became a member of the European Union , and these factors will continue to strengthen my unshakeable conviction that Turkey is not right for joining the European Union .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
( Protests from the House )
It implies a deterioration in environmental and consumer protection , as old , potentially dangerous products with a high level of energy consumption would then be placed on the market once again .
I would like to thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate .
I would like to put on record my thanks to the mayor of the Balkans , to lecturers Helmut Reitemann , and to the municipal council , for giving their permission to this memory in order to commemorate young men .
Thirdly , I am very keen on Mrs Kroes to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we want to be able to be proud of this wonderful flag project in the future .
Anyone who experienced and saw the results of the environmental catastrophe caused by the flawed technology in Baia Mare and the subsequent emissions of toxic cyanide waste in waterways , with far-reaching effects on the fauna in the Tisza River in Hungary and the Danube in Bulgaria , would do everything they could to ensure that nothing similar can ever happen again in Europe .
It is the responsibility of all : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries over EUR 100 billion per year .
Secondly , we have the right of displaced people to return to their homes and property : the basic freedom of movement , as you said , to pass the dividing lines .
I therefore agree with the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject the Commission proposal .
What is important is that we had the courage to convene this summit , that we invited the social partners , that we will prepare the meeting with them in the long term - before the Employment Summit , three round-table conferences will be held in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we will try to reach agreement on conclusions that will be valuable for the June Council .
The European Parliament , at first reading , created a good basis for the proper application of the rules governing cross-border healthcare services in the Member States , in such a way that patients when they were justified and in accordance with the rules in force and without the fact that the courts were burdened with the police or hospital care they needed in another Member State .
This was also proposed in the Barnier report , but we have not yet reached a conclusion in this regard .
There is no time to waste .
With yet another grotesque expulsion in reality , we are again faced with a glaring attempt by the European Parliament to intervene in Venezuela .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a discussion document containing new data , as did the views of various types of users on this issue , we will return to the outcome of this public consultation in a moment .
Thank you for your cooperation .
I would add that when someone is detained , this is what is stipulated in the European Convention on Human Rights .
I hope that the majority will support this amendment tomorrow .
Copenhagen is the basis for further developing the European Union &apos;s positions on these key elements , allowing us to maintain our leadership and help us to lead the negotiations towards success in Copenhagen .
Secondly , at this stage , the Commission cannot provide clear answers to many MEPs &apos; questions and reflections on geographical scope , scope and the existence of Objective 2 regions , suitable funding base , transitional provisions and status of individual groups of regions .
