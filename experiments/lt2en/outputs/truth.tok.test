That means that we have offered the possibility for Belarus to come closer to the European Union through the European Neighbourhood Policy .
I also call on the Council Presidency to make a similar statement to our resolution on this occasion and also in June on the occasion of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
I therefore support the obligation strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights , combat social exclusion and discrimination and to promote social justice and protection .
The EU is like a building under construction and therefore , the notion of halting its enlargement would run counter to the very principle it is based on .
I hope that with today &apos;s vote , the European Parliament contributed at least a little to the conservation of fish stocks and a healthy marine environment , and also to reform of the common fisheries policy .
Firstly , among these parties , I must mention former South African President and President of the African Union , Thabo Mbeki , and the mediation he performed , and I think we should also emphasise the mediation role that our own special representative to Sudan , Rosalind Marsden , has played .
Thank you to the social economy actors who took action and who made it possible for this Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission to finally recognise a single European statute for mutuals , associations and foundations .
Regarding financial markets ; let us talk about financial markets as a part of the economy , not as a separate sector , because we will never get investments and new jobs if we think this is a separate issue .
Elections have been called and candidates are withdrawing , as we are seeing in all the media , because they can see that the democratic conditions do not exist in which to hold elections .
Enterprises that do business within Europe know that , in future , their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days .
( HU ) Mr President , I welcome with gratitude and appreciation the inclusion on the agenda of the protection of traditional national and ethnic minorities as well as of immigrants to Europe .

All in all , I can , however , recommend discharge for the financial year 2008 for the area of the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
Children need to grow up in a safe environment for which parents have the primary responsibility .
We really have to consider utilising the scarce resources which we have in a very active and intelligent way .
So what we did - across the world , not just the United States of America - we built up a mountain of debt .
We do not know what will happen between now and 2020 , and I therefore support this report .
We all remember - and the older ones here remember very well - the issue of asbestos contamination of the Berlaymont building , which was closed for five or six years .
Mr President , it is clear that Kashgar is the symbol , par excellence , of Uyghur cultural identity in the Chinese province of Xinjiang .
Mr President , today &apos;s discussion has been very encouraging from all sides of the House from an agricultural point of view .

Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
However , and I think this is what concerns numerous members , we must be extremely careful as to the methods and means we use in order to provide fast and immediate relief to this vulnerable economic sector .
It is therefore essential that we do not pursue a simple technical revision of the treaties and that the two major dysfunctions of the euro area revealed by the crisis are addressed .
We are therefore proposing a regulation and guidelines which will increase the range of choice and opportunities for small enterprises throughout the whole chain , from the manufacture of spare parts to vehicle repair .
Absolutely .
Today , after the events that took place in Georgia , and after Russia &apos;s recognition of the enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Russia &apos;s preparedness to build a joint security area with the European Union , and the parties &apos; positions in matters concerning Kosovo and the common neighbourhood diverge more than ever .
We have elaborated a common European Union standard in the field of minority rights , and this is an absolute must .
However , surveillance of macro-economic imbalances and competitiveness diversions are particularly warranted for EU Member States that linked to the euro because of the higher degree of economic and financial spillovers across euro area Member States ; less market discipline ; the absence of exchange rate risks and more challenging adjustment with potentially high cost for the euro area as a whole .
For my country , and especially for the citizens affected , it is important that this decision be approved by the European Parliament .
It is not enough to simply add the word &apos; solidarity &apos; by way of an amendment in order to make this European energy policy acceptable when , moreover , the very same amendment prohibits the EU from intervening in the operation of the market .
The goal is to do away with the practice , common in the railway sector , of resorting to national standards to obstruct the approval of rolling stock already approved by other States .
But already now we can conclude that racism and xenophobia are still persistent phenomena in the European Union and that they affect the lives of members of ethnic minorities .
That means if we have loopholes in the system in terms of consumer protection and if we want to have a high standard of consumer protection for people in Europe , then we need a revision of this Package Travel Directive and we must also consider whether is it necessary - as my fellow Member has already mentioned - to have a special regulation for air passengers .
Despite the many achievements of medicine , the spread of cancer in the world today is nevertheless very much on an epidemic scale .
According to recent reports in the magazine Stern , at least 76 German MEPs were members of this fund .
Commissioner , I also wanted to have a say on other reports but I was not given the floor .
And we also need a very serious information campaign sponsored by the European Union .
It will not surprise you to learn that I am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements .
We need to create a proper framework for our contractual relations , yet the Trade and Cooperation Agreement currently in force , being so limited , does not allow for that .
On the other hand , however , I also see the glass half empty , because with regard to the common agricultural policy , it makes plenty of references to the public goods and services that agriculture must produce for people but very few to primary agricultural production and the competitiveness of the sector .
While I am keen to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and all those affected , and my support for local councillors , I would like to take advantage of this forum to call on the European Community since , it has to be said , this kind of situation requires a European response and , first and foremost , European solidarity .
I expect my comments on the reports and their conclusions will be relatively brief .
( BG ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Bulgarian public has recently witnessed a series of publications about the use of special surveillance equipment to eavesdrop on people in high government positions .
The only thing that can prevent the influx into Europe of the least educated and most needy migrants looking for their place in the world is a well thought-out and coherent migration policy , as previous speakers have mentioned , such as those operated by Canada and New Zealand .

Written statements ( Rule 149 )
In order to promote stability among its eastern neighbours and minimise the impact on Member States , the EU must adopt a tough policy towards Russia , which should be drafted in close cooperation with transatlantic partners and include the relevant multilateral organisations , as well as the OSCE .
We can make it succeed , so let us all - Parliament , Commission , Council and the European Central Bank - put our heads together and find a successful path forward .
In addition , the Council of Ministers is not yet involved , which means that we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board .
The Maritime Transport Strategy until 2018 has been very much used in preparing the Commission &apos;s Europe 2020 strategy , and the process for a new White Paper on Transport is on its way .
Some of the world &apos;s largest retailers , such as Carrefour and Wal-Mart , have already banned Brazilian beef on the grounds of the deforestation the industry is responsible for .
As a result of the financial and economic crisis , Iceland went from being the fifth richest country in the world to being a country racked by crisis , with the collapse of its banking system , where 40 % of households could not pay their bills and pensioners lost their life &apos;s savings .
This makes sense if the relevant data really do not impose any additional burden , in other words , if the Member States are indeed in a position to collate these data using already existing data sources .
In the past month alone , we have had the scandal of the University of East Anglia ; then we have had the debacle over the Himalayan glaciers and now , we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the Amazon .
Bo≈æ√≠ pokoj s Vami !
So let me first answer Mr Papanikolaou .
The EU must continue to put pressure on Mugabe , and if there is a decision to hold elections , the EU should be involved as an observer .

In accordance with point 15 of the resolution , I believe it is crucial that all free trade agreements contain negotiated social and environmental standards , including : a list of minimum standards that all the EU &apos;s trade partners should observe , as well as a list of additional conventions that should be implemented gradually and flexibly , taking into account the economic situation and the social and environmental issues of a given partner .
( LT ) Madam President , the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is particularly important , both for the safety of the environment and people and for that of society .
The Canadian chief negotiator even admitted at the start of the year that this agreement was a top priority for Canada .
We have gradually realised this in the European Union and energy security has therefore become one of the Union &apos;s strategic priorities .
Perhaps the system does not allow for the necessary economic elasticity and self-determination to enable governments to deal with idiosyncratic problems effectively , such as rates of inflation .
I believe that women &apos;s equal involvement in the management of resources , in economic opportunities , and in government and political life , will have a positive impact on the economic development of our society , thereby strengthening countries &apos; ability to develop , reduce poverty and be run efficiently and better .
No !
It is a great mistake and it is dangerous to confuse peaceful protests and criminal acts such as those committed in Athens .
What we did in the Harbour and Trautmann reports was essentially to choose .
This resolution covers a range of important themes .
So we can end on a happy note , which is very important , especially before the elections .
For the EU to be a credible player in the peace process , it is necessary to demonstrate that it applies the EU &apos;s fundamental values in all contexts and that it complies with the international-law acquis consistently at any point and on any issue .
The creation of a European unitary patent within the European Union will bring with it advantages for all the users involved and , in particular , for small and medium-sized enterprises , insofar as it will contribute to their competitiveness through a reduction in costs .
The opinion of the European Parliament on the matter will be welcomed in view of the European Council in March .
The pretext of this is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market , in the belief that any economic growth resulting from this will foster political stability throughout the region .
This Parliament has been asked to define by codecision the architecture of SIS II which , of itself , would have ensured the security necessary for our area of freedom , security and justice .
After a botched trial , and his incarceration far from his family , which makes visits difficult , Taoufik Ben Brik has been left in a state of health that makes one fear for his life .
This positive trend , however , has not been accompanied by the protection and upholding of passengers &apos; rights : passengers have pointed out many problems , including cancellations , overbooking , loss of luggage and delays .
However , it would seem that the first one we must face is the food shortage , as there are already one billion people on Earth suffering from hunger .
Unfortunately , however , the real aim appears to have been to beat down and attack our small and medium-sized enterprises .
I think the question of geographical balance , which is emphasised so often , could have been resolved in a much better way .
On the other hand , we cannot ignore tendencies in the area of media freedom that cause concern .
I really do not understand how it is possible to make this kind of criticism against the European institutions , by using the death of so many people .
Let us monitor closely the Commission &apos;s commitment to welcoming the important proposals of this report , in the belief that a full appreciation of the central role of the urban dimension in EU politics constitutes an indispensable condition for its success .

( FI ) Madam President , the debate here has been very interesting , and it seems that the European Parliament is very committed to support for the climate conference in Copenhagen .
Regardless of the developments which led to the outbreak of this conflict , it is already having adverse effects of significant proportions on the civilians in the area and on the United Nations &apos; presence in Gaza .
I say this because it is , above all , the poorest , most vulnerable populations that are suffering , and we cannot continue to stand by and watch .
I am expecting the same level of interest from the US authorities as well regarding the equal treatment of Member States in relation to the Visa Waiver programme .
If Mrs Roure wants to go to Lampedusa tomorrow morning , she will not find a single minor , and if she reads the Italian newspapers , she will discover that it was Mr Maroni who exposed trafficking in organs : children used to disappear from Lampedusa when we had a Left government in our country .
I do not deny that nuclear energy can form part of a well-balanced European energy basket and that its use may lessen our external dependence in this field , but I believe the European Union cannot avoid sharing in the effort to close down that obsolete nuclear facility while also ensuring that economic recovery projects deserve adequate funding .
The decisions of the NATO Summit , and also the declarations , for example , of the President of the United States , confirm that NATO is not resisting the common security and defence policy , but is trying , rather , to find a way of cooperation which is beneficial to both institutions .
Mr Schmidt proposed an amendment concerning voluntary participation of non-euro area Member States in the sanctions regime .
Mr Leinen &apos;s report shows how the Treaty will affect the work of Parliament , and the report covers very thoroughly the implications for Parliament of new policy areas , new powers and new procedures .
I do not want to make any accusations , but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around .
Thank you very much .
We do not understand how this issue can be the subject of discussions , hesitations and the calling into question of the Union &apos;s competences within the Council , when the treaty clearly indicates that this is an area in which the EU also has responsibilities .
Minorities , particular the Baha &apos;is , are persecuted .
We are all committed to the protection of nature and public health , but it is also necessary to maintain some sense of balance .
Now , obviously , we must use this to arrive at a Community policy on asylum and a Community policy on immigration .
As the Afghans have to adjust , so too do we , helping them to get an achievable state model combining modernity with the Afghan tradition .
I think this is the perfect time to review the terms of this fundamental debate .
Furthermore , with the stagnant situation in Africa , Europe is more and more intimidated by flows of immigration that might become strenuous to the welfare state .
The introduction of a minimum wage is a decision which should be left to the sole discretion of Member States .
This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement ( FTA ) between the European Union and India .
Additionally , the Council again mentioned the importance of further improvements in access to finance - I am thinking of loans , guarantees , mezzanine finance , etc - and also to venture capital for newly established innovative enterprises and for small and medium-sized enterprises where it is necessary to take account of the effects of the current financial crisis .
The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of the same coin .
Mr Verhofstadt , the liberal alternative , and Mr Juncker , the federalist alternative , were not acceptable .
Finally , the Agadir agreement should be extended in order to improve the development of South-South exchanges .
For that reason I hope that we can improve children &apos;s safety by increasing the amount of material on the Internet that might encourage , educate and develop them , and not the sort of thing we see today , which there is , unfortunately , so much of there , and which can harm the growth of the overall personality of the young .
That would be unfortunate .
MEPs have said &apos; no &apos; to the flexible response and &apos; no &apos; to the inadmissible pressure exerted by France on the primary democratic body of the European continent !
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the international community we are undoubtedly staking much of our credibility on events in Afghanistan .
However , our arguments must have substance so that people do not feel that the European Union is only concerned about itself , but can see that it is concerned about the interests of its citizens .
This explains why we have this still timid call from members encouraging Member States to receive those innocent detainees who cannot return to their own countries for fear of torture .
As is customary with European Union legislation , the Commission was asked , after a certain time , to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions about whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act .
Of course , banning political parties is generally a bad idea , although there are exceptions to that rule .
We cannot deny that over the past decade , tourism has changed radically , thanks , among other things , to technological progress .
If and when Turkey engages unambiguously in establishing good relations with its neighbours , settling outstanding problems peacefully in conformity with the UN Charter and other European documents , then there is hope .
We have learnt the lessons from our past and realise that we have to act immediately to prevent such things from happening in that way again .
She then turned to the black man sitting next to the South African lady and said , &apos; Sir , if you would like to get your things , I have a seat ready for you in first class up at the front . &apos;
Secondly , the one-stop shop idea , which is already in use internally within the EU , could be put to better use in the BRIC countries - that is Brazil , Russia , India and China - to increase the amount of exports and outward investment that European companies can make .
You represent a country where people took a stand against the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops .
Under the directive , fund managers must be registered and authorised and respect stringent codes of conduct within the European Union .
Three years ago , a report was adopted on visa facilitation with Russia , which passed my own amendment saying that the requirement of the mandatory registration procedure is a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU .
The people are simply dreaming of a better life , and a better life does not necessarily mean democracy .
It is evident that the inhabitants of affected areas very often remain cut off in terms of transport links around the country , and the capacity of civil aviation resources is limited .
It points out that these policies must always be implemented against the backcloth of respect for the EU &apos;s Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I said in conclusion that we would host the conference and I would hope that , subject to your availability , of course , that you might consider my invitation to attend part of this meeting , Baroness Ashton .
My support for this report highlights the importance of solidarity within our European societies , particularly in this European Year for Combating Poverty .

I hope the political will to write a new chapter in the rich history of the OSCE can materialise in Astana .
( FR ) Mr President , is Haiti condemned to misfortune ?
The principles of the rule of law must be respected .
What a difference !
Under the Copenhagen political criteria , Turkey is expected to ensure cultural diversity and promote cultural rights of all its citizens , as set out in our Accession Partnership .
Therefore , Europe &apos;s commitment to its citizens has been reconfirmed by Parliament &apos;s determination to find room in the 2011 budget , despite its greatly reduced margins , to give substance to this fund .
It is for this reason that the parliamentary question was backed by such a large majority in the Committee , something I welcome very much .
Finally , I would like to say that the fact that a rapporteur from one of the small groups took on such a complicated dossier with the active cooperation of shadow rapporteurs from other political groups is an important democratic signal and something of which this institution should be proud .
I believe it is essential to support Europe &apos;s SMEs , along with the full liberalisation of the free movement of people , goods and services , so as to maximise the gains of the Single Market .
There are , however , other concerns .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .
The report by Ms Swinburne comes at an important juncture in the process of regulatory reform .
Ladies and gentlemen , some of what is being called for here is quite simply nonsense , and I will therefore be voting against the report .
Now , however , we need to ensure , in Copenhagen , that the positive result of the last year is also carried on up to the Copenhagen level .
As regards disarmament or the anti-missile shield , the EU must make its position clear to Russia and the US .
It goes without saying that cohesion tools , and above all the funds , must represent real European added value for our fellow citizens , but today , in the context of the severe crisis hitting Europe , they must be more responsive and more adapted to urban situations in particular .
Whereas , in regard to the first problem , we have funds for development and cooperation programmes supported by the EU and which are obviously still not sufficient , in the case of the second matter , the problem has to date been dealt with in different ways at Member State level .
A catalogue needs to be made of all the private quality certification systems and a legislative framework of basic principles needs to be adopted at EU level in order to ensure that these systems operate transparently .
We will , however , prepare a final assessment once the final rule on ESTA has been published , and this evaluation will also address the question of the ESTA fee if the fee is really put into place .
Madam President , as we know , many dangerous chemical substances are authorised for general use , in spite of the dangerous ingredients they contain .
- ( FR ) Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I have discovered from your Czech historians the reason why you have not ratified the Treaty of Lisbon : they talk in fact of the magic of the figure 8 , as in 2008 .
The green &apos; New Deal &apos; , in other words a new logic for economic organisation based on innovations in environmental technology and supported by international capital markets , will become the cornerstone of increasing numbers of economic rescue and stimulus programmes , including among the European Union Member States .
The bilateral agreements of some Member States , implementing projects such as &apos; Nord Stream &apos; , causes distrust not just over environmental issues , but also principles of solidarity , and therefore there must be transparency in this area .
I think that that is a good thing , that it is important .
We all understand that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy and this is reflected clearly in the Europe 2020 strategy .
However , what is important now is that the Commission and the Member States drive a hard bargain in Copenhagen .
My second comment relates to the putting into perspective of multilateralism , an idea that has been professed so often in this House .
In Parliament , many colleagues across the political groups have already demonstrated their involvement , but our duty is to put much greater political power into this issue .
I think that our primary task is to complete the entire process , the consolidation of the Single Market , by as transparent means as possible , in close cooperation with the European Parliament .
I think that one way in which I can do that is by using the Dutch proverb : &apos; All monks of the same order should have to wear the same habit &apos; .
That is why I am asking the European Ombudsman to give more encouragement to national ombudsmen to hold regular exchanges of views with their national parliaments , modelled on the exchanges held between the European Ombudsman and ourselves in the European Parliament .
Firstly , there is the creation and preservation of jobs , with the emphasis not so much on social assistance issues , but chiefly on investment in infrastructure and business recovery , so that these jobs may be created .
Madam President , Mrs Figueiredo put it excellently , and I should just like to add one thing .
Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the abolition of the former pillar structure , all conditions for the US visa waiver programme now fall under EU competence .
We therefore welcome the Commission &apos;s initiative and , with the consent of my fellow rapporteur , Mrs Lochbihler , we lend it our full support .
We have a significant problem related to competition between two courts : the one in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice .
This includes the harmonisation of size labelling , social economic labelling and , most worryingly , a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer .
( SV ) Mr President , Europe &apos;s greatest failure today is that we have still not succeeded in putting a stop to the people-trafficking that is going on right in front of our eyes .
So , as you can see , an economic and social reversal in the functioning of Europe , in European culture , is on its way .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , as it was important to put this topic on the table .
Since this is a disease where the medication costs are very high and cannot be met by the majority of patients , increased funding for these drugs is desirable .
I would like once again to express on behalf of everyone here our deepest sympathy and our solidarity with the victims and their families .
If this process is now re-opened , I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested , because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
We must appeal to regional and local authorities , as well as to all other stakeholders , and urge them to take advantage of this second chance .
The EU has to adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effective at early prevention and detection of fraud , so that public funds are only made available when they are actually going to be used correctly , notwithstanding effective punishment for those who break the rules by attempting to illegitimately appropriate such funds , which are scarce by nature .
So , I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s opinion that the whole package has only one tooth , namely reverse QMV .
The challenges were huge : there was the transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to that provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon and also the drafting of the next multiannual programme , which will define the priorities to be given to the area of freedom , security and justice for the next five years .
I believe that we have here a currency that is , in fact , solid , and solid in historical terms , too .
It is core to everything that we will do in the country to make sure that there is indeed the rule of law in operation and that applies in the legal system of course , but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so essential .
It is within this framework that the problems of operational needs and the harmonisation of expenditure by the European Parliament and the European Union need to be addressed .
We know that .
This measure refuses to consider properly evaluating the products before they are placed on the market and makes absolutely no mention of the dangers , denounced time and again , of the marketing of GMOs .
You rightly say that we must prevent the farm from catching fire in the first place and that is the decisive point which I would like to discuss .
The issue of whether drug abusers should face criminal charges is a matter for Member State law and the EU should not be seeking to pervert the course of justice .
They are waiting for that .
Member States now must take appropriate measures which could lead to the prevention of hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths in the poorest households across the continent .
Then we shall stop before the final vote .
No economic and regional integration will come to fruition if the Union does not have the courage to tackle existing conflicts and to do this based on international law .
What we want to see now is for its implementation to take place really quickly and we are calling on the Commission to make money available to support this process .
I agree with the rapporteur when she states that appropriate transposition , implementation and enforcement of the Directives on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices and on misleading and comparative advertising are of fundamental importance to the achievement of the aims laid down in the Directives , particularly in the light of the different application and implementation methods and systems used in the Member States , the complexity of some of the legal concepts contained in the Directives , the quantity and exhaustive nature of national standards governing unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising and also the extensive range of application of the Directive .
The European Union should intervene by adopting legislative measures to secure gender equality and to reduce gender segregation in the labour market .
The fact is that consumers are entitled to certain basic information , for example , &apos; what am I buying ? &apos; , &apos; what is it made of ? &apos; and &apos; where does it come from ? &apos; .
( PL ) Mr President , in the context of today &apos;s discussion , I would like to draw attention to the controversial proposal to amend Article 47 of the Commission Regulation of 2006 .
I would also like to remind you of the World Trade Organisation &apos;s Global Jobs Pact , which offers an appropriate series of strategic options to enable us to emerge from the crisis .
Given the serious consequences of bluetongue for livestock farms , all measures that facilitate good practice in vaccination should be adopted so as to protect farmers from the loss of animals , which can cause damage that often proves fatal for such farms .
Closure of the sitting
Mr President , one of the changes the Prime Minister spoke of this morning is the Citizens &apos; Initiative .
President-in-Office of the Council . - In December 2008 , the Pozna≈Ñ Conference agreed on a work programme for 2009 , which clearly identified steps towards the Copenhagen Climate Conference to be held in December 2009 .
The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 5 February pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
in writing . - ( SK ) The aim of this proposal is to ensure that consumers in all 27 Member States of the EU can rely on a high level of consumer protection , and that companies of all sizes are capable of supplying goods and providing services to consumers in all 27 EU Member States without unnecessary legal obstacles .
We must retain the benefits of this .
I think that we must vote in support of Claude Moraes &apos;s report as it is part of the general package governing the European Union &apos;s asylum and migration system .
Thousands of young people out on the streets demonstrating , demanding their government does something , demanding that their government cuts rates , demanding that their government devalues .
The agricultural support scheme for the EU &apos;s outermost regions provides an important mechanism for continuing agriculture and maintaining the rural landscape .
If we are purchasing a new building and we do not have more than one alternative in the bag , then it is difficult for us to achieve advantageous terms .

I do not advocate any form of market protectionism , but I demand the strict defence of its proper rules : the rules of a market that is healthy and fair .
In other words , those arrested during that period , based on the crisis we are facing , will need to wait until 2016 or 2017 for Turkey to take them back .
The European Commission shares the honourable Member &apos;s belief that the growing number of children with a migrant background presents the education systems of the majority of our Member States with considerable challenges .
When the day comes for Members to make legislative proposals , each lobby will find a Member to serve its own interests .
That is why I voted as I did .
This is where the second part of the European Economic Recovery Programme comes in and logically , this also supports the Lisbon strategy .
in writing . - Today , Parliament voted to block the authorisation of thrombin for use as a food additive .
Whatever happened to solidarity ?
Parliament helped to make the directive more ambitious than the Council &apos;s common position on certain important points .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was established to provide additional support to workers who are suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
According to the legal procedure , the Council will adopt the text after the usual legal and linguistic finalisation , after which the directive can be published in the Official Journal of the European Union within the shortest possible time .
Body scanners are not infallible but they are the best technology available at present and so we need to use what tools we have to hand in order to reduce the terrorist threat .
We are not helping them if we are suggesting that they can escape that route ; that is not helping them .
A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value : respect for cultural and linguistic diversity .
In my home country , Estonia , this fund has not been used , and when I inquired why that was , I was told that the conditions were very stringent and that the limit , which until now was 1 000 people , made it impossible .
I believe that together , we shall succeed in establishing the basic principles that should guide and facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , it is very disturbing to see an increase in the incidence of vicious and violent attacks on Christians and their communities .
Proposals are also being made to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and look in particular detail at what is going on regarding debt , to enhance economic governance in the euro area by the Euro Group , and to establish a robust and credible excessive debt prevention and resolution mechanism for the euro area , which could involve establishing a European Monetary Fund .
A further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing .
We do not want &apos; shopping around &apos; to exist and a new Delaware to be created in the European Union , where companies can circumvent this type of legislation .
Firstly , the EU 2011 budget has set priorities , which need to be strengthened in light of the economic problems throughout Europe following the structural crisis of recent years .

( The President cut off the speaker and called him to order )
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster , with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries .
We need to evaluate and to get a full understanding of what we have , its effects , what is possibly missing and what is overlapping in order to be able to propose new measures and more thought through measures .
I believe that this is a collective responsibility and that it would therefore be healthy if everyone contributed their fair share towards tackling the crisis .
However , we have talked about this comprehensive approach before .
This 13th session is the most important one to take place in 2010 , and it will include high-level meetings and discussions with government ministers on a number of important issues already mentioned by the Commissioner and the Minister , such as , for example , the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation worldwide .
I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many .
( CS ) This necessary proposal for revising the directive on late payments , which we have been discussing today , is decidedly better than the original proposal .
( Applause )

We think that it is necessary and welcome for European financial institutions to be involved in funding arrangements , amending the structure of eligible costs , eliminating ceilings for advance payments or prior notice .
No other industrialised countries have done as much as we have , but these blocs will be forced to do the same as we have if we can conclude this round .
He has our clear support to lead the Commission for another term .
Let me say that the ECB appreciates the recent statements by the US authorities , namely the Secretary of the US Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , reiterating that a strong dollar vis-√†-vis the other major convertible currencies is in the interests of the United States .
Mr President , this House has been treated in an insulting and almost humiliating way throughout this whole process .
All the data could certainly be collected for the government by just one office , and not a very big one at that .
In other words , the first option is that you decide , for ideological reasons , to say that default is out of the question , in which case that would be to deny reality .
We have tasked the Ministers and Commissioners with moving this concrete work forward , notably through the Transatlantic Economic Forum .
It is our common responsibility to ensure that ESAs get down to business as soon as possible .
The ministers of the Weimar initiative have raised this in a letter to you , Mrs Ashton .
The second objective is to confirm that this is not a marginal sector or an exception ; rather it is firmly established in the market economy , with its own rules that the internal market must recognise and respect .
Secondly , the storage of gas reserves is important , but again we need to recognise that it is expensive and funding will be required .

in writing . - This report refers to the proposal for a Council regulation which derogates from the Single CMO Regulation with regard to the intervention periods for butter and skimmed-milk powder .
Funds should be obtained on a regional basis , but authority must be central .
In my view , it should be mandatory for them to be listed on the transparency register .
It would appear that my fellow Member does not know the difference between training and education .
For the first time ever , the European Parliament is being so responsible right from the start of the budget debate .
The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and - let us be honest - you want this data to tax and control , which explains your thirst for ever more statistics .
I have just been down to the press room and I note that eight journalists are actually listening to the vote - others may be watching on the screens , where every single vote is being broadcast .
We continue to hope , and we regularly appeal to the authorities of the People &apos;s Republic of China , to change their attitude to the Tibetan nation and to begin a fruitful dialogue with its representatives .
Mr President , I want to make a personal statement in relation to what Mr Martin just said .
If we do not have this , then the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme will remain a single central programme and it will be important for us to ensure that SWIFT only transfers individual items of data .
The financial intermediaries must pass these loans on to the small businesses .
I stated in my introduction the direction in which the Commission seeks to go , but I will certainly be very happy to take up your suggestions also .
The message I have been trying to get across in my constituency in the West Midlands is that the media , the internet , schools and workplaces all have a vital role to play in making the public aware .
Misunderstandings regularly occur , especially in relation to the purchaser &apos;s right of withdrawal and delivery conditions .
These are the reasons that have led me to vote in favour of the resolution amending Directive 2001 / 83 / EC .
With regard to fishing opportunities , 45 tuna seiners and 25 surface longliners will be authorised to fish .
This must be part of building what is , after all , to be a common policy on nuclear energy .

My group feels that three main elements are needed in that package .
( PT ) Madam President , the events in recent weeks in the Western Sahara were not an isolated incident .
I would also like to thank Mr Swoboda for the good cooperation on the Croatia report .
The vote will take place on Wednesday , 19 January 2011 .
As a result of a worldwide price collapse , European milk producers suffered huge losses .
I will not go into it further , but for Mr Eppink to stand there waving a photograph knowing full well that I was there in my official capacity and that that was not my personal conviction , well , I have to say that I feel very let down by him .
The Greek authorities are invited by the Commission in our proposal to the Council to present by mid-March a detailed implementation report announcing adopted measures and the calendar of the announced measures .
Here , again , I would like Europe to be the first to move at global level .
Our duty in the European Parliament and on the Subcommittee on Human Rights is to remind the Council and the Commission that the results of human rights dialogues also play a very prominent role at the summits themselves .
I look forward to your answers .
This relates not only to the working conditions , which are being called into question , but in many Member States , the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive .
In our own analysis , the taxpayer risk that has been mobilised to help avoid a dramatic depression is approximately the same on both sides of the Atlantic in terms of GDP , approximately 27 % of GDP .
( FR ) Madam President , this draft directive is of key importance in the fight against illegal immigration and has been essential to the introduction of a common policy on immigration .
I look forward to more intensified exchanges on this with the European Parliament as we move into what is hopefully the final phase .
Before the end of my mandate I would like to thank all my fellow Members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance who have supported me with my report .
I do not wish to evade giving an answer , nor do I simply want to say that I will not answer , but you are well aware that if you ask a question in Parliament , it is possible that I will not wish to use my position as President-in-Office of the Council for a question that is internal to a Member State of the Union .
Texts of agreements forwarded by the Council : see Minutes
This is the only way that a healthy democracy can be created where everyone &apos;s rights are respected .
It is therefore necessary to repeal the current directive and make provision for an improved system of assistance for recovery within the internal market that will guarantee fast , effective and uniform procedures throughout the European Union .
Very briefly , I have two questions for President Buzek , which I trust you will pass on to him .
( The sitting was suspended at 20.10 and resumed at 21.00 . )
We have been working to improve legal cooperation with regard to detecting , investigating and prosecuting cross-border criminals and terrorists .
I would like to stress that , since the causes of the accident have not yet been clarified , it is inappropriate to draw conclusions .
We are saying that we are facing a wall of silence .
in writing . - The mid-term review of the Financial Framework 2007-2013 is not practical or realistic because of the lack of certainty linked to : the ratification process of the Treaty of Lisbon ; the end of the current parliamentary term ; the outcome of the European elections ; and the setting-up of the new Commission in the current economic context .
As the debate made clear , there is a tall order for this semester .
In the Spanish Presidency &apos;s statement at the plenary session in January 2010 , the Presidency highlighted its firm intention to combat violence against women , to propose draft legislation to fight violence against women , and to establish a European Observatory of Domestic Violence .
If my group were to agree to this , we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do .
Mr Hans-Peter Martin has asked for the floor due to personal allusions .
At the same time , the Commission will have to present an assessment of the results from this harmonisation process in good time , in order to ensure that this has not caused any distortion of the market .
We therefore appeal to the World Bank to adopt a development approach that can maximise benefits to the poor while , at the same time , allowing us to combat climate change .
The only problem is that short-term , institutionalised support schemes never remain short-term , despite the many fine declarations of intent .
The European Union , together with other international institutions such as NATO and , if possible , the United Nations Security Council , must make it clear to totalitarian regimes such as those of North Korea and Iran that further development of nuclear weapons cannot be tolerated .
Where critical journalists are murdered , the truth also dies .
This crisis has been brought about , as we all know , by a kind of casino capitalism , crony capitalism , and a financial services sector that has been subject to no regulation - or to light-touch regulation , as it is sometimes politely referred to .
The Maputo Agreement foresees the establishment of a national unity government with a transition period of 15 months .
There is also a need for confidence in our shared commitment to preserve our particular brand of social market economy , and in our long-term agenda for a low-carbon economy .
in writing . - The Arctic has long been absent from our agenda , but now it is once again drawing the attention of politicians and academics .
The vote will take place on Tuesday , 14 December .
I am confident this framework will evolve with time , but I very much welcome Mr H√∂kmark &apos;s report because it strengthens the proposal while keeping the balance we need .
As the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , we endorse cooperation in the area of legal immigration as long as we make it clear that we are simultaneously sharpening our attack against illegal immigration .
Because of this , Parliament and the Union should also consider expressing their solidarity , formally if possible , with our country and all the countries involved in this attack .
( ES ) Madam President , we are talking about more than 360 actions in five years .
On the one hand , this resolution rightly states that it is a shame that the best and most talented people are leaving developing countries , and that this brain drain is harmful to their economy .
It is a long and difficult road and the objective will not be achieved overnight .
Lithuania needs these young people &apos;s talents , experience and diligence to overcome the demographic challenges mentioned .
The European Parliament , through this report , has asked for a number of investigations into the different trading venues that are currently regulated under MiFID and seeks a closer analysis to ensure that venues providing equivalent services are regulated to an equivalent level .
At the present time , attention is mainly paid to implementation of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012 , which is aimed at strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the unacceptable consequences of drug addiction .
On 4 February , a good number of Member States and many Members of the European Parliament with whom I spoke at the time were worried about where we were heading and what would become of the European Union if we outsourced important matters .
We are seeking early consultation between the two parties when political incidents occur that may affect the other party .
It would be better , however , if they complained about themselves , if they complained about the European leaders .
I am therefore convinced of the importance of this agreement and confirm my vote in favour of the agreement reached .
Thirdly , having an internal market is a crucial factor in terms of the security of supply .
That is why we are in full agreement with the rapporteur when , in paragraph 40 of her report , she calls on Turkey &apos; to facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations by withdrawing Turkish forces and allowing the two leaders to negotiate freely their country &apos;s future &apos; .
In some Member States , patients lack easy access to even the most basic information about the pharmaceuticals they are prescribed .
Mr President , as Mr Papanikolaou said , the objective of the Culture Programme is to enrich the cultural experience of European citizens by promoting our common cultural heritage .
It is worth noting , though , that in the impact assessment that the Commission has put before us , we are talking about a sum of around 0.1 % of the total fare for these measures .
The debate is closed .
At the same time , fishermen are dependent on the vagaries of the weather and unfair competition .
I think that it shows clearly that there are limits to integration in this field - but not only in this field .
It is , for example , clear to us that we must continue to support these regions , which currently fail to achieve even 75 % of the average gross domestic product of the European Union .
In the case of the mining sector , accidents can often have a cross-border impact .
It is true that we are in the middle of a crisis , and the Court , which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries , absorbs large sums of money .
Bizarrely , it is almost impossible to achieve the involvement of the parliaments of partner countries in those agreements .
Another important factor as far as we are concerned is the passengers .
However , the protection also has to involve the children themselves .
Hopes are high regarding the very important and sensitive matter of the common agricultural policy .
The rapporteur , Mr S√∏ndergaard , will be with us later due to a flight delay , so I will call on him to speak later .
The Mediterranean diet still consists of high-fibre bread , large amounts of fruit and vegetables - which is why we welcome the Commission &apos;s School Fruit Scheme - fish , dairy products in moderation , and wine too .
There is thus a general desire in Parliament to re-examine certain key points of this directive and unfortunately , there has been no meeting between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur in recent days to discuss the 60 amendments .
I therefore just want to express my surprise and request that for the next time , we all know what we have to do to be able to speak .
One other reason why I voted for strengthening the OSCE is the human rights aspect , involving respect for minorities &apos; rights and fundamental freedoms , which are key elements in the OSCE &apos;s integrated security concept .
in writing . - I supported this report which puts forward proposals to tackle violence against women across Europe and calls for all Member States to prioritise this issue .
My group , the ECR Group , calls for a genuinely democratic and peaceful transition in Egypt .
While I recognise that it is partly up to Member States to inform the Commission of any changes in their economic status , the approach of the Commission should not remain the same regardless .
We therefore call for the explicit recognition of regional governments in the context of the Copenhagen agreement , recognising the key role they are playing in mitigation and adaptation policies .
So , thanks to you all , from whatever parties , who have really been working for culture to become important and culture to be able to speak to the people .
In countries afflicted by the scourge of civil war , a permanent state of conflict or massacres , the consequences of this situation are catastrophic from a humanitarian and development perspective .
It is our duty to ensure that no one will have to choose to give up children for work or work for children .
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on this report , I am delighted that it has been adopted today by the plenary of the European Parliament .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s support for extending the transitional period so that , when we do have the new legislation , all countries will have the same legislation .
The EU is not democratic and is therefore not a suitable guardian of people &apos;s rights .
I would also like to emphasise a fundamental characteristic of the fund , which is to help people rather than companies and , from this perspective , we cannot therefore see it as a life support machine for companies that have no realistic hope of functioning in economic terms , but rather the contrary .
Decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
( DE ) Madam President , as a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain and of Central European integration , the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor is , as we know , currently regaining the importance that it had before the collapse of the Danube Monarchy .
This directive and the corresponding changes set out technical rules on the design and manufacture of agricultural and forestry tractors , and on their respective approval system , which requires EU-level harmonisation with a view to creating the conditions necessary for road safety .
We will have a very important crisis management tool in our hands .
Moreover , there are a number of other Member States in which the majority of voters would certainly have voted against the Treaty of Lisbon had they been given the chance .
People of a different religion should not be discriminated against .
I agree with the rapporteur that we really need better coordination of research projects and cofinancing within the Union .
Political pluralism is an integral part of any democracy .
the report by Mr Hoang Ngoc , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the long-term sustainability of public finances for a recovering economy &#91; COM ( 2009 / 0545 - 2010 / 2038 ( INI ) ) &#93; , and
in writing . - Resettlement of refugees is a process in which it is possible for these individuals to be resettled following a request by the UNHCR where it is deemed that there is a need for such individuals to receive international protection .
This is why the Commission put forward a Communication on Alzheimer &apos;s and other dementias in 2009 with action to improve prevention and diagnosis , research and best practice exchange .
It is likewise to no one &apos;s benefit for various countries around the world to clear rainforests - 12 500 km2 of rainforest was cleared in Brazil last year .
in writing . - ( SK ) As a rapporteur for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I became involved in drafting the package of legislation on placing goods onto the market which was approved by Parliament in February 2008 .
It seems that the EU acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis , and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages .
However , I understand what you are saying and I thank you for your understanding .
In the first case , in January , Mr Dalli told us , when speaking about dioxins , that you would take all the necessary measures to ensure that legislation on the food control system was tightened up .
Although all the other Member States have negotiated bilateral agreements with Brazil so as to ensure a short-stay visa waiver , at present , however , it is no longer possible for the Member States to conclude this type of agreement on an individual basis .
Drawing on many years of experience in the media sector , I proposed some amendments to this report , which aims to put public and private media on an equal footing in order to enable them to provide better quality information of importance to the public .
After months of uncertainty , a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which , for some , is grounds for hope , while for others , grounds for concern .
In Poland , the country which I represent , about 250 000 people suffer from Alzheimer &apos;s , and specialists estimate that by 2040 , this figure will have trebled .
Given that we have 27 countries with 27 different health care systems , the Commission &apos;s proposal , based solely on Article 95 - the famous harmonisation article - will lead to the dismantling of the national healthcare systems and thus remove the responsibilities from the Member States .
It is our belief that this will be extremely unworkable , costly and inefficient , particularly in schools which have children from many diverse linguistic backgrounds and would do little to foster integration of migrants into local communities .
I would also like to highlight the recognition given to traditional agriculture , particularly organic and small-scale farming , which exists in the more disadvantaged regions , and which represents not only an economic asset but , above all , an environmental asset , as it is essential for preserving biodiversity .
Unless the specification and allocation of emission allowances is proportional , it will be impossible to avoid distortion of competition .
Fortunately , this battle is taking place not with weapons , but mainly in the economic sector .
I am making this point above all because I see a similarity between what is happening at the moment in the Middle East , in North Africa , and what happened in Europe in 1989 .
The European Union presence in Kosovo is progressively materialising , taking over from the United Nations .
The motion for a resolution contains aspects , in more detail , with which we cannot agree , particularly the promotion of &apos; world-wide carbon emission trading &apos; , given that this solution has already shown not to offer advantages in reducing carbon emissions , as well as the creation of more public-private partnerships , emphasising a &apos; substantive increase in the portion of public investment &apos; , thus using public money to serve private interests and profit .
Yet the practicalities of an agreement with a state the size of Congo create all sorts of daunting problems .
As far as I am concerned , I believe that there is only one race - the human race .
President Mubarak , as he is today - and I respect his long struggle - is incapable of leading the political transition ; it is madness to ask that of him and to let the Mubarak clan square up to the ElBaradei clan today on the streets of Cairo .
The social situation has evolved very favourably , with a spectacular increase in the average per capita income , and now the vast majority of Tunisians meet the criteria defining membership of the middle class .
I would like to make a few comments about the reports themselves .
In short , we are in the midst of a general crisis in our society &apos;s model of development yet we are still clinging to an idea of the market that appropriates nature itself for private gain .
The report therefore has my backing .
Cabotage should be liberalised , but it is still too soon to do so suddenly and indiscriminately .
Mr President , this Parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the Member States themselves .
I do not believe in continually making new demands , and therefore Mr Oettinger is absolutely right .
You know what I am referring to : the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland .
Consequently , the instruments that are available to the consumer organisations should be improved to make it easier for them to act effectively at EU level and at national level .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
The opt-out that you want still exists in practice , as opposition to progress has carried it through .
Serbia has been making good progress on its unilateral implementation of the interim agreement , and we will obviously look very carefully at the upcoming report by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor concerning its cooperation with its efforts .
In the EU alone 5.4 million tonnes of bananas were sold in 2008 .
However , I wish to point out that members of the Commission are not there to represent countries .
Extra restrictions are now being imposed on the admission of products , and rightly so , but this will not harm agriculture to a disproportionate extent .
Secondly , it was the European Parliament which presented its proposals for priorities first , and not the Commission .
in writing . - ( NL ) The former employees and the four suppliers of Opel Antwerp are still angry at the way they were treated by GM .
Personally I am convinced that the decision taken by the European Union last October to suspend the sanctions was the right one , and , in fact , this suspension has given rise to a positive process .
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation , food production must increase by at least 70 % if it is to meet the growing needs of the world &apos;s population .
Voting time
( DE ) Mr President , the old saying &apos; I love treason but I hate a traitor &apos; is something that is proven true over and over again .
It is surely possible to help poor regions of the EU while , at the same time , using good projects to tackle climate change , reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy and modern technological solutions .
All these elements form a whole that enables us , in my view at least , to come up with a coherent response .
I would also like to suggest strongly that the Union should also decide to align itself with these various useful additional protocols that relate to such issues as opposition to torture or the fight against racism , as well as more effective laws .
There you have it .
It is the job of the Member States , with the support of the European Commission , to protect and develop our forests for future generations so that they can continue making a contribution in future to our natural habitats , our society and our economy .
This is not acceptable .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Chastel , landmines will probably continue to be a major problem even far into the future .
Most attention should be paid to increasing youth unemployment , one of society &apos;s most acute problems .
The final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday , 20 January 2011 , pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure , has been distributed .
However , this form was rejected as &apos; incomplete &apos; by the Commission and I can confirm that , almost five months later , the Irish Government has still not submitted a complete application .
Moreover , the Basque Eurocity of Bayonne-San Sebasti√°n already has an underused international airport , which is far away from any vulnerable nature areas .
Furthermore , the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to a new economic and social climate at local and regional level , which will take into account the increase in energy costs .
I am grateful that I was permitted to take on responsibility and that as a citizen I am , of course , still responsible for Brandenburg , which is my home , for a united Germany , the fatherland that I love , and for Europe , whose unity will determine our fate and our future .
The ECR Group welcomes this debate .
The examples which our colleagues have given speak for themselves and we can see that Turkey still has a very , very long road ahead of it before it reaches EU standards .
Despite the rapporteur having recognised this fact , the amendments introduced strengthen the role of Eurojust in areas that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the Member States .
The badger-spread disease was first discovered on the day he was due to leave on a two-week holiday last June , and he has since lost 64 of his 82-strong herd .
Above all , the European Union is strengthening its energy security and is banking on the development of businesses , and particularly of micro-enterprises .
One of the international trade actors which have enacted additional and counterproductive trade barriers is Russia .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr Florenz on a job well done ; this report is a tribute to his consistent presence , attention and contribution .
Once we are confident that the contamination has been stopped , we will concentrate on what happened in the information sector , with regard to investigation protocols and in terms of coordination across the board when the crisis occurred , and we will then reflect on whether we need more tools and closer European coordination .
The world is changing , and it simply needs to accept this fact .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s positions and resolutions : see Minutes
For example , in Central Africa , Cameroon has been criticised , not to say strongly condemned , by its neighbours , for having signed this interim agreement with the European Union .
Prime Minister Orb√°n , you are proud of the Hungarian people and you are right to be so , but democracy tells us one thing , from Tocqueville to all theorists of democracy : &apos; truth is not always on the side of the majority &apos; .
This is very important .
Signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
I should like to refer to the situation in France , the situation in Italy - which seems to be even more serious - and the situation in my own country .
Mr President , Mr Barroso did not reply to my charge of interference by the Commission in the democratic process in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty ...
The Commission , in cooperation with the EURES network , is focusing on how best to help those affected with the specific problem of children left at home by parents who are mobile workers and providing job-seekers and their families with information on living and employment conditions in EU countries .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , at the beginning of the month we were told that all remedial measures against the financial crisis have been taken .
I really do wonder what point there would be in having comprehensive , integrated legislation on chemicals if we were then to go and introduce new and deviating regulations for individual products .
Let me thank all those who worked so hard to make this agreement possible , especially the rapporteur of the lead committee , Ms Matias , as well as the rapporteurs of the committees giving opinions , Ms Sartori and Ms Bastos .
It is a big day for us , because we can complete this important dossier at the end of this period .
Eight years after the adoption of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment , the European Parliament is once again giving its opinion on the important issue of recycling high-tech equipment waste .
If there are differing points of view with regard to intervention by the International Monetary Fund , and should such discussions continue , then interest rates will also automatically increase .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are finishing off a job we started 10 years ago ; I still remember clearly the indignation aroused by the accident involving the Erika in December 1999 : the speed with which Commissioner de Palacio presented proposals at that time , the cooperation of the Council - which , under pressure from public opinion , was at least partly responsible for ensuring that the first two packages were ready by June 2002 along with , among other things , my report on monitoring and a European policy for the monitoring of ships and for ports of refuge .
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to it .
Mr President , firstly , please accept the apologies of Mr ≈†efƒçoviƒç and Mr Oettinger , who are otherwise engaged and who have asked me to represent them .
As Parliament &apos;s resolution underlines , unless something is done quickly to reverse it , the loss of biodiversity will be significant and uncontrollable in the medium and long term .
I give the floor to Catherine Ashton to sum up the debate and answer many of those questions .
in writing . - ( NL ) This legislation allows fingerprints to be stored in passports / travel documents so as to allow the authenticity of the document and the holder &apos;s identity to be verified .
This is not what an energy revolution looks like .
To ensure that this objective is achieved , every single person needs to be actively involved and properly informed about how to protect the environment and assume their responsibility towards future generations .
Mr President , you have seen the situation for yourself , but it continues , and it is a case of collective punishment applied by Israel against innocent people there .
I am not overlooking the fact that there is ERTMS for the railways , SESAR , and GALILEO , but in my view we are lacking a user-oriented approach with regard to user information ; to accessibility for persons with reduced mobility and the possibility today of adapting urban vehicles ; to the introduction of an energy-saving urban vehicle ; to safety in the field of transport , especially in relation to public transport , which is a very important issue ; to user information ; and to ticketing , areas in which there is often considerable progress to be made .
This is a reality of which we can be certain .
But this is a political House , and we all do serious politics as best we can .
Mr President , for the welfare of these horses , all the efforts we have made here in this Parliament for the rights of transported animals must not continue to be ignored .
Our ancestors have demonstrated innumerable times that our nations are able to unite if our destiny is at stake .
The cost of regulation falls on the consumer and , in this case , the old-age pensioner .
It is essential that this is done transparently , that Parliament plays an appropriate role and that budgetary rights and budgetary control remain with the budgetary authority .
( CS ) Mr President , I distance myself from the amendments just announced to the Z√°borsk√° report on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity .
This involves , in particular , the question of the legislators .
Instead of saying one year after the earthquake , we should actually be saying one year of earthquakes , because there was the seismic earthquake , then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution , then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak , then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time , and now the earthquake that is , in some respects , historical too , with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist .
This means that if the same guidelines , policies and pressures continue to be applied to Portugal and other countries with weaker economies , divergences will worsen and we will be in an increasingly serious situation because of the European Union &apos;s lack of solidarity .
The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy - including an external dimension - and also integrated maritime surveillance across the sectors and borders to generate maritime situational awareness of activities at sea , impacting , among other things , on maritime safety and security , but also on general law enforcement .
Romania supports the substantial progress made in the negotiations with Turkey , a process which is dynamic enough to encourage internal reforms .
The three months of constant debates , with more than 2 000 experts and NGOs , resulted in the Zaragoza Charter , which precisely reflects the state of the debate between Mexico 2006 and Istanbul .
Hungary ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia on 16 November 2010 .
I am sure every Member would want to ensure that the EU adds value to Member State spending , as well as to individuals and communities .
At the start of this year , a 13-year-old Romanian girl in Italy committed suicide , leaving behind a shocking statement about the discrimination she was subjected to by schoolmates .
We need to overcome the differences that exist between regulators and make sure that we speak with one voice .
I am in favour of Mrs Matias &apos;s report , in that there is a need in Europe to ensure close cooperation and coordination between Member States able to provide an effective response in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease , which today affects 6 million Europeans .
Similarly , when we promote clean technologies , the multinationals appropriate ancestral technologies so as to resell them at a high price to the same populations that invented them .
I call on the regional councils and the prefectures in the French overseas departments , as Structural Fund management authorities , to anticipate these changes so that their regional programmes can be focused immediately on projects showing the best potential for growth and jobs .
The second problem which remains unresolved and which has serious consequences for the new Member States is the calculation of on-call time .
The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland , which are not bound by this agreement , and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands , for which this agreement only relates to those countries &apos; European territories .
This proposal sets out general rules for EU-Greenland trade in , inter alia , fishery products , live bivalve molluscs , echinoderms , tunicates , marine gastropods and their by-products .
However , when we now hear these supporters say that the majority has given its opinion in a democratic way and the minority will simply have to accept that , they are indeed right , but I would have expected to hear that statement after the first referendum in Ireland , too .
We have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world .
We must put in place the objective that we have outlined in the Lisbon Treaty : a social market economy which will bring jobs , which will bring prosperity , and which will bring a decent standard of living to all of our peoples .
As a representative of an ultra-liberal party , his view is not surprising , but it reflects the more general problem that government leaders with certain ideological backgrounds are not prepared to take courageous steps that demand vision , and to implement measures that could conflict with their ideological beliefs .
We would like to bring to a definitive end the times when the concept of stability was used as a bargaining chip , when the concept of stability was used to gain concessions in the areas of human rights and the principles of democracy .
Mr President , Mr Parish rightly reminded us of something to which we have referred many times in this chamber , namely the fact that the way in which we treat animals reflects on us - on how &apos; cultured &apos; and civilised we are .
In my view , the Doha Round is fundamentally important for international trade and may greatly help to reduce poverty in developing countries and to share out the benefits of globalisation more fairly .
Unfortunately , it is precisely these that are frequently counterfeited and often contain no active substance apart from sugar and the tablet compound .
Greece will , of course , go on benefiting from cohesion funds as it is one of the countries benefiting from those cohesion funds , and this is separate from the European Union 2020 Strategy .
√Ågnes Hankiss was accused by a private plaintiff of allegedly committing the crime of public defamation and , in particular , the crime of defaming the memory of a dead person , the plaintiff &apos;s father .
Also among us is Ambassador Christoffersen , who also took part in the negotiations .
The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems completely balanced to me , and I welcome the work carried out by Mr Tarabella to achieve this outcome .
The future of this complex undertaking is by no means clear .
Madam President , on Monday evening , the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka , pursuant to Rule 91 .
This also applies to the foreign service of the Union .
The creation of a European patent will stimulate innovation and scientific and technological development in the EU .
I would like to ask the Commission , the Commissioner and the European Parliament to examine thoroughly and condemn every practice in the territory of the EU that can be used for ethnic or racial discrimination .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the essential question is , of course , what to do now .
It is the role of the European Parliament to speak on this matter .
in writing . - In 2008 , when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament , I tabled a draft amendment to the Criminal Law of the Latvian Republic , toughening responsibility for domestic violence to women and children .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
I am satisfied that the exemptions will not be used in practice since there are safe alternatives that not only consumers , but also professional users , will prefer to choose in the future .
Secondly , the use of building materials which are harmful to health , such as asbestos , must be avoided at all costs .
In other words , this debate is born from the need for precautions , and especially for conclusions , which we have all drawn from examining the success in Detroit that I just mentioned .
Finally , I should like to place particular emphasis on the development of sea corridors and on the proposal submitted by Greece last summer about setting up a transport observatory in the eastern Mediterranean based in Greece .
The European Union can perhaps learn a lesson from the EUR 2 billion that the China-African Development Fund invests in Africa .
The interpretation of the Articles in the Treaty seems to depend on which way the wind is blowing .
I support this report which will also allow Romania to access funds for facilitating the social inclusion of marginalised people , including Roma , in both urban and rural areas .
I would stress that we are talking about international waters here and that Lene Espersen , the Danish Foreign Minister , has also emphatically said that this is unacceptable .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
I had hoped that during this session Parliament would approve the appointment of Jos√© Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for a new five-year period .
the statements by the Council and the Commission on a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balance of payments .
However , at the same time the country was left without healthcare specialists , the majority of whom were Bulgarians .
The interests of big money , whether economic or financial , and the major powers always supersede the interests of solidarity .
The Czech Government , including its President , has every right to say and do what it likes , but it cannot forget that it belongs to the European Union and now speaks on behalf of nearly 500 million citizens and 27 Member States .
This leads to financial problems , a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness , particularly for SMEs .
To close , we consider that the instrument for pre-accession assistance is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries .
Meanwhile , we should introduce sanctions such as freezing assets and a travel ban .
We are familiar with these practices and our proposals are specifically intended to prevent this surreptitious advertising which is found in a number of areas .
Again this year , we are seeing Russia threatening to disrupt gas supplies and there are indications that we will need to prepare for this possibility every winter in future .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for being prepared to make some compromises at the last minute .
Mr President , I welcome the decision of President Barack Obama to attend the EU-US summit this month in Lisbon and I voted in favour of the resolution today .
The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people , systematic torture in prisons , religious and political repression , executions - all these methods are incompatible with the People &apos;s Republic of China &apos;s obligations as a member of the United Nations .
It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent .
There is no sense whatever in that .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the current difficult economic and financial scenario , Europe must continue to support projects in the sector of energy efficiency and renewable energy for a sustainable and social competitive economy .
I found that the debate about the single market and the Services Directive , and how all this ties in with patients &apos; rights , was very interesting .
When it comes to the Tobin Tax and the financial transaction tax , you are right : it is probably something which is not exactly the way that Mr Tobin figured it initially .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that I am delighted to learn that Turkey is so close to the hearts and minds of my fellow member Madlener &apos;s party , the Dutch Party for Freedom .
As stated in the last Council conclusions , human rights should always be addressed on these high-level visits and , when appropriate , meetings with the peaceful pro-democracy opposition will be part of these visits .
However , the only thing which Kozloduy was an example of is how old reactors can be safe and operate perfectly well .
Regarding the Danish Government &apos;s plan regarding controls on the Danish internal borders , which Ms Koppa referred to , you will , of course , be aware that the President of the Commission wrote to the Danish Prime Minister immediately , pointing out that the first analysis by the Commission raised major doubts about whether the proposed measures would be in line with Denmark &apos;s obligations under European and international law .
The European Commission , as the guardian of the EU Treaty , must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and timely submit all necessary information on the expected developments in energy infrastructure .
It is a very clear signal on the part of the European institutions that the citizens of Europe do not agree to the brutal treatment and killing of animals .
Mr Morel is doing a good job as the Special Representative , but this is not enough .
When I look back at the hearing involving the members of the Court of Auditors , I recall that they promised to work closely together with Parliament .
For many private firms , and indeed government transport schemes , additional cost will only result in two things : higher ticket prices for customers and reduced routes .
However , I see light and shadow in the reports .
Written Statements ( Rule 142 )
This is not what we want .
I invite the rapporteur to table an oral amendment to recognise the usefulness and effectiveness of actors who base their work on the Christian faith .
( The sitting was closed at 23 : 00 )
It is not possible , for example , to consider that the settlement of migrant women ought to be supported , especially when it is not actually specified whether they are legal or illegal immigrants .
We agree on the objectives , just as we agreed on the Lisbon Strategy .
I believe that , in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question should be asked of whether the indigenous Arctic people living in the Russian Federation get enough involvement in the work of the Arctic Council .
In that judgment , the Court made a number of comments on ways to improve the listing procedures applied by the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee .
For this I wish to thank all my fellow Members who played a part , the shadow rapporteurs , the rapporteurs and everyone else .
In a context where the economic situation of some countries like Greece is weakening the euro , the will and determination shown by Mr Draghi for steering a steady course for a strong currency are indispensable for ensuring the credibility of our economy .
Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation has no place in European society .
The first is that we need to reach a legally binding agreement .
We have , to some extent , had a foretaste of this with the adoption of the regulation of hedge funds in the Economic and Financial Affairs ( Ecofin ) Council yesterday .
Welcome
I voted in favour of the report because money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund goes to workers affected by collective redundancies .
Part of this policy must be the EU &apos;s ability to react to any possible sudden supply crisis .
The objective of this assistance is to improve the living conditions of beneficiary populations by recommending and providing all those instruments that will ensure that these countries embark on a path towards growth and accountability .
Therefore , the resolution is to do far better in the future , the next opportunity being Mexico this year .
That is a fact .
The blasphemy laws , which carry the death penalty , are incompatible with the common values we seek to promote in our relations with Pakistan .
I endorsed the European Parliament resolution calling , in particular , on the Member States to take steps to help slow down the disease &apos;s progression in sufferers - such as promoting healthy lifestyles and ensuring that medication is available to all sufferers - to establish specialist centres , to provide satisfactory medical equipment nationwide , and to draw up strategic action plans for research in this area .
There is no stability without solidarity .
Since January , 23 000 immigrants have entered Italy .
Thanks to the Maltese Order , the Jesuit Refugee Service and many Christian organisations , governments are acknowledging their obligation to tackle the fate of the refugees .
The Stockholm Summit next week will therefore focus on areas - as has been said already - where there is mutual interest , for example , climate change and energy , and the global economic crisis .
Vice-President of the Commission . - In a world that is moving fast into a new digital age , Europe needs to be prepared with the state of the art broadband infrastructure that will indeed drive the growth of tomorrow .
Madam President , we have voted today on the review of the Green Paper on the future of the TEN-T policy .
As a member of the STOA panel , a project aimed at more efficient management of natural resources , I consider it very important to compile a reliable statistical database .
Last but not least , I would like to touch on the relationship between international trade and climate change .
in writing . - This report proposes various measures , some of which might be of assistance to small businesses , but whose overall effect is to promote EU control , churning of the population , feminist agendas and infiltration of businesses by EU officials &apos; on work-experience &apos; .
This exemption is proposed to tackle a crisis that is plain for all to see and which we have discussed many times .
The tight link between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is very clear .
During those 15 years , the 189 countries which signed the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality have managed to make a certain amount of progress in all 12 areas of concern identified in the document .
Enlargement strategy 2009 concerning the countries of the western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey ( debate )
All actors should avail themselves bona fide of the opportunities presented by the Geneva negotiations .
I understand that the figure that has been put on the amount of illicit trade coming into the European Union by way of cigarettes is EUR 9.5 billion , and 97 % of it goes undetected .
I also welcome the reference to the project bond initiative , which I believe is a useful tool for growth and development in a sector as strategic as that of infrastructure .
The requirements have been met by Bulgaria and Romania and I congratulate Mr Coelho on having combined freedom of movement with the security of citizens in his balanced report , which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We are deciding what should be done in this area , but let us remember that , in terms of financial aid , the fight with the crisis comes first .
However , do you really believe that this is what small businesses and their employees think that the European Union is doing ?
They came to Brussels to tell this Parliament that , if we pass the legislation , as drafted , on alternative investments , then we would cut their organisation &apos;s funding by two thirds .
The keywords will no doubt be &apos; added value &apos; , &apos; consistency &apos; , &apos; flexibility &apos; and &apos; straightforwardness &apos; .
There are of course other means of addressing the crisis than this , but I am sure that Commissioner Almunia is willing to discuss this with you further on a later occasion .
I am in favour of the report because forests , which cover more than 42 % of the EU &apos;s surface area , provide a livelihood for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector .
He knows perfectly well that , unfortunately , it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the seats of the institutions and , unfortunately , under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party , John Major , at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992 , they imposed a legal obligation on the European Parliament to have 12 part-sessions a year in Strasbourg .
The committee considered that benfluorex should not be included in the scope of an ongoing evaluation procedure at European level , concerning certain anorectic agents due to a different mode of action .
We have always maintained that there should be a reconciliation dialogue and that the dialogue should go on .
It makes sense first to have an agreement on the broad outlines of the European Union 2020 strategy , with the budget review then being presented by the new Commission so that the new College will have full ownership of that proposal in order to work with you very closely on the future financial perspectives .
Given the lack of a European policy supporting the shipping sector , it is unlikely that production levels will return to those prior to the current crisis .
There is no sense in continuing to insist on developing the Lisbon Strategy when the economic and social crisis which the application of this Strategy has helped to create is getting worse .
If we allow the status quo to remain , there will be no rail freight left in twenty years &apos; time .
In addition , I should not neglect to point out the great powers of negotiation that this proposal required , particularly on the part of the rapporteur , Mr Rangel .
As the volcanic ash can cause aircraft engines to cut out and can also obscure visibility through aircraft windows , the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation , Eurocontrol , took a responsible approach and made passenger safety its top priority .
It is a legislative package , then , that reconciles health and the environment with competitiveness and innovation , instead of pitting them against one another , as is all too often the case .
I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers .
The outcome of this analysis is expected to be reflected in the follow-up Decent Work Report to be published in 2011 .
I recognise that it is not perfect and that there are concerns .
Besides poverty , which unfortunately is still with us , we are also concerned with global environmental problems like climate change , and now we are essentially talking about a sort of global insurance premium to compensate victims for the social and economic pain caused by financial catastrophe .
Finally , I would like to wish Commissioner Kov√°cs every success in his future endeavours .
However , we do not support the passages concerning an increase in agricultural aid through POSEI for EU producers affected by the agreement .
With these functions available , I believe that European diplomacy should be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the EU &apos;s basic interests , which also concerns energy security .
I would like to emphasise once again that the citizens of the EU are watching with interest to see how we respond to the highly acclaimed Treaty of Lisbon .
We in the June List do not believe that a multiannual programme or a European Agency on linguistic diversity and language learning at EU level will make any difference to Europe &apos;s approximately 500 million inhabitants , except to burden taxpayers even further .
However , this legitimate matter has become , in some sense , an element - let us say it sincerely - of a certain interinstitutional war which has been going on between the European Parliament and the Council for years .
You should accept that one of the reasons that the Commission puts forward so many ill-considered , ill-thought out , inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals , which we in England and other countries have to put up with , is the lack of transparency .
Understand that one if you can !
However , it will be of little consolation to those affected - the mourning families and the seriously injured - if we continue to emphasise that the railway is the safest form of transport and that the number of accidents is very low compared with those on the roads .
However , we are also calling for the problem of the visa requirement that has been partially reintroduced by the Canadian Government for EU citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania to be resolved during the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit .
The European Parliament also has a vital role to play .
It goes without saying that the new strict framework would need to be applied by countries neighbouring the EU until such time , of course , as we manage to break free , once and for all , from the nightmare of nuclear power plants .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
Ladies and gentlemen , under the terms of the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , I declare the first sitting of the European Parliament following the elections open .
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability may also lead to political stability in this area , which has been particularly troubled over the years .
Parliament has also improved the text by highlighting the importance of training legal professionals to cooperate and to bring our legal structures closer together through mutual recognition and trust , so that we can integrate the response instruments in order to make the European Union a true area of freedom , justice and security .
What is so difficult about saying that the same should be the case for people in the Middle East ?
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , this debate comes at a very timely juncture for tourism , the air travel industry and consumer protection .
Therefore I support the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , which aim to strike the right balance between the privacy and security of individuals on the web , while fully respecting their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Of course , this is a democracy : we are debating the issue and it is an attractive debate .
I am pleased that the European Parliament can at last enter Mecca and debate the kinds of future orientations that should be adopted in this regard .
The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible ; it must do so now , so that the Roma can also benefit from it .
They must also be justified by legitimate interests : national security , public safety , prevention of disorder or crime , protection of health or morals and so on .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am representing the High Commissioner and I am representing the Commission .
We need to act quickly , not just with regard to Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan - which we will be discussing shortly - but also in relation to Iraq .
Lastly , the ALDE Group is very disappointed that , on the eve of the summit , Russia has imposed a disproportional import ban on vegetables from the EU .
It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often tarnishes the image of the EU , is often not the fault of any EU institution but of the Member State itself .
This draft language law jeopardises the use of minority languages in every aspect of life , which also affects , for instance , the half a million-strong indigenous Hungarian minority who live there .
in writing . - ( DE ) The dairy sector is currently in the midst of a crisis on an unprecedented scale : producer prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are fighting for survival .
We welcome the rejection of the proposal from the European Commission , presided over by Mr Dur√£o Barroso , which aimed to exclude &apos; self-employed &apos; road transport workers from the directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , as a result of our proposal to reject the Commission proposal .
Within this context , high-profile Europeans , political parties , the public in their demonstrations and European trade unions are arguing that Eurobonds can play a key role in overcoming the debt crisis and safeguarding the stability of the euro .
We should not now lower this ambition .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Explanations of vote
Secondly , we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers .
SMEs are the motor of the European economy and producers of sustainable growth , creating numerous quality jobs .
Other factors , such as actually giving proper weight to German as a working language , as laid down in the treaties , have been ignored .
The longer we are without an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme , the greater the risk of a terrorist attack that could have been prevented .
Mr President , this is a recurring debate in Parliament .
That also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education , research and innovation as cornerstones of a sustainable social market economy , and of a sustainable and more environmentally conscious economy .
It is regrettable that the resolution has come much later than the statements by certain Heads of State and UN officials about the deployment of tens of thousands of US troops in the country .
The costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only increase as the EU expands further .
This has not been done .
That may all seem a long way away , but if the brave people of Burma can learn anything from us in this Parliament in Europe , it is that the light of liberty can never be extinguished by tyranny and that the freedom that is their inalienable right will surely once again be theirs one day .
What is needed is for us to approach this in solidarity with one another , with a coordinated , rather than an &apos; every man for himself &apos; approach , and that we do not attempt to clip each others &apos; wings .
The agenda will be followed by three documents on broadband : firstly , broadband communication , which details the implementation of the agenda with respect to broadband ; secondly , the recommendation on new generation access ( NGA ) , which aims to clarify the basis to encourage investment in high-speed Internet ; and thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will form the basis of the Commission &apos;s strategy to generate enough spectrum for wireless broadband .
This aim of this directive is clear enough : we need more organs for patients and greater cooperation between Member States on this matter and on combating organ trafficking .
Far too little was done during the process of rescuing the banks to respond to this predictable development .
As far as production and employment are concerned , today , there remain only a few niches in the mid-range / high-end , luxury and high-technology sectors .
It damages confidence when a government subjects its banks to a stress test in the summer and only a few months later realises that it was really a stress test for the euro and not for the banks .
I enthusiastically welcome the adoption of this report , since , as it deals with promoting research and innovation , which are engines of the European Union &apos;s current and future growth , it gives voice to the common sentiments of the people most affected by it : the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of projects , whilst simultaneously strengthening the scientific and technological evaluation process .
Composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
I believe that it is up to the political parties and the parliamentary groups that are against such populism and demagogy to speak out more .
On the subject of the current emergency measures , I would like to draw attention to the fact that the increase in the minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems for Member States in a more difficult budgetary situation .
( The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m. )
I would ask you if , in your concluding comments , you could address some of those very real issues , so that people realise that they are being discussed .
You have just mentioned five points , but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will mean that the economic issues , the social issues , the environmental issues will also be dealt with - is getting lost , or at least we see a risk of that happening .
These are not my words .
As a result , a vast majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon , including the majority of your own people .
So we have got to be careful about that .
We should fight against this and should support those who are punished in this way .
I am sorry , it is not possible .
I consider restrictive measures and sanctions as an important instrument of EU policy in the areas of foreign and security policy as well as , of course , in questions of justice and the defence of fundamental human rights .
This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises , the cornerstone of our economy .
( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , but I would like to raise one important issue with regard to it .
We have supported this resolution with the clear aim of sending the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs stand side-by-side with the people of Haiti in the long-term work of rebuilding the infrastructure , communities and lives which have been torn apart .
We are evidently determined to maintain our support for such actions and to continue to deal with the issue within the European Union , not only in the context of violence prevention and victim support , but also in the areas of immigration , asylum and criminal justice .
Written Statements ( Rule 149 )
Many EU Member States are jointly culpable when it comes to Guant√°namo because , for example , they granted overflying rights for the illegal transport of prisoners .
According to this programme , trade policy remains a very important tool for addressing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation and fostering economic growth , jobs and prosperity for all citizens in Europe .
Therefore , let us say from our side that the barriers must be removed .
I should like to add one area of concern , namely the admission of products from outside the European Union .
Unfortunately , one then realises that behind many measures there is a deliberate intention to conceal the irresponsibility that we still have in our institutions , including unclearly assigned legislature .
I would like to add to that some political aspects that are significant , because , as has already been said , Tunisia is a society that practises multiparty politics , albeit in a limited fashion , with a quota for the opposition , no doubt , but nevertheless multiparty politics .
We had a problem with designating an additional 18 Members of this House because certain Member States did not actually plan for a procedure , but we decided that representativeness is the most important issue , that this is the principle which we should be guided by and that this House should have a balanced representation as quickly as possible .
As it has already been said here , the sensible utilisation of land , economic and social development that is in harmony with nature , and strengthened cohesion in the European Union are also vital factors for the prevention of catastrophes .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and I look forward to further progress in these relations .
The legal texts before us not only define the framework and set out the main guidelines , but the real , concrete steps to be taken are yet to come .
Furthermore , I think we need to go beyond the proposal right now on greening the internal market , for example , by using green procurement .
I refer to the importance of the amendment that emphasises how the question of observers must be addressed , bearing in mind that these observers must be chosen from among the main candidates who were not elected in the European Parliament elections .
Action taken on Parliament &apos;s resolutions : see Minutes
We can talk about 2020 , but we have a more urgent problem today : the eurozone and Greece .
Information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) represent an important sector , not least , in fact , because of the weight they carry in the European economy : they account for 7 % of the labour force - of the European labour force - and 6 % of GDP , thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too .
I think we can expect a whole host of initiatives asking the Commission to do more , asking for there to be more Europe , and no doubt the Commission will respond enthusiastically to that request .
For if we do not assume our responsibility and take a clear line , then we can forget what was said earlier by Ms Toia : we need to be aware that in 2020 - and we set this out in the Digital Agenda - every European should be able to pursue his or her interests via what are ultimately spectrum opportunities .
Such organisations build their power base by responding to the everyday needs of the people and they then consolidate their power through terror .
Statements by the President
in writing . - I backed the Commission &apos;s radio spectrum policy programme ( RSPP ) because I believe that all EU citizens should have access to a faster broadband connection by 2020 .
The consequences of unrestricted exploitation of its natural resources would be catastrophic , not only for the surrounding area and the indigenous population , but for the world as a whole .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Gy≈ëri on the mandate she currently has , and I wish her and the Hungarian Presidency every success .
We must also go ahead on nanomaterials , and now that the cloning part has been removed , we can move quickly on these .
A fruitful partnership is particularly important in the areas of financial services , economic governance , the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , energy and the internal market .
With regard to the emerging countries - China , South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia - they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them .
The protocol provides for a Union contribution to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe of EUR 682 500 per year , of which EUR 227 500 will go towards support for S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe &apos;s fisheries policy , which I believe to be appropriate .
We will see how it is implemented in the future .
I also hope that the Council will take more seriously Parliament &apos;s efforts in this regard , although I am very saddened and concerned about the fact that the representative of the Council is no longer present .
If we , as Europeans , are to play an active role in this respect , it is essential that we continue to do so .
This report is an additional step towards pushing the European Council , Commission and Member States to act on homelessness .
For example , in the case of expulsion , the family must be allowed to choose whether to follow or to remain where they are .
This appalling agreement was concluded on the sly and ratified one August back in the 1980s .
The negotiations with Japan , aimed at strengthening trade relations , cannot be used as a class weapon in the service of big financial institutions and companies , promoting the increased exploitation of workers and peoples , the destruction of their productive strength , and the destruction of the environment .
We confirm that we will deliver on what we have been obliged to do , and as has been promised in the IIA , on budget reform by the end this year .
Between July and August , in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in the mining district of eastern Congo alone , more than 500 people , including children , girls , and women as old as 75 , were victims of gang rapes .
Thus , the initial draft of the report , which made provision for the realisation of a House of European History with exorbitant running costs , was absolutely contrary to my firm belief in budgetary restraint where public money is involved .
After all , these are investments that are not immediately profitable , but are made so that there is a reserve .
I also wish to stress that we can give third countries a helping hand , as the speaker before me said .
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential , even if it does concern only 1 % of national health budgets , because , aside from the figures , what we should be focusing on is the strength of the symbol , which is the legitimate right for every European citizen to be treated abroad and be reimbursed for the treatment received with all the correct information .
Nevertheless , as a form of primary prevention , I call for the implementation of measures to encourage healthy lifestyles as an essential factor in improving health .
In view of the Member States &apos; differing legal regulations and frequently limited influence in terms of enforcing the provisions of international law with regard to the fight against violence , the need for clear and binding regulations at EU level in respect of the problem is becoming ever more apparent .
What is your view of these unplanned liabilities within the euro system ?
Freedom of expression and information , including the freedom to express opinions and the freedom to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure , are social values which many have fought for over the years , including in Portugal .
I believe that we are the ones who can still save this planet .
In short , as we have said so many times , we need cohesion policy that is solid , well-financed and present in all the regions of the European Union .
In principle I share some of these fears , and I also recognise that Turkmenistan still has some way to go before it is fully compliant with international standards on democracy and human rights .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries , particularly in China and India , with damaging effects for countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Ladies and gentlemen - and I address this in particular to Members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - there is no point in us defending one group or another in Ukraine on party-political grounds .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
Mr President , the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the first thing I would like to do is to congratulate the rapporteur , with whom we have very similar views as regards this programme , and secondly to congratulate everyone involved , because in such a time of economic crisis , it is fundamental to maintain a programme like this , with obvious positive social effects .
The Commission is looking forward to developing a special relationship with Parliament also as regards this file .
Mr President , Commissioners , we must ensure that the promises of donations made at the donors &apos; conference henceforth materialise as actual funds , and also actually reach their intended recipients .
It is this committee that makes the citizen-focused policy that is needed , particularly in the context of the crisis we are seeing at the moment .
The European Council must make the necessary preparations , but should not jump to any hasty conclusions .
If Portugal were not seeing several companies closing week after week , it would not be seeing so many Portuguese people unemployed and living in poverty .
By setting up a trust fund , as proposed by the Party of European Socialists , we would ensure that Member States coming under attack from unscrupulous speculators could be supported without direct recourse to taxpayers and could ensure lower spreads .
Of the new cases of infringement in 2007 , 1 196 concerned a failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives .
I think there is a balance to strike between environmental protection , on the one hand , and on bureaucracy and cost to industry and smaller installations , such as farmers and healthcare installations , on the other .
The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of that strategy .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating my friend , Mrs Weber , on the fine work she has accomplished in this report .
I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission seem to see eye to eye on many priorities here .
In fact , it hands international and domestic road transport over to the large monopolies on a plate .
- Report : Klaus-Heiner Lehne
If antibiotics are used on such a large scale , it is no surprise that strains of bacteria arise which do not then respond to antibiotics .
This directive does not adopt the principle of protecting migrant workers and safeguarding those who , being forced to work in unacceptable conditions , report them .
I am very glad that we have rejected the draft , which was only on the order of business so that the Left could attack its political opponents in Italy .
You are quite right .
It is true that heated debates took place in the Council on the best ways to ensure that peripheral Member States do not feel locked out , and eventually a qualified majority was formed in the Council , and I hope - and I believe that the discussion has shown this as well - in Parliament , too .
Adopting Amendment 43 should not make Amendment 54 fall , because in 54 there are also other issues which are not covered by 43 .
Order of business
Climate change is not the only environmental problem we face but it is imperative that we attempt to address it in Copenhagen .
However , no new body is needed to provide it or to define and monitor conditionality .
- ( HU ) I welcome the decision of the Council with regard to the position to be put forward at the G20 summit .
We should consider whether we need new sources of income , in which case we need look no further than those who have always profited from this unspeakable situation .
in writing . - As a fervent opponent of the EU and its continual meddling in our lives , I have consistently voted against the vast majority of reports that I have been asked to consider .
It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tool that is now being increasingly used by the European Parliament due to the difficult stage of economic convergence our continent is experiencing .
I demand that this Judge Afiuni and all prisoners in Venezuela are treated with dignity and are afforded a scrupulously fair trial .
Some honourable Members have asked about Gaza , about making sure that the aid is getting through , that we continue to support the people of Gaza - which we do , but we are engaged in a dialogue to increase and improve that .
I voted in favour of this report also because it calls for a more transparent , simpler and fairer financing system for the European Union .
Although the European Union has to have relations with the Russian Government , we must remind that Government at all times that we demand that the democratic state and the democratic ethos should always prevail , and that attempts to censor views that are not acceptable to the Government , or to put politicians under unfair pressure , will not be acceptable to the European Union .
( NL ) Mr President , unfortunately , the giants - the United States , China , India , Brazil - were not joined by a European giant in Copenhagen .
Mr President , honourable Members , my conviction is that research and innovation are not an option for Europe , but a necessity if we want a long-term solution that protects our social model and the sustainability of our environment .
It is clear that the aim is to conserve raw materials by seeking to obtain more attractive exchange rates for their export .
You can go for it .
Developing countries claim correctly they did not cause this crisis .
With regard to this course of action , the European Union should play its part by giving thought , at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form , to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and , at the same time , by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue , which should never be lost , even at difficult times .
As the current directive does not appear to be effective enough in discouraging late payments , I also support the strengthening of the existing rules .
Since that time , it has first of all become clear to us that the US is far more open to these reservations and to finding constructive solutions to the European reservations than we had previously thought .
In fact , Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election .
I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd : in the United States , the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited , but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene .
The most effective tool of the European Union to combat unemployment is the European Social Fund , the rules of which we are now considerably simplifying in order to speed up payments .
I think now we must allow time for this package to be transposed : to implement it and see how it works before deciding whether anything is needed .
New areas were added in order to enhance cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of mercenary activities ; the fight against the manufacturing of , trade in and accumulation of small arms and light weapons ; and cooperation on migration .
I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy .
The first is that , despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people , we must not lose sight of the principles .
The resolution explicitly mentions and criticises measures introduced by the current government , but forgets that the current Mayor of Naples , Mrs Iervolino , belongs to the centre-left and , worse still , forgets the long reign of Mr Bassolino , who was Mayor of Naples from 1993 to 2000 and Governor of Campania from 2000 to 2010 , as well as special commissioner for the waste crisis for many years .
Stand up and fight for democracy once again .
Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any , or hardly any , proof .
On this point , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the report falls short : it still sets too many conditions for prior approval , making it difficult for Member States .
The future of this region needs solid , tolerant democracies that respect minorities and in which the state is promised to all and not abused by the few .
I very much hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011 , in order to create an area for economic growth and for the resolution of financial difficulties .
Therefore , in general , the overwhelming majority of interested parties , including professional associations , agrees with the &apos; English-only &apos; option .
The only way forward for working men and women is disobedience and insubordination towards the decisions by the European Union and its institutions .
At the same time , political dialogue has now ground to a halt .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I propose an oral amendment for a split vote on paragraph 10 , concerning the following passage : &apos; considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate &apos; .
We have to raise this target and we will raise it , but only when the circumstances are right .
It is essential that we in the EU take action NOW .
As far as financial services are concerned , I agree that there is a need for service providers to implement a certain level of transparency , but I have certain doubts about the formulation used in your draft .
The budget underlying this report - which is made explicit in the first item of the compromise proposal &apos;s preamble , accepting an end to dairy quotas - is unacceptable to us , which is why we voted against .
Madam President , this is very good news indeed .
We will spare no effort to make everything clear .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to point out that I am unable to make my speech in Catalan since it is not yet an official language , even though it is the language of more than 10 million European citizens .
The Union must modernise its energy infrastructures and provide interconnections between Member States &apos; energy infrastructures .
If Russia cannot accept Ukraine &apos;s political direction , it will have to get over it , as it got over the loss of political influence over the countries of the Soviet bloc .
In this regard , I would like to remind you of the decision , adopted yesterday in plenary , whereby we rejected a resolution on the Aminatou Haidar case so as not to compromise the ongoing diplomatic negotiations .
Mr President , we are talking about the situation in Belarus , but let us not pass the buck .
The major producing countries , supported by a majority of MEPs who are sensitive to the industry &apos;s arguments , have succeeded in preventing us from setting an ambitious emissions reduction target .
We had tremendous cooperation in bringing together what I believe is a very strong report that sets out a clear vision of where this Parliament wants to see the CAP head after 2013 .
The example of the United States shows that flexibility is not synonymous with insecurity , but rather with a dynamic job market ..
As President of the European Commission , I will subscribe to the principles laid down in the resolution you have just adopted .
We must now send out a clear signal in terms of accountability to those who hold in their hands the future of this key treaty for the Union , for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans that we represent .
All are examples of the benefits of animal research .
Documents received : see Minutes
Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work , because far beyond the EUR 146 million that have been agreed , the impact of which we hope will be eight-fold , this initiative has important symbolic value .
I believe that Europe &apos;s cultural spirit is an important way of bringing Europeans closer together in a manner which fully respects their different cultural and linguistic identities .
I believe that it is very important to promote not only competitiveness in the agricultural sector , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution .
Special derogations were also permitted for remote rural areas and islands , like Orkney and Shetland in my own constituency , for instance , where longer journey times are unavoidable .
The policies being applied are angering and disappointing our citizens and the decision-making procedures discourage their participation , as the recent European elections demonstrated .
Regarding the delay , you are right : there is some delay .
The resolution calls on the Commission urgently to respond to the legitimate concerns of the petitioner - who has been experiencing this intolerable situation for 13 years and has consequently suffered considerable loss of earnings - and to take the necessary steps to enable the petitioner to assert his rights
The way to achieve these objectives is full support , effective implementation and sufficient respect for existing laws and instruments relating to the protection of human rights and civic freedoms .
Never before has the European project been subject to such a tough test .
What are we going to do when the Americans , as the dollar is falling , sell their gas-guzzling , subsidised and highly promoted 4x4s on our market , which is also under siege from bottom-of-the-range vehicles from Turkey , India and China ?
Mr President , I would like to ask for your assessment of the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place almost a fortnight ago .
We demand common , European solutions .
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out , if these points were to be clarified , the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate .
It is very important that we , as Europeans , ensure that we also take the European message to Belarus , thereby offering a prospect of hope there .
The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is just more of the same , with a few extra glimmers of democratic lucidity .
It is obvious that these measures only offer a partial , incomplete solution to illegal immigration and black labour .
Be under no illusion : we are very clear , I am very clear , with all of the leaders I speak to about what I believe needs to happen , and I do so with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States .
I am not exaggerating : one of these reports feels it necessary to state that in the event of a change in majority after an election , the new government must obtain authorisation before altering its predecessor &apos;s budget priorities , and even then can only do so around the edges .
Better still , whilst our political differences naturally remain unchanged , our relationship as people has been noticeably enriched .
Therefore , for us it is important to go much further than the pilot project that you mentioned , Commissioner .
Basically , nuclear energy is established in a way that means that each country has a nuclear safety regulator who has full responsibility for implementing nuclear safety measures .
But the interesting thing is that , while it is true that a number of countries have problems because of the financial crisis , it is also true - as I think Mr Lamberts will recognise and appreciate - that in most of the countries which are taking a stable view on public finances , the governments are non-Socialist .
Various scenarios are possible , ranging from a peaceful takeover of power by the pro-democratic forces to economic chaos and the outbreak of armed conflict , and even the use of nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out .
In our increasingly elderly society , the number of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer &apos;s or senile dementia will continue to increase .
On the question of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the issue of changes to the European Social Fund , I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation , because the dialogue has been so constructive that the achievement of our aims is within reach at this meeting , and I consider that to be extremely important .
What about also encouraging Member States , as soon as they have applied for the EGF , to start putting in place themselves the measures that they have applied for under the EGF , because that at least would ensure that workers would not be waiting for the application of the Fund ?
These strategies and programmes cannot just remain on paper because they would only serve to highlight inconsistency and a lack of confidence in the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
I cannot imagine how anyone could feel comfortable doing a favour to this oppressive regime by supporting the amendments that provide an opportunity for Iran to attack and weaken the opposition movement that has been advocating for human rights and democracy in Iran .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law as I do not believe Brussels should be making legislation where national legislation already exists .
With his election as President , he brought hope and change , not only in the United States but for the whole world and also in Europe .
To that end , I am in favour of the proposals presented by the Commission to Parliament , many of which have already been addressed in my report on the Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders .
However , we object to the wording in paragraph 8 , which states that a gradual and sharp reduction in the tax burden on mid to low-level salaries and pensions must be introduced , with tax deductions , revised tax rates and compensation for fiscal drag .
In many cases where the government of a country has long failed to participate in dialogue or programmes to improve the situation in question , country-specific resolutions represent the only remaining action that the international community can take against these crimes .
We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new Parliament .
These exceptions , however , should only apply when they can be justified on account of their significance in relation to security policy .
The Co-Chairs have also appealed to the LTTE to lay down their arms but unfortunately , this call has been rejected , even ignored .
I agree with the possibility of calling for structural reforms in surplus countries , but most attention should be given to deficit countries .
I would therefore ask that a roll-call vote be taken on the second part of paragraph 12 .
Nonetheless , I am glad that Parliament has shown such clear determination by such a clear majority to settle the issue in the way that we have now decided .
That is our European path , and it may differ from other paths .
The project , the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption ( ESVAC ) , started in the third quarter of 2009 .
Given the crucial role played by research in economic development and job creation , it is important to avoid at all costs excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays which prevent the scientific community from participating .
The banks are in the black and yet are applauded when it emerges that they are voluntarily contributing a bit to Greece .
This document shows that Member States are managing increasingly well with the transposition of EU law .
The best way of reducing population growth is to save the lives of youngsters , so that people do not feel the need to have bigger families .
I therefore welcome the proposal to lay down clear rules for the definition of the aforesaid categories of wine-based products , so that the high quality of European produce may always be recognised and identified .
An initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all .
I feel that particular attention must be focused on corridor 7 .
We therefore warmly welcome this communication , which shows new ambition for single market policies , allowing us to restore confidence in our social market economy model .
( The speaker agrees to answer the question of another Member , in accordance with Rule 149 ( 8 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
As you will be aware , a second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday in Ukraine .
The Hungarian Government should provide an effective guarantee of freedom and pluralism in the media , and should therefore revoke the law , or modify it substantially , based on the observations and proposals of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe , the Council of the European Union and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights , and by means of an open , transparent debate in which all stakeholders , non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) and citizens can participate .
The Pr√ºm Treaty was forced into European law without proper democratic scrutiny .
I would also like to remind our liberal fellow Members , and , in particular , Mr Rohde , that the reason he was in favour of free trade was because of its devastating effects , since he maintained that the fact that the British bourgeoisie was driven by dishonourable interests was of little consequence : Indian society needed to be destroyed in order to precipitate the dawn of the global revolution .
Ladies and gentlemen , Kenya is acting in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples &apos; Rights .
First , civil protection is a competence of the Member States , and all coordination initiatives must be built on this basis .
In 2008 , the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions wrote that &apos; These killings have eliminated civil society leaders , including human rights defenders , trade unionists and land reform advocates , intimidated a vast number of civil society actors , and narrowed the country &apos;s political discourse . &apos;
I disagree with the last speaker because I believe , if we do pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it gives us the opportunity to connect citizens to the EU in a much more meaningful way .
We are at our highest level in terms of civilisation and in terms of weapons , more so than in the Cold War , which is a far cry from pragmatic policies moving towards demilitarisation .
This will allow us to say that we are going to establish real , effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States .
I believe - and this is a positive message I shall take away with me if the House follows our lead by what I hope will be an equally large majority tomorrow - that we have ensured that control does indeed work .
In addition , we have endeavoured to make as clear as possible our wish not only for public stations with high quality , attractive content , but also for the integration of new platforms , taking into account the latest technologies .
Madam President , in Ireland two years ago , in December 2008 , we had a problem .
Although we cannot expect miracles from the agreement , it is a step in the right direction , which is why I have voted in favour of this report .
Once again , it is an intergovernmental mechanism which was concocted within Ecofin and which requires unanimity .
This goes against the actual aim of regional support , namely the strengthening of the weakest regions .
One symbol , one conclusion - that is what we should all be working towards together .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
However , the only way in which we will be able to give the required scope to our action is with a clear commitment from the Libyan authorities .
In this way we are of course already sending a strong signal to the future renewed institutions : to Parliament , naturally , but also to the Commission .
There is also the risk of the real criminals adapting to the profile by using innocent-looking people as drug mules or suicide bombers or by changing travel routes away from those monitored .
Another essential element is greater access to schools , higher level vocational and academic training , and an improvement of social conditions for women in rural areas .
Despite that , there are still further challenges .
The EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in the ACP countries and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
In my view , the most important point in this connection is the need to agree a new budget for Europe and the European Union in the next few years .
The EU must give primary importance to research and innovation in tackling challenges such as climate change and finding solutions to increasing global competition .
Europe is divided on this issue .
This is good news , and we must thank all those who , in the Member States , and sometimes in the regions , are responsible for implementing this directive .
According to the United Nations , 20-40 % of world timber production is the result of illegal logging .
I know she is about to leave this place and , though we do not always agree on issues , I think everyone will agree that she has done a tremendous amount of work on this report .
This proposal , which is supported by the Council of Europe , has long been awaited by all those who campaign for respect for the integration rights of marginalised communities , and particularly of the Roma .
Failure to do this would render unlawful any act this Parliament takes on the basis of a 754-strong Chamber - three over the limit of 751 .
Not so long ago , however , we discussed the Digital Agenda ; we all agree on the Digital Agenda ; and this issue is a major one for the Digital Agenda .
I would like to thank you for making this debate a truly joint debate .
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the ICTY is a condition of EU accession but the truth is , as Commissioner Orban candidly told me last night in the absence of Commissioner Rehn , that there is no unanimity in the Council as to what that means .
The Arctic Council has concentrated on environmental and research cooperation , but the agreements that focus on the use of natural resources have brought with them a growing need to develop international administration strategies , and the EU , too , may have a role to play here .
However , I strongly support a very strict approach concerning access to the occupation of road transport operator .
As we opened our markets when we joined the European Union we pay the same amount of money into the budget and many other things besides .
Unfortunately , at the moment , there is no European mechanism or institution capable of coordinating an integrated continental recovery and therefore we are reapplying patchwork solutions that may fail as a whole , since Member States &apos; economies are highly interdependent .
Let me only say that as regards our own communication , we are giving the clear definition of price stability which permits everybody to judge what we are doing permanently in real time .
On the issue of judicial training , the Council shares Parliament &apos;s opinion that there is a need to foster a genuine EU judicial culture by , inter alia , promoting direct exchanges between judges , prosecutors and members of the judicial staff of different Member States , and to actively develop the European Judicial Training Network .
We should make a common effort in this direction in the future .
However , this did not happen .
However , I would remind the House - this is something that we faced in Greece recently in important cases - that , even now , there are people being prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or manage to get off and escape arrest by making use of the different procedural provisions and different regulations in the various national laws .
A general framework was also created where individual elements can complement and reinforce each other .
Before the vote :
The most important message of our debate today for Member States must be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria that the European Union expected from countries that have joined so far .
The existence of European-level contract law , which has been debated at length within the institutions , could represent a range of benefits for businesses , for consumers and for the smooth running of the Internal Market .
It is politically unacceptable that this report , which contains incorrect facts , was voted in plenary today ( 24 November 2009 ) .
Indeed , we cannot , on the one hand , criticise the United States for years about the Guant√°namo centre and , on the other , fail to show much will or ambition on our side in order to help it solve this problem .
That is why we voted against it .
The phenomenon of emigration fuelled by situations of crisis and instability has negative implications for the origin country , the destination country and the displaced populations themselves .
Madam President , I do not know what really happened , but I would like to speak as a draftsperson for the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) .
For Serbia , persons resident in Kosovo , or persons of Kosovan origin who are resident abroad and who hold a Serbian passport issued by a central authority in Belgrade , will be excluded from the liberalisation and will be required to obtain a visa .
Passengers should have the choice between receiving a refund for the price of the ticket or continuing their journey under the same conditions and at no additional cost .
Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are actually complied with .
This question was submitted by me on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport and Tourism , as Members had become very concerned over the summer months by the collapse of SkyEurope airline , and approached me to take this initiative on their behalf .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
First , we need to overcome the imbalances resulting from the increasing divergence between life expectancy and retirement ages .
Proposals :
What is under discussion is whether we believe that we can get all the details , including the form of the agreement , in place in Mexico .
The OSCE is rapidly usurping the Council of Europe as the principal and most relevant forum for discussing democracy - with its ODIHR branch supporting election monitoring - human rights and the rule of law in Europe .
The compromise is a good one and I very much hope that during the vote tomorrow it will meet with broad approval .
It is not long since I reminded Parliament that elections are not free in Belarus , that freedom of expression , association and protest do not exist and that there have been an increasing number of repressive activities directed by the authorities .
A claim should be scientifically substantiated by taking into account the totality of the scientific data available , and by weighing up the evidence .
Of course , this information is highly relevant for patients and healthcare professionals but , due to its potential abuse for promotion , it needs a strict framework .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , repeated accidents and an increase in the transport of dangerous goods by sea constantly raise acute issues regarding strengthening the safety rules governing all maritime straits in the European Union and the resources needed in order to enforce these rules .
The second topic is nuclear power .
Then we will have the technical part , which includes transferring this to a legally binding text .
It is therefore essential for the social clause to appear more and more frequently in bilateral agreements .
Here we have a good opportunity to demonstrate this in practice .
Tuesday :
To enhance this practical cooperation , the establishment of the Asylum Support Office was requested by the European Pact on Asylum and Migration of 2008 and agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009 .
This week , we celebrated 8 March .
Madam President , I thank the honourable Member for this remark , but I would like to inform her that I am a representative of Poland , not Lithuania .
Mr President , I am pleased that the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs can be presented in plenary after all ; that was not the case a few weeks ago .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Garc√≠a P√©rez , Mrs J√∂ns and Mr Angelaka , who have submitted excellent reports , and all the Members who have spoken .
I know that these events have been followed by many Members of this Parliament as well as our respective national parliaments throughout Europe .
We will therefore reiterate our appeal to Russia to do its utmost to ensure that human rights defenders can carry out their work without having to live in fear of violence , harassment or threats .
Moreover , needless complications might undermine the legitimacy and popularity of the process of EU accession to the convention .
Opening of the sitting
I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government , which has many other matters to attend to : its own refugees - as has been said - and overseeing its democratic transition process .
We need to continue to pursue economic , social and territorial cohesion policies in order to narrow the disparities between regions and establish a platform for balanced economic development , as is also stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon .
The vote will take place next .
Human rights groups have accused Google of helping the Chinese Government in repressing its citizens and particularly human rights activists .
The main issue at this point in time is to speedily amend the proposed directive and get it on the road to implementation as soon as possible .
Faced with such a situation , I propose , as I did before , that an Eastern Neighbourhood assembly , Euroeast , with the participation of the European Parliament and based on the principles of the Euromed and EuroLat assemblies , be created with a view to implementing the ENPI in the countries of Eastern Europe .
The key issue that we need to discuss is financing the European budget and future Financial Perspectives .
We have to inform our citizens of what it means , and how they can utilise the tools that we are giving them with this directive so that they do not succumb to the pitfall of being drawn into purchasing falsified medicines .
It is very important to create a level playing field for credit rating agencies by stimulating competition , transparency , market opening and stability .
It is estimated that there are currently 200 000 to 300 000 children directly involved in armed conflicts in over 20 countries around the world .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Espinosa , Commissioner , the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an evaluation of the Copenhagen climate conference , while we are saying here , according to many speakers , that it ended in a fiasco .
These improvements are crucial as a way of promoting the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) in future .
Commissioner , you have cited the Lisbon Strategy , innovation , the green economy , and you know that this European strategy is now a failure .
No , it wants to continue paying out export refunds .
( DE ) Madam President , in the case of any country , it is important to consider its origins and whether the developments in the area of human and minority rights are moving in the right direction .
It is also essential for fishing companies to be encouraged through legislation to use the best equipment currently available in terms of selectivity , and thereby to avoid catching such huge quantities of under-sized fish and fish other than the target species , or by-catches .
We will continue to press forward on this .
As the Commissioner has rightly pointed out , for many years , our main competitors and economic partners have had origin marking for goods that enter their territory .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday 20 May , at 12.00 .
While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World , a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam - an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state .
In addition , we are in constant contact with third countries , in particular Russia , to ask them to lift their ban , which is considered disproportionate .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Hahn , the proposals that are now on the table are like putting a large rucksack on the backs of all those who are already finding things difficult enough and telling them they have to run faster with it on .
Once again , I salute their courage and determination .
At the same time , the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy which has operated hitherto in several Member States will obviously remain to haunt the European Union for some years to come .
First among them is that science is a global discipline and advances we can share go towards increasing the sum total of human endeavour .
I would say : no more rules .
With its popularity rating in free fall and in the wake of a set of austerity measures of brutal severity , having a drastic impact on living standards , the Romanian Government is resorting to increasingly violent antidemocratic methods to hold on to power .
Let us reclaim utopia , and utopia for peace !
We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and we want to ensure by means of controls and transparency that we achieve the target of 20 % and that nothing goes wrong in Europe .
It also proposed more funding opportunities for projects in this area , namely in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the EU Public Health Programme , the Youth and Citizenship programmes and the Lifelong Learning Programme .
In view of the fact that there are only seven members of the panel and that their task is a very responsible one , it is important they be persons of impeccable reputation and high ability .
Even if we are unable to offer them the prospect of membership in the near future , we should develop economic and political cooperation for the sake of the common European good .
Following a public consultation last year , the Commission is evaluating the comments about collective redress and intends to find a solution that meets European consumers &apos; needs without importing US practices .
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best kind of active dialogue with European citizens is one based on listening to what they say in democratic votes .
I think that the debate this evening has shown an extraordinary consensus of view around Parliament on , for example , the appointment by the EU of a special coordinator for Tibet .
I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens .
It is a fine example and a benchmark and it is a lesson being given to us by the second-poorest country on the planet : as we entered the court , we saw the slogan &apos; no peace without justice &apos; .
In this situation , cooperation between the Union and Council is vital for guaranteeing energy requirements and avoiding a rise in the oil price on the global market .
If we fail to provide a clear answer to these questions , the two targets relating to employment growth and the reduction in the poverty level will meet the same fate as the Lisbon Agenda .
- Before the vote :
Mr Amado said : &apos; I did not talk about it so as not to disrupt the serenity of the European institutions &apos; .
I hope 2010 will be a very good year for Croatia and for the Western Balkans too , but I would also like to underline the necessity of considering and adequately addressing the issue of refugees and the internally displaced persons .
I know it is not easy .
Madam President , I would like to add to the calls for this proposal to be withdrawn and for the Commission to submit a new one with a different legal basis .
There are plenty of review clauses built in here to ensure this works , but I very much echo what Diana Wallis says that the exemptions were crucial for the compromise .
The Commission &apos;s position is commendable : it makes the Member States responsible for the safe management , including disposal , of the spent fuel and radioactive waste that they generate , through the development of their own programmes .
I think this text represents another instrument for the EU to use as it outlines a coherent and effective policy on the phenomenon of migration flows , directing its choices on the most appropriate path towards recreating conditions of political , economic and social stability .

on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it rather borders on political provocation when this Europe 2020 programme is presented as a great strategy for getting us further out of the crisis .
We have decided on the five targets , amongst which is social inclusion ; it is a competence of the European Union under the Treaty .
Recently , we have been able to see the significance of the problem addressed by the legislation we have adopted , as several million households around the European Union have exchanged their CRT television sets for modern LCD screens .

I cannot fail to stress the need to ensure the quality of products sold within Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them .

This report takes a wide-ranging approach to the forestry issue , focusing on certain aspects which we believe to be important .
The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement ; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114 .
It is evident that the majority of tasks will have to be undertaken by the governments of Serbia and Macedonia and , as Mrs Malmstr√∂m mentioned , it is they who must provide information to their citizens .
Against the background of the difficult market situation and the discussion which has been initiated about the future of agricultural policy in the EU , Parliament needs to make a clear commitment to giving all areas of agricultural production the necessary security to allow them to plan for the future .
What measures does it intend to take on the &apos; activity &apos; of credit rating agencies ?
It is worth stressing the fact that volunteering unquestionably has a positive influence on the developing identity of Europe , which has its roots in these values and is a good basis for developing understanding between citizens of the different social groups and countries of the entire European society .
Ladies and gentlemen , the proposal amending the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is one of the most important measures which Parliament has adopted , in terms of both increasing European citizens &apos; quality of life and promoting the EU &apos;s economic recovery .
Belgium received a pledge from the previous presidencies that Parliament would be involved in the debate on this multiannual financial framework .
Reserving spectrum for new entrants may be an appropriate tool in certain cases , but with a view to avoiding unnecessary procedures ; we would then be close to each other .
Nobody would understand - but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite .
The institutional aspects of the creation of a European external action service - Creation of a European external action service : State of the negotiations with Member States ( debate )
When you delve behind the mystifying and Manichean language , the aim is clear : the EU does not accept the affirmation of sovereignty of Belarus and its definition of an independent policy , which is not in thrall to to the interests of the EU / NATO / US , and is trying to get round it .
The report recommends in particular : promoting the education and training of health staff and paramedical staff , with particular attention being paid to nosocomial infections and the resistance to antivirals of the viruses that cause them ; improving knowledge of this problem amongst patients by asking the Commission to draw up a document for patients on the basis of a handbook for the prevention of nosocomial infections produced by the World Health Organization - the WHO - in 2003 ; supporting research in this area , with particular attention being paid to new technologies , nanotechnologies and nanomaterials ; and increasing the presence of nurses and specialist infection control nurses .
Verification of credentials : see Minutes
Acts of violence on both sides need to stop in order to make way for transparent dialogue in good faith , putting an end to a conflict which has already caused too many deaths and is still resulting in large numbers of displaced people and refugees .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is still a mystery how the Council could have treated an issue such as this so lightly .
While the EU budget is a major political lever , the ceiling on the EU &apos;s own resources has remained unchanged since 1993 .
Since these islands are dependent on tourism , and tourism is in decline , there is a growing threat of unemployment and the collapse of small and medium-sized business and this would hit the inhabitants of these far off islands particularly hard .
Some affirmations therefore need to be put into perspective by means of amendments .
That is what a Norwegian doctor said to me , who is operating every day and working round the clock ( we are sending doctors to Gaza ) .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , let me first join you in paying tribute to Jean Monnet .
We should not allow this political crisis and tensions to go any further .
The distribution of CAP resources between farmers in the European Union , which is at the top of the public dialogue agenda , requires care .
However , I voted against the report because , while the general framework is right , some of the features proposed by my fellow Member are unacceptable .
However , I agree with the Parliament &apos;s amendments that remove the recommendations on automatic sanctions on Member States that incur an excessive deficit because , as this crisis has shown , it is necessary , in extraordinary circumstances , to exceed the deficit requirements in order to stave off more serious economic effects of a crisis .
At the moment , this tragedy can be witnessed in Lampedusa ; and it is a grave tragedy .
The problems which have emerged due to the implementation of these regulations lead to inconsistencies regarding exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility for EU financing of costs related to taxes , duties and other charges .

Its President Maystadt held a conference two days ago at which he demonstrated how much the EIB had spent since the crisis started - about EUR 10 billion more than in the previous year .
Just as commendable , moreover , is the anticipated - to &apos; anticipated &apos; I would add &apos; desirable &apos; - option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers .
Mr Oettinger , you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050 .
The rebates which the British have , and which the Dutch and the Danes want , that is a bankrupt system .
We will also discuss joint responses to economic challenges .
The right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports .
With today &apos;s vote Parliament has adopted the mandate for the trialogue on the 2012 budget .
This report and the debate is also a valuable and appreciated input for another time when we can discuss it on a broader scale .
This is why , today , I was delighted to endorse the resolution prepared by Mr Papanikolaou .
I should like to hear from the Commission whether this will be included in the adapted version of the communication and whether the responsibilities will be assigned appropriately , namely to the Member States , even though these will be accompanied by rules for services of general interest that should be drawn up in consultation with the European Parliament and the Council .
We should have set a cut-off point , but we failed to do so and now we have to continue and hope against hope for success .
No requests yet from the Chilean authorities , but of course it could be directed under both headlines to reconstruction .
The hope is that the Commission and the Council will work consistently with one another on these guidelines , and , above all , will do so with a sense of urgency which , unfortunately , has been inexcusably lacking in other , even recent , cases .
At bottom , its intention is the criminalisation of communists , their activities and their ideals .

Mr President , may I express my solidarity and brotherly affection to the people of Chile after the terrible earthquakes and tsunami they experienced in Concepci√≥n , Biob√≠o , Temuco and Valpara√≠so .
It is not just a matter of structures and rules , then , but of mentality .
The latest statistics show that the EU posted a trade deficit of EUR 17.3 billion in August 2010 .
At the end of the day , implementation of these commitments will be crucial for the progressive resumption of our budgetary support programmes .
I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Requesting an opinion from the Court of Justice on the compatibility with the Treaties of the Protocol on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement ( motion for a resolution tabled ) : see Minutes
That in itself was a challenge .
It has clearly shown that we are unable to act on our own in times of crisis and to ensure prosperity for our people .
In many respects I admire my own group &apos;s basic positions .
It is quite a step forward , quite a step in the right direction to have this type of operation .
Could the Commission indicate to what extent it will take account of these rulings which once again demonstrate the reluctance on the part of the airlines , the overly vague wording of Regulation No. 261 / 2004 concerning the &apos; extraordinary circumstances &apos; justifying a cancellation and the passivity of the Commission in the face of numerous violations of this regulation to the detriment of passengers ?
We all know that freedom of the media is under pressure in several Member States ( see the most recent Press Freedom Index report , published yesterday by Reporters Without Borders ) .

- ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the economic partnership agreement between the Cariforum and the European Union is inaugurating something bad for the outermost regions ( ORs ) of the French West Indies and Guyana .

I welcome the measures proposed by the European Commission to help Europe &apos;s dairy producers .
I think there is one thing we could stop doing , and that is ridiculing Greece .
Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council , which it is only too familiar with .
That is why I voted for the report on the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions .
It is important to manage this , and the European Parliament resolution passed today helps in this respect .
The Commission will draw on the work by the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will collect and analyse data and statistics on this subject .
In addition , these measures would damage the Union &apos;s external trade policy by making it more complicated to conclude future free trade agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral .
However , since this report makes very reasonable arguments in this regard , I voted in favour .

We are happy that our prohibition on CMR substances has been retained , but made more appropriate .
I welcome the rapid action on the part of the Commission and of Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive .
It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism .
In view of the global financial crisis and the ever-growing level of consumer debt , active dialogue with Europe &apos;s citizens means that European institutions and civil society need to make efforts to improve consumers &apos; level of financial education , particularly with regard to their rights and obligations , as well as the best practices in the areas of savings and loans .
There will be a framework agreement and then there will be a rapid decision-making mechanism about the size of the assistance .
We cannot allow political arguments to delay the enlargement .
1. it is time to recognise all mass media in the Internet ;
There is no dilemma between &apos; communautarianism &apos; and intergovernmentalism , between merits or quotas , between old and new Member States .
Do not count on me ever to vote in favour of any increase in the budget .
I voted in favour of this report so that these objectives might become a reality in the near future , stimulating harmonious growth not only in different sectors but also in areas of Europe often characterised by heterogeneity on the level of territorial development .
We would ask you to agree to our request to remember this very committed journalist and pioneering fighter for freedom and human rights in Chechnya by observing a minute &apos;s silence .
It is very important to lay down a clearer VAT framework and a common consolidated corporate tax base .
Today , there are as many people living in poverty - 79 million - as there were at the beginning of the century .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has taken an active role in monitoring the waste management situation in Campania , as shown , for example , by the report adopted by the Committee on Petitions following the visit to Campania which it carried out in April last year .
Such people very often display antipathy towards others , feel alienated , and have a fear of the censure of society .
I , like many others , have continuing concerns about block data transfer and indeed the control of that data once it leaves our control .
- Report : Paulo Casaca
The way to make progress in this area is to enhance their skills , for example , by channelling EU funds more effectively towards policies for young people .
To be honest , I find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the Euratom regulations alone , but that we also have to consider consumer protection , protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants , based on the rules of the European Treaty , so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome .
Finally , it binds European energy security into close cooperation with NATO .
We think that the European Union and the European Commission should be much more exacting with regard to the values that can lead us towards a project for shared peace and security .
In any case , she can count on my commitment .
By November of this year , all Member States should put into place criminal penalties for racist and xenophobic crimes , as laid down in the framework decision .
I would also like to urge Serbia to make a firmer commitment to employment policies and social cohesion .
The financing of land ownership in developing countries needs to be looked at as an investment cost under the EIB external lending mandate .
The European Union can play an important role in this context , as it is not only its right but also its duty to insist on full compliance with high environmental standards , as I can well imagine that similar hazardous reservoirs exist in other Member States .
Given that I was also the rapporteur for the only report by a European institution on the subject of earthquakes , I know full well that a great deal can and must be done at European level .
This brings me to the Commission as a whole .
Institutional cooperation must be fair , logical and democratic .
I believe that it was the right decision to do so , to wait in July , not to appoint and to wait for the proposals that we are going to debate now .
Mr Mavrommatis made a number of points which we have noted but I think 70 years is the best proxy for life .
Under EU legislation , passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline .
( LT ) The report on the amendment of the Council regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community is being presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Although the wording of Articles 7 and 8 has been improved , I believe that more could have been done towards ensuring greater equity .
The EU must not stand idly by ; the EU must do more to protect women and children , as well as the principle of the rule of law for everyone , in Egypt and in Libya .
I am happy to report the first steps taken as a consequence .
Colleagues , this is a plenary sitting , so please stop talking and give us the opportunity to carry on with our one-minute speeches .
However , it must not be left to take those decisions which are the responsibility of all Member States in the euro area .
We insist that assisting spouses be compulsorily insured , as is the case for the self-employed .
Moreover , given that the government had lost access to financial markets , no support would have meant that fiscal policy would have been even more restrictive than has been the case under the programme , and expenditure restraint would have been more severe .
I offer , as an example of such dogmas , the recent article by V√°clav Klaus advising us how to overcome this financial crisis by temporarily softening social , environmental and health standards because , he says , these standards obstruct rational human behaviour .
As part of the ongoing discussions , it is important to establish clear guidelines and to defend them , including on behalf of Austria .
Consumers and professionals will have to strip unwanted paint using one of the many equally effective but non-harmful alternative chemicals or , for instance , by pyrolitic / thermal stripping .
This time , after a lengthy debate , Ireland , a small country just like Finland , sought protection in the European Union , and it wants to help strengthen the EU .
From the perspective of budgetary control , which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions , the EIB has definitely earned its high rating , in particular with regard to political reliability .
It is an onerous task , but I am certain that you will make every effort to accomplish it .
I am not the only one who would like to be enlightened on this matter .
We have followed also with deep concern reports of the detention of several Tibetan students and teachers who peacefully demonstrated in protest against the government &apos;s education reform plan .
Given the positions of the main protagonists in this process , we will all have to show some level of flexibility .
There are , however , additional important factors which could contribute to patients having easier access to cross-border healthcare services in the future .
He in turn will be expected to swear in a Vice-President from the north of the country , which opens new speculations on the political scene in Nigeria .
Another important aspect is also the development of alternative sources of funding .
It was a real joy for me to work on this report , and I hope that it will be followed up in separate reports for the individual western Balkan countries .
I therefore support the resolution , which calls on the Commission to include bee diseases within the scope of European veterinary policy and to draw up an action plan to tackle bee mortality .
The beneficiaries , however , are the people who will be getting a free gift .
What will be left when these five years are up ?
I am sorry but your speaking time is 30 seconds , and the question is about human rights in Cuba .
Despite the initial actions of President Yanukovych and the subsequent statements by the Ukrainian authorities about Ukraine &apos;s willingness to join the EU , to adopt European models for good governance , and to respect the human rights and civil liberties of its people , some caution is inevitably needed .
Only by a united EU approach can we tackle the increasing counterfeit products available to the public - available not only through the shop floor , but via distribution services such as the Internet .
That is all .
Simplifying access to the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund , and the Cohesion Fund is an essential part of supporting the Member States most affected by the economic crisis that we are experiencing .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Parliament has many times adopted resolutions condemning cases of breaches of human rights and freedoms in different parts of the world .
As you know , the diplomatic fall-out of the Gaza conflict in the wider region has been very significant : indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended ; Mauritania and Qatar have suspended ties with Israel ; a withdrawal of the Arab Peace Initiative was threatened .
Firstly , we are talking about a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights , which is not a European Union institution but rather a court - one that is part of a concentric circle of the European Union , but is separate - which is committed to the Rule of Law , representative democracy and human rights .
We can help foster markets for new technologies , for example clean and energy-efficient vehicles , and facilitate harmonised standards for broad market introduction of new technologies .

This situation causes serious disturbances both for the carriers and for the EU companies .
Neither should the constant threat under which Israeli children live be allowed .
The new President of the European Council will be fully functioning by 1 January 2010 and has presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future .
We do not as yet have a legislative initiative based on the Treaty of Lisbon , but we have been promised an answer on our expectations from the Commission .
This instrument will facilitate economic , technical , academic , financial and cultural cooperation , thereby yielding benefits for both the European Union and its partners .
Climate change , as I have said many times , is an urgent and serious matter and requires targeted and effective instruments .
The European Union must now move on and concentrate on the real work at hand , in building dynamic and competitive economies and in creating a strong global trading system and , specifically during the course of the weeks ahead , in securing a really effective agreement on climate change .
At that moment , a peaceful United Europe , a European Parliament , must have seemed like a fantasy to anyone alive .
Nevertheless , there are certain aspects of the adopted resolution that are less clear and others that have not been sufficiently developed .
However , I am putting the next College of Commissioners - both President and members - on notice that I and others in this House will pursue this to the very end , because we have got to persuade and cajole our producers to meet high standards .
The main issue , however , lies elsewhere : unless the political nature of the European project is clarified , we will be incapable of dealing with our problems .
I totally agree with linking the debate on territorial cohesion to the debate on the future of the EU &apos;s cohesion policy , given that the reform of the latter must incorporate the conclusions of the former .
If our Member States , mindful of budgetary constraints , can invest less in education , training , research and innovation , let us do so at European level by combining our resources and , therefore , by achieving economies of scale .
Here I ask colleagues to agree to an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution : namely , not only to voice regret at the situation , but also to urge the Azerbaijani Government to cancel its decision and renew FM licences for the radio stations mentioned .
Let me say once again that the political commitment of the Euro Plus Pact comes on top of all the other measures in the package to improve Member States &apos; economic performance : the stronger Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal surveillance , the new macroeconomic surveillance and implementation of the crucial EU 2020 Strategy on structural reforms to achieve economic growth .
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that creating a safe and transparent environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties promotes the quality of European democracy .
Alzheimer &apos;s is an insidious disease for which there are no effective drugs , despite extensive research .
We believe the review conference can succeed only through a balanced approach .
I fully supported the adoption of this report which approves Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area .
That is not our job , and I am appealing to your sense of fairness - something that you normally always demonstrate - and I beg you to remain fair in this case , too .
Before the vote on paragraph 16 :
A similar situation also prevails in Baumgarten , Austria .
If they organise themselves in a proper way , they can really change .
There are two aspects of this worth highlighting .
I voted in favour of the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security , because it tables important proposals on how the common agricultural policy to be put in place after 2013 needs to respond to challenges relating to food security , climate change , the economic crisis and keeping territorial balance within the EU , amongst other things .
Following the amendment to the Staff Regulations and an amendment to the Financial Regulation so that the creation of the European External Action Service is encompassed in those documents , it is now necessary to approve a budget for its proper functioning .

May this prove to be the final relinquishment of German and French plans to standardise taxation in the EU .
Only subject C selling the final goods to the consumer pays VAT .
Lastly , there is the dreadful security situation in the Darfur region and the government &apos;s unilateral wish to organise a referendum on its status on 1 July 2011 .
Such a system takes much greater account of market variances and differences in thinking between individual Member States .
Mrs Rapti , I gave you a little more time because birth always takes a little more time .
Under these circumstances , if , on all sides of this House , we are willing to take action to defend what we call the democratic values of the European Union , then we must issue a solemn warning and , Commissioner , we must enforce European law as you have worded it , and say , together with the thousands of Italian intellectuals , creators and journalists , that the freedom to inform and the freedom to be informed must be respected unconditionally in Italy as in the whole of the European Union .
Thus , they have managed , through this long , drawn-out procedure , either to remove the teeth of every positive provision designed to control safety rules for ships or to postpone them indefinitely .
The Swedish Presidency has faced the economic crisis and financial turmoil with sound , realistic measures .
Lastly , I consider it essential to guarantee the right to resume the same job or be allocated an equivalent working position .

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group firmly and consistently supports the goal of EU accession for all the Western Balkan countries .
But we are putting all the emphasis on Member States and very little on what is behind some market activity .
We will have to combine the leadership of the Environment Council when negotiating and planning climate change policies with greater capacity for external action .

The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country .
The next item is the report by Mr Karim , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement .
I therefore consider the conclusions of the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation - according to which the outermost regions &apos; interests should also be considered - to be a contribution of great relevance , in that Parliament should consent to the agreements if the Commission and Council : present to Parliament , as soon as possible , an impact assessment on the consequences of the agreements for banana-producing developing countries and for the outermost regions ; implement specific measures aimed at strengthening banana producers &apos; commercial position , and adopt measures to finance a programme in favour of banana-producing ACP countries .
The key factor to achieving this goal is for developed countries to want to open their markets to developing countries , which also includes India .
I am very grateful that Mr David and others have succeeded in putting together a package that received the support of a broad majority in committee .
There must be one objective for 2020 : every young person must have a job .
Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical , social and generational terms , increasing climate change ( for which humans are partly to blame ) and the associated increase in natural disasters , increased environmental pollution , imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas , and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet , have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like , at this early stage , to express my thanks to all my fellow Members for the work that we have carried out together on this issue , which has enabled all the political groups in this Parliament to reach a common position and has allowed them to table an oral question and to draw up a resolution to accompany the voluntary partnership agreements .
The European economic recovery plan submitted by the Commission in November 2008 and approved by the Council is concerned with solving urgent questions and also calls for investments which should bring long-term benefits to the Union .

Ukraine must grasp the nettle on both fronts , no matter how difficult it might seem at the moment .
It is extremely important to raise patients &apos; awareness of prescription drugs in order to prevent overconsumption of medicines as a result of commercial considerations .
Ukraine is a European state and shares all of Europe &apos;s cultural values .
For us , therefore , this law is in complete contradiction with European values , as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
Establishing a common legal framework is absolutely necessary in order to facilitate and accelerate the development of these infrastructures .
The President replied to this that these were internal matters and the European Union cannot interfere in internal matters .
The EU should take a stronger position on this case .
A possible deficit in the fund is a matter for the fund and its members , not for the European taxpayer .
The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that this premium is only paid in Denmark , Sweden and Slovenia , where , as we know , bullfighting does not happen .
I will refer here to a statement made by Mrs Doyle .
All of that requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which we are lacking .
In the proposal put out by the Commission 10 days or so ago , it is an optional measure : in other words , instead of building up an aspect of the Single Market , the Commission is tearing one down .
For those two reasons , I think we should be very careful of not so much where the money comes from , but where it goes to .
First and foremost , we must give Vice-President Tajani credit for having given a very strong boost to the new European tourism policy laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon , with the communication adopted last June and the associated implementation plan presented a few weeks ago .
I am also in favour of &apos; more &apos; budgetary aid , whether general or sector-specific , and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow .
Finally , I would like to say that exactly 200 years ago Darwin published his book on the origin of species .
I believe that , with the Swedish Presidency &apos;s persistence , we will achieve success at the Copenhagen Summit .
However , I feel that the measures that have already been taken regarding the identification of sheep are indeed good in general .
Mrs Lulling , I have just been informed that ros√© wine is scheduled to be discussed in May .
( RO ) Madam President , as has also been mentioned by previous speakers , the European Union has obviously not made sufficient progress up to now in terms of ensuring the financial stability of its markets .

I would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009 .
The main objective of the Commission &apos;s competition policy is to enable the companies involved to benefit from a safety zone through the adoption of block exemption regulations designed to guarantee proper supervision of the markets .
Madam President , the Spring Summit is supposed to be the energy summit .
Citizens expect the law to be applied equally to everyone .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that these upgrades to the EU-Egypt free trade agreements can contribute to economic and political stability in this key region , with a view to consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
This report seeks to contribute to a new energy action plan , within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy .
And Mrs ≈¢icƒÉu &apos;s question ?
Europe must commit itself more to achieving the Millennium Development Goals ; in other words , it must devote at least 0.7 % of GDP to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015 .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that both reports focus particularly on the principle of partnership .
It is a patent contradiction to mention the Copenhagen criteria , to mention another type of legislation and , at the same time , - when , perhaps , it is not of interest or when , perhaps , one is not brave enough - to hide behind the lack of jurisdiction in order not to , shall we say , make progress in the protection of minority groups , because we are , ultimately , facing an eternal dilemma .
Many of these irregularities are detected and / or reported belatedly , jeopardising the protection and proper usage of taxpayers &apos; money .
The Swedish EU Presidency and the Commission should be congratulated on their work in activating the Community Civil Protection Mechanism .
I would like to call upon the European Commission to undertake the necessary measures to intensify monitoring , which is an inseparable part of European Union policy for consumer safety protection .
Free Padania !
We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2011 .
Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer , but deal with the processors who always have the option to import .
No one is ever entirely happy , but personally I see the appointment of both Representatives in a positive light , since a balance has been found between everyone &apos;s interests : between small and large countries , between men and women , and between the different political poles .
Mr President , contemporary terrorism is dominated by Islamic terrorism .
Lessons can and must be learned by all concerned in order to avoid such occurrences in the future .
( PL ) Madam President , we all know that diamonds can be a blessing , but they can also be a curse .
Therefore , most attention in this European Parliament resolution is paid to the creation of new jobs and to combating social isolation .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose .
The reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world ; at present there are 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced people , and it is clear that these refugees are a consequence of wars that our countries played a part in starting .
Can I now ask you , Madam President , to write a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency , as well as the incoming Swedish Presidency , to open a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible ?
In the face of this reality , the European voice must make itself heard by requiring us to uphold the Official Development Assistance undertakings made ; by requiring new sources of additional resources to help these countries ; by requiring charges and taxes on emigrants to be lightened ; by requiring that attempts at protectionism should be resisted and support for a Doha Development Round to be held ; by requiring action against tax havens and tax evasion ; and also by working for a debt moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries .
There are those who claim that marking is costly , but many products are already marked , so the additional costs should be minimal .
There are no indications that the restrictions which we are including in the report will in any way influence or restrict Member States in the issue of passports .
I absolutely agree with the rapporteur .
I want to thank the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality , and Parliament as a whole , for all the work that has been done to achieve this success .
Foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but UK diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher , giving competitors a 15 % advantage .
Consequently , the rapporteur &apos;s suggestion to create an EU operational headquarters could serve precisely this objective by complementing the current NATO command structures in the area of joint civil and military operations .
Nevertheless , we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today .
in writing . - The new rules approved by the EP today will give a real boost to consumers &apos; rights across Europe .
The human rights movement positioned itself , from the outset , first and foremost as a movement for overcoming Stalinism in the public , political and cultural life of the country .
At the same time , I would emphasise that we have full accountability , and that it is taxpayers &apos; money .
Only yesterday , we had a meeting with the Commission in Madrid .
If we do this , we will be helping - at least - to extend the Decent Work programme .
I and my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , are deeply concerned about the weakness of the content and the way in which the charter has been drawn up .
The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission .
I volunteered to substitute for Stavros in this very important debate .
One potential and very important source for Central European and Baltic States would be the use of the emission credits accumulated under the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s emissions trading system , thereby profiting from these countries &apos; climate resources .
Thank you .
I supported the rapporteur &apos;s proposals and the approach adopted in the Commission communication &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; , as well as the idea that an annual Single Market Forum is required .
However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council is challenging Parliament &apos;s new joint decision-making power concerning the long-term management plans .
I voted in favour of this report .
Report : Paolo Costa
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that after four years , we still have not seen a proposal from the Commission as to how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport .
This report is the outcome of a compromise because no fewer than 1 625 amendments were tabled on it and it is divided into a series of key points covering the causes of the crisis , ranging from the property bubble to unsecured bank products , the lack of European tax harmonisation and the failure to observe the Stability and Growth Pact .
Despite the difficult situation , these measures will make it possible to maintain a regular cash flow to ensure payments can be made to beneficiaries as these programmes are implemented .
I strongly believe that Member States &apos; tax authorities must cooperate in order to track down tax fraud .
Shahbaz Bhatti , a minister in the Pakistani Government , Salman Taseer , Governor of the Province of Punjab , or Sabir Jamaldini , Coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , have become for us innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law .
I would like to use a language that also reflects what is positive about the European Union , because surprising though it may seem , there are also positive things that have happened recently .
This is an important measure which supports families with children and allows them to reduce the unfair tax burdens to which they are subject .
We must welcome them with enthusiasm , not with petty-mindedness .
in writing . - ( LV ) These days , Europe &apos;s livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue for farmers .
There is double speak here , with EU control overturning principle .
Changes are now being proposed for the Treaty that was once intended to last for a generation , with a simplified process , as demanded by the powers that be in the EU , in order to create a mechanism that they believe to be &apos; fully consistent with &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; policies &apos; .
Self-employment is of great importance for women because it could be of great help in avoiding unemployment or in better reconciling professional and family life .
in writing . - It is extremely important that the EU takes action and becomes a world leader in reducing carbon emissions approaching the Copenhagen Summit .
It is also important to make it possible for women to participate in the postwar reconstruction of their own countries .
This will enable candidates from all IMF member countries to compete on the basis of their merits , taking into account all relevant aspects .
Without this assistance , Ukraine would be unable to further integrate fully into many areas of the economy and implement its further objectives .
Largely as a result of the European Parliament &apos;s efforts , all funds that are sold in the European Union will effectively be subject to similar rules .
in writing . - ( HU ) In half a year , the European Union has moved from a hopeful situation to almost complete disunity .
This should save companies whose products have been certified in one country having to go through the whole certification process in another .
We are convinced that it is extremely important to work with India to bring to a successful conclusion negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement that will allow both parties - the European Union and India - to emerge as winners .
Antibiotic resistance ( debate )
Mrs Takkula &apos;s report raises a significant social problem .
in writing . - Many recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence and this is , in part , borne from proper laws to protect consumers in the marketplace .
I wonder whether Mrs Ashton can confirm this and also carry out an analysis of the situation ?
The Muslim Brotherhood is openly promoting this agenda and is credited with 20 % of the electoral preferences .
Of course , we have the EU 2020 strategy , in which sustainability is a planning goal .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what took place in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and harmful violation of the rights of an EU Member State .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am astonished by the discussion on the part of fellow Members who , on the one hand , speak of simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises , but who , when it comes to taking the very first step for micro-entities - and that is all we are talking about today , not about any other scale - are already inclined to say no again .
I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage this waste , so as to stop it being dangerous , and the adoption of regulators that are more demanding and prevent the violation of this directive .
Our objective should be to switch entirely to renewable energy by 2050 .
We need absolutely proper implementation of existing regulations and I think your comments about navigation , etc. are helpful in this debate .
Elsewhere , it bemoans the fact that Europe has an ageing population .
I think that as a Parliament , it is incumbent on us to strive for more dynamic decisions in reacting to problems which appear in Europe , remembering at the same time to be transparent in our management of funds .
It is also a totally absurd and unacceptable situation if MEPs , behind closed doors , have to ask the Commission about the content of the agreements we are supposed to vote on .
I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions , both in incentivising compensation for victims and in establishing the five-year period for the bringing of actions .
I join the rapporteur in the positive assessment he made of the efforts to consolidate the management of financial and human resources , as well as the improvement in functionality and efficiency of internal control functions achieved in 2008 .
We can usually judge Russia &apos;s sincerity by its degree of commitment to resolving conflicts like this one , but the fact is that in Transnistria , as well as in Georgia and Ukraine , Russia cannot resist interfering .
I am delighted with the adoption of the report drawn up by my fellow Member , Mr J√°uregui , on the signing up of the EU to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
in writing . - Parliament today voted for a change in the legal basis for legislation on radioactive contamination in foodstuffs .
I therefore agree that we must ask Member States to take steps to improve the situation of the children left by their parents in the country of origin and ensure their normal development in terms of education and social life .
The Campania region and , in general , the Italian State are working on the creation of a network of waste disposal installations , in accordance with European law .
Above all it will make the market safer and more competitive .
I call for very strong intervention from the President of Parliament to obtain a response concerning this attack .
In the Europe we dream about , freedom of expression is a fundamental value .
( DE ) Mr President , in all of the countries that are experiencing a crisis , there have been genuine problems .
We would urge the Council to stop making this House a laughing stock , and the Council should also stop making itself a laughing stock .
For this reason , both my group and I support this directive , because it represents an important step on the part of Parliament ; one that will have a beneficial effect on the lives of the people of Europe .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first may I thank the shadow rapporteurs , especially Mr S√°nchez Presedo on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles on behalf of the liberals , who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text being tabled today as a report on the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the extent to which this debate interests the authors of the question can be seen from the fact that not one of them is in the Chamber any more , and so they will not have heard what Inese Vaidere has just said - that Russia &apos;s real visa policy was a weapon it used not to foster the naturalisation process in Latvia , but to achieve quite the opposite .
I nevertheless believe that the work we have done allows us to be optimistic .
In my view , the EU should properly evaluate this option during the forthcoming dialogue brokered by the High Representative .
( DE ) Mr President , the debate reflects the unresolved issues of economic policy in Europe .
Moreover , the Commission &apos;s control strategy for research is designed to provide reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis over the whole period of the Framework Programme .
( The sitting was closed at 23.40 )
What we are seeing is an attempt to manipulate the trade policy of the European Union - which , unfortunately , the UK is bound by for the moment - in order to implement by stealth a largely Socialist agenda that has been consistently rejected .
It is important for us to make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
Broadcast media are among the most important sources of information available to citizens in EU Member States and , as such , are an important factor in shaping people &apos;s values and opinions .
No one on earth could understand that .
If some do not wish to go home , they can ask their gaolers for political asylum .
If this is not our slide to state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of public expression of our gay and lesbian citizens , what is it then ?
It is not only individual entrepreneurs that will benefit , since the European market will also become more competitive compared to other large economies such as the United States , China or Japan .
To exclude , prevent or foresee everything which can happen in aviation is impossible .
There is also improvement in this area .
In so doing , it is following up on the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council , which highlighted the need to reduce the early school-leaving rate in Europe and which also set a collective target for bringing it under 10 % by 2020 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thousands of children a year fall victim to child traffickers and even more are abducted .
Good governance and EU regional policy (
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability for example .
Such cooperation makes the life of a rapporteur a lot easier .
Thus , from a political point of view , it is absolutely crucial that we vote for this text , and this about-turn by Mrs Wallis - and by part of the Chamber , too - is completely unjustifiable , given the debates that we have had .
Moreover , this is endorsed both by the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law and in the 2009 report by Mr Schaldemose adopted by Parliament .
( NL ) I will begin with a word of thanks to Mr Bowis for his very energetic and dedicated efforts on behalf of public health and patient mobility , and I would like to wish him a speedy recovery .
The problems in European aviation over recent days have demonstrated once more the essential role played by passenger and freight transport in the organisation of today &apos;s society .
We have done so , secondly , and above all , because you are using the attention that would normally be paid to the victims in order to create a new suction pump effect where immigration is concerned : social and legal assistance , an automatic residence card , access to the job market , simplified access to family reunification and social welfare .
Moreover , they have revealed their opposition to some policies , such as those that aim to lower taxes , in a message addressed to several governments .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the package on which we will be voting tomorrow would have come to nothing without the will of the European Parliament , and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that has been done .
Unfortunately , however , it no longer provides a reliable basis for policy debate because it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration .
I think that should be a matter for the G20 .
Œ§he next item is the Commission statement on the efficiency of the European agencies linked to employment , working conditions and training .
The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough , with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists , criminals and the greedy .
The European Parliament is today demanding that Dawit Isaak and the other journalists imprisoned in Eritrea be released immediately .
Let me take this opportunity , Madam President and honourable Members , to thank you for the extra EUR 10 million that Parliament approved at the end of 2008 for the European Refugee Fund .
Nowadays , patients increasingly tend to seek health-related information so that they can be actively involved in the decisions concerning their health .
They are disillusioned and alarmed by the possibility that they will be cut out of the job market .
Unless we have paragraph 1 , all of this is pointless - and paragraph 1 , where we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with the ambitious objectives , will be pointless too .
the report by Mr Grech , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on delivering a single market to consumers and citizens ,
Realistic benchmarks have to be set to increase employment , especially youth employability .
I think there is one good thing here : that we are all interested in research and know that it is Europe &apos;s and the Member States &apos; only hope .
I want to say it was wrong that the presidency did not unequivocally condemn the article in the Swedish paper .
Measures are needed to rein in late payment in commercial transactions so as to protect the good health of the European economy , avoiding situations where production structures are financially stifled and there is overcharging on financing products , thus increasing dependence on the banking sector .
It is absurd to encourage the importing of products that do not even satisfy the quality criteria that our farmers have to meet .
To conclude , we have huge challenges before us to ensure unity at the European level , to engage strategically with key external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate action , but there are many lessons to be learned from COP 15 .
It should therefore be based on real problems , ask relevant questions and focus on specific measures that will provide added value to people &apos;s everyday lives .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Opening of the session
I would very much like to thank again the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s amendment which goes some way to protect bees , which are crucial for farmers and food supplies through pollination .
In this way , we can encourage users to opt , in the long term , for cleaner vehicles or modes of transport , to use less congested infrastructure or to travel at different times .
In the area of security , we are troubled by the attitude of Iran and the worsening situation in Afghanistan .
I think it is important to go into the negotiations with the goal that the best solution to the issue is a solution that involves everyone making a joint commitment .
We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level .
On the other hand , other states have decided , for reasons which would seem to reflect their own narrow interests towards the applicants , to exploit the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and to try to keep them out , once again .
I am delighted that an agreement has been reached on this text to allow a freeze on flight slots during the summer season .
As a result , we need to analyse , for example , what happened in Detroit to try to prevent mistakes , but we must not respond with a knee-jerk reaction after every attack because this would probably result in us adopting measures that , in some cases , would simply not make sense .
At the very least , all full-time mothers &apos; work must be credited for contributory pension purposes .
Any further malicious and unfounded political attacks will be redundant .
In this regard , Europe &apos;s approach could be to say &apos; yes , of course we need an external supply , we need security of supply and large , innovative projects like Desertec , but we must also ensure that the people , the companies and enterprises as well as individual households can have greater control over their energy budgets and energy consumption in terms of price , the economy and the environment &apos; .
For these reasons , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposals requesting an impact assessment and will vote in favour of Mr Sturdy &apos;s amendments - which I have signed myself - relating to endocrine disrupters , and those in support of plant protection products being made available in an emergency .
It is outrageous that the same hard-working countries should again and again be required to pay for the mistakes of others .
Europe has been considerably committed in the region for some time : EUR 1 billion per year in Afghanistan , EUR 300 million in Pakistan , the EUPOL mission , which is doing an invaluable job despite its staffing problems , the international observation mission and also , naturally , the commitment of individual States to the ISAF mission .
This is one thing .
Another measure needed is for India to produce and implement some transparent , clear regulations on public procurement , which will also enable European companies to gain access to them .
Thus , with a proper impact assessment and by spelling out the different legal alternatives , along with a clear definition of the objectives and financing for European infrastructure , the long-term strategic projects for building a stronger EU will be easier to achieve .
Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty , which is still pending in the United States Congress .
It is going increasingly mobile , and recent threat analysis suggests that organised crime is getting increasingly involved in criminal activities in cyberspace .
I also believe that , as has already been said , we have made clear where the aspects worthy of criticism lie , namely in group supervision .
I am committed to working in tandem with this President of the European Council because that partnership will make all the difference .
On a positive note , however , the report provides for the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers posted to consular authorities and to international organisations , with responsibility for preventing illegal immigration and facilitating the repatriation of illegal immigrants .
Now , people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom .
Firstly the communication identifies how good governance in the tax area could be improved within the European Union so as to reinforce the argument for other jurisdictions to follow .
I spoke of a stark choice at the beginning of this speech , and the Commission knows which paths it wants to take .
However , it is clear that if the two main parties in the country persist in their stubbornness then this aim will never be achieved .
In my view , your contribution is all the more crucial since the current context is forcing Member States to make difficult choices where I believe it is essential to protect research and innovation as an investment for the future , and I can assure you that I will inform the Council of the content of this debate , and I will remain at your disposal .
We should have the humility to recognise the right of democracy and parliamentary supremacy within the 27 Member States .
I also believe that we must proceed with a policy of zero tolerance in the area of human rights and democratisation and must expect extremely high standards .
( RO ) Mr President , this regulation marks a step forward in terms of gradually achieving the CO2 emission reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe .
We can see that this transport strategy is at the forefront of major strategic developments in Europe .
Groups which are most at risk from unethical practices , such as children , young people and the elderly , should be given special protection .
Despite these reservations , I welcome the micro-credit service in Poland with open arms .
It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to put a stop to torture , investigate all cases of abuse against peaceful protesters , and to bring an end to the trials of civilians before military tribunals .
There are even cases where different national systems coexist in one single country .
The answer is thus to have more democracy and not more far-right politics , hostility towards people and cynical contempt for people .
It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU , with all its different languages and IT systems , when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds .
In October 2010 , the Commission adopted a communication entitled &apos; Towards a Single Market Act &apos; to re-launch the Single Market .
Again , for the sake of legal certainty and predictability , the EU must now devise an effective , transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors , including the smallest ones ( SMEs for example ) .
This EU tax proposal is unconstitutional .
We need a plan B , as has quite rightly been said , and the rail system is the alternative .
I would like to express our gratitude to the European Parliament for the additional amount of EUR 3 million , within the 2008 EU budget , for cultural heritage reconstruction in the war-affected areas in the Western Balkans .
Moreover , the Member States are bound to ensure that no return operations are carried out in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which obliges the Member States to guarantee that a person will not be sent back to his country if he is liable to suffer persecution or serious attack upon his return .
That would enable you to be more effective than if you were to go with an opt-out and allow the various funds to operate separately .
When legislating at EU level , it is absolutely imperative to be aware of the extreme vulnerability which women and children experience in relation to domestic violence .
I hope that , after all 26 elected assemblies have made their decision , administrative people do not hold up the democratic process by withholding their signature .
2010 progress report on Iceland
There are also significant differences in terms of the conviction rate for violence against women in the individual Member States .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
For me , the key issue is raising awareness and I believe these reports will help achieve this .
The next item on the agenda is the vote .
It is important to understand that we are in a period of transition from an intergovernmental approach to a community approach , and I am delighted for Justice and Home Affairs .
We must not forget , however , that efforts for the good of the child come first .
Instead of removing micro-entities from the fourth directive entirely , a diminished requirement for regulation should be clearly determined and established within the framework of the planned revision of the fourth and seventh directives .
When armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure , the situation is extremely serious .
This report contains the following important proposals : improved gathering of information at local and regional level ; better information provided to patients ; increased numbers of nurses specialising in infection control ; encouragement of education and training for healthcare workers ; and greater focus on hospital-acquired infections .
Now Ireland decided to carry out a second referendum .
I welcome the initiative from the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , requesting the European Union for official recognition of the genocide committed by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma population during the Second World War because it marks a step forward in the battle to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe .
( FR ) Mr President , this is not the first time that our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit , who called a president - a prime minister - a dictator in the mould of Hugo Chavez , has failed to respect democracy .
The Tobin tax is one model of a financial transaction tax which has been proposed .
Extreme poverty , discrimination and marginalisation continue to affect large numbers of Roma throughout Europe , so it is high time for improvement .
The obligation on society is to guarantee this freedom of choice and not to discriminate against any activity simply because it does not fall within the usual scope of the formal labour market .
In my 30 years of professional experience in the area of accounting and audit , I have never seen the auditee instruct the auditor on how to do its own work .
It is a good thing that Parliament is paying closer attention to the implementation and transposal of the legislation we pass here .
I am thinking of the abolition of duties on textile products arriving from Pakistan , which would cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs , in Lombardy and across the rest of Europe .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
The radical changes in European rural areas all represent challenges in terms of population , jobs , services and the environment .
It is therefore vital to strengthen and develop concrete and concerted cooperation , and simultaneously adapt it to new challenges in international relations .
From Copenhagen I expect balanced commitments , short- and medium-term commitments , and verifiable commitments , together with financial penalties in the event of non-compliance .
The delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party ( PVV ) has therefore voted against this proposal and wants the costs of all undue losses to be borne by those concerned .
I ask these questions because , while I am happy with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February , I seriously doubt whether we Europeans are really on top of the situation .
They will be told that once upon a time , Europe was divided ; there was a big wall down the middle of it and the people in the East were very poor and they had no democracy , and they lived under an evil system called Communism that killed millions of its own people .
I will remind you that the Polish Parliament approved ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April of this year , but the ratification documents have yet to be signed by the President .
I agree with its assessment of the Commission &apos;s proposal , and I would like to make a few observations on the importance of such activities .
The next item is the joint debate on :
What matters most is that negotiations are opened , and Parliament is ready for this .
We consider possible accusations levelled against them to be baseless , and I can assure you that we will continue to engage with the Iranian authorities in all the ways we can until these issues are resolved in a satisfactory manner - that is , that the persons in question are released .
Jobbik would like to put an end to the economic monopoly of the multinationals and return Europe to the smallholders and family businesses , so that with their help we may eliminate unemployment within the European Community .
in writing . - In line with the recommendation of the Committee on Civil Liberties , I voted against the draft decision .
These challenges are as follows : the first is to move towards a common migration policy ; the second is to greatly improve the organisation of legal migration ; the third is to improve integration procedures ; the fourth is to combat illegal or clandestine immigration with absolute determination ; the fifth is to develop Frontex further ; the sixth is to improve procedures , conventions and agreements with countries of origin and transit ; and the seventh is to make progress with a common asylum policy .
With this Irish &apos; yes &apos; , we know that the Lisbon Treaty will be brought into effect ; we know that , because it was the last hurdle .
Priority is given to employment , since the economic recovery is in danger of taking place without a reduction in unemployment .
The European Union must serve as a model , both for the strengthening of the rules and for efforts in solidarity .
During the period from 14 June to 14 October 2010 , 1 336 redundancies were made , while another 1 498 redundancies were made prior to and after the period in question .
The aim is to finalise this and to report on the outcome of the negotiations during the June Council .
in writing . - The 2008 financial crisis clearly showed the need for European Supervisory Authorities to coordinate the regulation and supervision of the finance sector in the European Union .
For example , we recall the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme , especially those being engaged in with the participation of the Israeli aerospace industry , which manufactured unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009 , causing the deaths of dozens of people .
( LT ) Thank you , Minister , for the efforts you have made , as the country holding the Presidency , to combat poverty .
I share the belief that without a global agreement , all of our efforts will come to nothing .
I would like to highlight one paragraph in the draft Commission statement which is attached to the proposal .
These three reports retain the spirit and the far-sighted stimulus that characterise Professor Mario Monti &apos;s new strategy for the Single Market , and they succeed in representing the unity of purpose of reviving the European Single Market via 50 measures , which are then reproduced and synthesised or emphasised , by this Parliament , in 14 priorities .
Gulf governments are responding in different ways : substantial financial packages to alleviate the most pressing and social needs , announcements for political reforms , ceding some legislative powers to elected bodies , or openness to comprehensive and inclusive national dialogues .
With regard to Mr Ziobro &apos;s argument , there is no problem with the Strasbourg Court interfering in the Union &apos;s competences .
I would put all of these questions back on the table during the negotiations that will deal with the reform of the POSEI programme .
in writing . - I would like to echo the admiration expressed during the debate in respect of the courage of the people of both Tunisia and Egypt in expressing their discontent and disappointment with their respective regimes .
So I simply do not understand why we cannot take on the same kind of agenda from that angle .
The European Union has put in place legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support for those employees affected by the consequences of far-reaching structural changes in patterns of world trade and to help reintegrate them into the labour market .
The wide-ranging nature of the final text and the safeguards it provides for consumers &apos; rights are a tribute to her negotiating skills .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to establish a requirement for the EU Member States to report to the Commission annually on the activities of their ECAs as regards risk calculations and the disclosure of off-balance sheet vehicles , and to make the notification of social and environmental risk calculations mandatory .
Ms Ronzulli , sit down and stop talking please .
It is an important fact , demonstrating Parliament &apos;s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP / CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I am therefore generally supportive of this report , provided that Member States retain a prominent role in the management , designation and protection of wilderness .
Most of all , after what has been a long journey of many months , I take away the desire of this House to see the service come into being , to reflect the needs of the constituents you represent , and to be a service that will serve them well .
That concludes this item .
This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit .
Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity must remain beyond question .
So , as you can see , we are nearly at the same level .
That is why this debate is important , to remind you that this year , in 2009 , the Commission made a commitment to present before this Parliament a communication to evaluate the possible Europe-wide threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information , and to call attention to the importance of drafting a directive guaranteeing pluralism of information in terms of the new technologies and , in particular , in terms of television .
The effective implementation of the directive under consideration and the compensation for the deficiencies noted in the course of transposing and applying the earlier directives would supplement the defence available to European Union citizens against discrimination .
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report , as it stresses the importance of the European political parties as indispensable actors in the political life of the EU , putting forward concrete proposals with a view to creating a safe and transparent regulatory environment for the functioning and funding of European political parties .
Thus , if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week , we need an ambitious budget , and that means not less money , but more money in future .
Yanukovych won the election to become President democratically , albeit by a small margin .
At a time when the impact of the recession and public debt crisis is being strongly felt , we need robust economic governance at EU level .
The joint debate is closed .
The rapporteur considers all the conditions for abolishing border checks with Bulgaria and Romania to have been met , but wants the European Parliament to be kept informed about additional measures to be taken on the Bulgaria-Greece-Turkey border , which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration .
I am pleased to say that the Air Passengers &apos; Rights Regulation has proved vitally important in providing a safety net to ensure that it is not the passengers who bear the brunt of the financial consequences of the disruption and who are not left stranded by the chaos .
As was the case in 2004 , the Council Presidency will be invited to choose a candidate from the main European Parliamentary group , to hold this important position , and it will then fall to our Parliament on 15 July to voice its opinion on this choice , which will constitute one of the first major political actions of the new parliamentary term .
We have to ask all political forces to bring this crisis to an end , because the alternative is the isolation of Albania and the jeopardising of its European perspectives .
I agreed with this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
I also insist that we need to demand the freedom of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , in Cuba and the rest of the world , but I nevertheless advise against taking action that has already proved to be a failure for Cuba &apos;s progression towards democracy and liberalisation , such as the embargo and the blockade .
I wish , for the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka , that an expression which I have heard time and again - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - will finally be consigned to the past .
Public opinion is very sensitive and completely opposed to unnecessary , painful practices .
Secondly , if we are serious about achieving up to a 95 % target by 2050 , then the roadmap requires a cut of at least 30 % by 2020 .
There has been general industry acceptance , particularly among investor groups , of its necessity but , for the three years since MiFID implementation , the market participants have failed to come together to provide a European consolidated tape .
We also need to empower regulators to ensure that those entitlements are properly delivered .
Like Mr Tajani , I , too , would like to warmly and gratefully acknowledge the work carried out by Commissioner Barrot , which was very important , and also the goodwill shown by the French Presidency .
This House has been poorer for her absence , but the Swedish Presidency has certainly gained from it .
Europe must guarantee that we will be much more efficient as regards energy consumption .
Its purpose is to purchase goods and services at the best price / quality ratio .
We Swedish Social Democrats are nonetheless pleased that , in the end , you did listen in part to the demands from us and from Parliament to include more about the rights of women and children in this programme .
It is apparent that different kinds of change are taking place in the Member States .
The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred .
( FR ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s resolution shows that , in this field as in so many others , our institution possesses absolutely no powers of judgment with regard to the dogmas that assail us .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Van Rompuy , ladies and gentlemen , I see two major problems with the proposed amendment to Article 136 , one of them institutional and the other political .
So this is a step in the right direction .
Nevertheless , I do not agree with associating the fight against HIV with a sensitive issue like abortion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in relation to the annual report ( 2007 ) on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy , I would like to emphasise some of the important issues from the viewpoint of the Committee on Budgets .
Finally , the lack of any reference to anti-democratic decisions and the prosecution of citizens , such as the ban on communist parties and other organisations and the imprisonment of communists and other fighters in Member States of the EU in central Europe and the Baltic , is revealing of the nature of the report .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , the European External Action Service is one of the most important decisions in the Treaty of Lisbon .
We must stop free-trade policies , we must stop the free movement of capital , we must encourage food sovereignty , we must declare water and energy global public goods , and we must combat socio-economic inequalities .
firstly , that the future of farming in the Community must be secured even after 2013 ;
For me , this raises the question of whether this means under existing projects that are already being financed from cohesion resources or under new projects .
That is why we must say that we have to stand side by side with these people following President Mubarak &apos;s speech today , following the regime &apos;s releasing of its hounds , and following its clearing of the way for violence .
Today I want to thank Presidents Borrell and P√∂ttering and Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions for supporting Michael &apos;s campaign for justice .
That is why I voted against this report .
For the EU and Portugal I see more gains than losses with this binding objective .
To earn the same as a man would earn on average for a calendar year , a woman on average must work until the end of the following February , a total of 418 days .
For a decade , they have been systematically discriminated against and threatened with assimilation and death , and their identity is in danger .
This report is on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on Consumer Rights .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , could I , too , thank the Commissioner for coming here tonight to further explain the powers she seeks .
It ignored the key question of reorganising the international monetary system .
Human rights have to be her top concern .
As a result , those companies would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities .
( CS ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the common visa policy of the EU now faces a major challenge in the form of the visa requirement imposed by Canada for the past 10 months on citizens of the Czech Republic .
The EMA has a vital role as the preferred source of objective information .
I have received a proposal for a change to today &apos;s vote : following yesterday &apos;s meeting between President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero , it was agreed that a dialogue should be started immediately at the highest institutional level on certain procedural aspects concerning discharge of the Council .
Subject : Mainline railway through the Alps
If we were in the ancient Roman senate , a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to Mr Trichet : &apos; Quousque tandem abutere , Trichete , patientia nostra ? &apos; - how long are you going to try our patience , Mr Trichet ?
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow me , in order to dispel any suspicion that may exist , I should like to propose that a European Parliament committee of inquiry be set up on this matter .
The service concessions were deliberately removed from the directives on procurement in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take account of cultural differences .
I agree with some of the other ideas that were expressed , but in my opinion it is necessary to ensure that Article 4 is concise and intelligible .
I believe that this network could be of great use but at the moment , it is not functioning effectively and is not using its potential to the full .
It is true , of course , that EPAs are different from the Lom√© and Cotonou Conventions that embodied the Union &apos;s relations with the ACP for 30 years , but the unilateral preferences that characterise those conventions became open to challenge in the World Trade Organisation by other developing countries .
However , whilst we fully support the integration of the Roma people within the European Union , we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states , such as access to health care , education , employment and housing .
It is also essential to give priority to food security , to agriculture , to infrastructure , to capacity building , and , in particular , to economic growth and access to technology , as well as to the human and social development of the LDCs .
We cannot go on like this .
The ultimate aim is a better enforcement of EU laws and thus , healthier animals and decent living conditions for the relevant animals .
Which measures will you be taking to encourage the wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis ?
We also need to have best practice because Slovenia , for instance , follows the vehicles through their country .
It is also important that these solutions do not only benefit our citizens today and tomorrow , but also provide for our children &apos;s future .
If we want to avoid closure , then we need to keep the exploitation rate at 30 % .
We have urgent priorities to address in this regard .
Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing productivity gaps generated by the crisis , but also to putting productivity gains on track .
This is a very important issue for all EU citizens , and how the Commission and Parliament deal with it will say a great deal about accountability and transparency .
To sum up , let me emphasise that all the non-standard measures we have adopted during the period of acute financial stress are temporary in nature and were designed with exit considerations in mind .
This report is appalling in what it exposes as regards the conduct of this Parliament .
strict organisation of projects , effective use of resources and clarity about their duration ;
At the moment they cannot do that and so they are , as you say , at risk .
I would also like to say in advance that I support all of Turkey &apos;s efforts and endeavours in the direction of democratisation .
In this Commission proposal , the concept of micro-enterprises is broadened to define them as enterprises which , as at the balance date , do not exceed the limits of two of the following criteria : a balance sheet total of EUR 500 000 , net turnover of EUR 1 000 000 and / or an average number of employees during the financial year of 10 persons .
However , we must fulfil our commitment regarding climate change : everyone acknowledges that we are the world &apos;s leaders on this issue .
rapporteur . - Madam President , you caught me slightly unawares as I had not seen the complete change of the timetable today , but I am very grateful for the chance to address the Chamber about a very important issue of the financial services industry , that is , the insurance and reinsurance industry , what we have done with the Solvency II report and how we have finally brought this now to Parliament in order to be able to establish what I think will be a very concrete basis for regulation across the European Union .
It is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30 % , and I shall conclude by echoing the words of Barack Obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century , as they have already begun to do .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to make four comments .
For that reason , a few other Members and I have also invited an expert who has investigated organ trading and the deliberate killing of people in China for organs to transplant to come and speak to us tomorrow .
President-in-Office of the Council , we wish to thank you for your most constructive , extensive report , and to wish you all the best for your Presidency !
These initiatives , facilitated by EC funds , bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and , as such , offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work .
- ( SK ) Once again we have a problem involving respect for ethnic minority rights in Slovakia and it is the fault of the education minister , a member of the extreme nationalist governing party .
In view of the necessary safeguards such as the possibility for European citizens to lodge an administrative appeal and receive the same treatment as US citizens , and the crackdown on the length of time in which information is stored , cooperation between Europe and the United States is , in this case , a proper tribute to the negative effects of globalisation .
The EIB can , and must , have an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean .
Thus I support the call for an investigation into the margin share in the production and distribution chain .
Yet , if you always put the polluter pays principle first - I am prepared to discuss this with you - then it is the Member States that cause the congestion by not providing sufficient infrastructure .
The first is credits for student mobility .
What is important however , is that we are aware that , although it is particularly intense on the southern borders of Europe , here we have an opportunity to increase the affection and connection that citizens have with what Europe means : added value in terms of the response .
Europe today is running out of steam despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of educated people than more successful countries such as China or India .
That is why we need more and better Europe : a more united and ambitious Europe .
I am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
The Greek Communist Party is opposed to and voted against the amendments to adapt the European Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to make the following observation : it is most surprising that , while growth indicators for Albania are constantly rising , with growth exceeding 2 % in 2010 , in the midst of global economic instability , and expected to reach 3 % in 2011 , social tension is , nonetheless , getting worse rather than better .
Human trafficking is also still a serious problem within the European Union .
Then there are other issues that I would also emphasise , echoing what Mr Paparizov said .
In Southern Sudan , the EU has a significant contribution to make to stabilisation , development and institutional capacity-building .
As you said , the 13th amendment in the Sri Lankan constitution must be implemented , which provides for decentralisation in the sense of regional administration by the people who live there and the EU can provide valuable help here .
Of course , let me repeat , differences of opinion may exist , and there are differences between the Commission and the Council and also among certain Members of this House as regards the regulation of transport by water ; there are those who would prefer separate legislation for river and sea transport .
I support the rationale behind this proposal , namely the need to define a consistent and comprehensive framework for the development of investment in energy infrastructure within the Union that will allow the Commission to monitor the state of development of the investment projects planned in the energy sector .
The beginning was reassuring : in 1995 , a global consensus was reached according to which women and men were equal from all points of view , including political , economic , legal and social .
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the principles of the rule of law and democracy are properly implemented in the country and be vigilant that there is a continuous decline in the level of corruption in Serbia , and that those in office who abuse their position are subject to severe penalties .
In sum , the Europe for which we fight - one of justice and social progress , economic and social cohesion , cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights , and one that promotes peace - stands little chance of being reached with the guidelines that this Commission proposes to follow .
From the aspects of both democracy and legitimacy , it is important to communicate to our citizens what the EU does .
We Germans would not be doing justice to our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to the unity of Europe , following the historical events which I have outlined here .
To put it simply , we have the same person performing the task of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner .
As I have said on a previous occasion in this House , I stand before you as one keen to see a Europe of cooperating nations .
- Report : Elles
In the Committee on Civil liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats abstained from voting .
Moreover , the compulsory nature of the register for all lobbyists who want permanent access to Parliament and to the Commission is an important step in increasing the transparency of relations between those organisations and the European institutions .
However , if we adopt everything during the first reading , Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights .
This is a very important step , which enables more effective enforcement of the fundamental rights of European Union citizens .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the vote will be taken on the Kirilov report in the next few weeks and I welcome this , as the need is urgent .
Personally , I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation because most vans are bought by businesses , both large and small , which are already very conscious of the need for economy and fuel efficiency .
I propose a study on the consolidated accounts .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a general comment and then ask two or three questions , depending on how much time you allow me .
We must also remember that with Turkey in the European Union , we will have countries such as Iraq , Iran and Syria on our borders .
I think that we ultimately need to understand that we cannot talk of economic policy without keeping the employment parameter constantly in mind .
What would we expect from the EU ?
We must not forget that we are accountable to our voters , who are going through difficult times at the moment , for every action we take .
However , for the same reason , they are also potentially a massive distortion of trade , if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules .
I believe that there can only be good governance of the Single Market if there is good quality and up-to-date information on how it functions .
in writing . - ( ET ) In the present era of global economic crisis ( i.e. the economic recession and increasing unemployment ) , there is a reality in the EU labour market that an increasing number of people will be made redundant , which will further increase the total number of people suffering from poverty and alienation in Europe .
Of course , they already had a flag , and they already had an anthem , but they went about building a new state .
These things are covered to a certain extent by corporate social responsibility , but they cannot be implemented without a national framework .
This is a true compromise .
Furthermore , proper operational assistance must be ensured in the event of an accident , providing passengers with the services and items they most need .
The Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can thus declare the budget finally approved .
We need to support the creation of mechanisms of private financing and the adoption of more frequent public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme .
However , we are also aiming to put an end to misleading advertisements on the Internet that encourage people to buy products that not only do not cure , but may even harm patients .
Mr President , I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment , deleting two parts of the amendment , namely the words &apos; by the Colombian army &apos; and &apos; on Colombia &apos; .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe .
Madam President , I think once again this is one of those reports that many people can welcome .
Once again , we must draw attention to the excessive delays between the occurrence of the disaster , the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the actual delivery of EU support to the Member States and regions affected .
We have to have the legal proof and that is why we have asked the French Government to supply us with the dossiers on the individuals .
Europe cannot just be the sum of 27 national interests .
Meanwhile , Mr Reinfeldt is giving the report of the last six months &apos; activity of the European Council .
The downside of austerity measures , which will put hardworking people out of public sector jobs , must be turned into an upside for start-up companies , taking advantage of entrepreneurial spirit by reducing start-up costs for businesses so that they can create the profitable private sector that is required to dig all of our countries out of the holes we now find ourselves in .
The two entities have not been able to develop a shared vision , as a result of which progress has ground to a halt .
Does this free trade agreement ultimately really only suit the world and the division of economic power between Europe and India that we know today , or will this agreement still be suitable in ten or 15 years &apos; time ?
The main aims of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020 .
The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis , but is primarily due to a lack of immediate action that was required when this crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova .
European workers and the poor in Europe must mobilise their power against these disastrous policies and for a genuinely democratic and socialist Europe , and that means opposing the policies of this new EU Commission .
The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
The welfare requirements of animals are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when laying down policies in sectors such as the internal market .
It is expressed primarily at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage , and it is an asset that will be taken into account and emphasised within the context of regional development policy .
I think that is where we should now concentrate our efforts .
You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU .
Indeed , this reserve is an &apos; accounting &apos; method which should be used for any emergency contingencies that may arise during the current financial year .
Let us observe a minute &apos;s silence in memory of our Tunisian friends .
Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock : the euro .
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have just described , I feel that there is now a solid base upon which we can improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research within the framework programme .
We are conducting this debate in much too technocratic a way .
I therefore congratulate Mr Mill√°n Mon on this brilliant report , which comes at such a good time for this strengthening of relations between the two continents .
That is why we have come up with a significant simplification of EU legislation .
Unfortunately , important amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left were rejected and , as a result , initiatives cannot be signed by EU residents who are not nationals of a Member State , thereby precluding equal participation of residents , regardless of nationality , nor is there a guarantee that signatures will tally with signatories &apos; ID numbers .
I call for the setting-up of an independent commission consisting of local and international legal experts who would carry out investigations and prosecutions into the violent events following the flawed elections in December 2007 .
The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan .
This has all gone too far and must be stopped .
The development of a guide for public and private operators and the creation of a training and mobility scheme on how to apply multi-level governance policies in practice could represent effective measures for improving regional policy .
I hope our Spanish and Italian colleagues will come into it , but we cannot leave this waiting any longer , because the whole world is after the innovation market .
Furthermore , I believe we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies , beginning with the next reform of the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , adequately meet those requirements .
Mr President , negotiations which are in progress on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties .
Without prejudice to the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report , I wish here to draw attention to an essential element of this problem .
That method , however , will not expose the economy and jobs to bureaucracy , unfair competition or unforeseen price fluctuations .
This will not have adverse impacts on cod stocks , as there is very little low bycatch of cod at present .
The proposed penalties are proportionate and necessary , and it is hoped that they will discourage the improper commercial practices that have been adopted by commercial operators .
In my view , this criterion is unreasonable and discriminatory given that , as is the case in Portugal , the majority of these families live in shelters in rural areas .
This is a measurement of poverty that is carried out in terms that are absolute and purely financial , and does not take into account the diversity of the 27 Member States ; its line of argument can be summarised as one of simple solvency .
Consequently , both ODA resources and new funding will be required .
The ethical audit concerning the work of this project produced a positive result and this has been certified .
In my opinion , the newly proposed 75 % cofinancing level is too high .
I would like to clarify two things , ladies and gentlemen .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia .
The rapporteur regrets above all that the citizens are unaware of the rights that it would give them .
Whilst creating an area of security , justice and freedom within the European Union is vital for us all , and certainly an example of the European democratic model that we are building , and while many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted , we nevertheless all set great store by the fact that the pooling of resources - particularly human resources but also technical resources to fight organised crime and all kinds of trafficking - should be strictly controlled with a maximum guarantee of legal certainty , since we are striking at the very heart of our power : the rights and freedoms of European citizens .
It is , therefore , crucial to adopt any measures that might strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent , since that will help maximise this instrument &apos;s role as an aid to the decision-making process , and as a guarantee of the quality and suitability of the EU institutions &apos; activities .
My second remark is that the strategy should reinforce the EU &apos;s internal cohesion , in other words its convergence .
This is not , I might add , the direction in which the Commission was heading , since its proposal focused - through the regulation that this House adopted - on the reform of the current system of agencies , which are private , and on the very rigorous consolidation of the transparency requirements to avoid conflicts of interest , of honesty in their credit rating work .
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation .
Even before the crisis that we are facing today , the Member States of the European Union were already being confronted with social problems stemming from weak economic growth , a complicated demographic situation and the difficulties of living in an increasingly globalised world economy .
However , there are motives which arouse a certain concern , linked to the danger of the Moldovans &apos; enthusiasm waning .
We in this Parliament have always taken a strong line in defence of the autonomous rights of the people of Tibet , which does not automatically mean the right to self-determination or independence .
Although a directive will soon see the light of day , I voted with the other Members for a resolution which sets out the direction to be taken by Parliament on this issue .
Against this background , it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and checking medicines , which will provide patients with reliable information .
These are worth fighting for , and that is exactly what I am going to do .
These costs will still admit of some exceptions , provided that the Member State requesting them has a good reason for doing so .
This Framework Decision should not lead to undue bureaucracy in cases where , for the problems addressed , more suitable options are readily available .
The Bank did not see a major crisis coming , and it did not exactly shine in terms of its regulation either , which is far from being perfect .
However , as a serious organisation , the European Union should be better prepared for such situations , and should , in particular , be ready to react efficiently in urgent cases .
- Report : Kaczmarek
We should therefore only support its inclusion in the event that these measures are not effective .
I made a commitment to inform Europe &apos;s institutions about this civil protest .
The EU and the industrialised nations should adopt the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 40 % by 2020 and , in the long term , aim to reduce emissions by 80 % by 2050 , in comparison to 1990 levels .
Report : Maria do C√©u Patr√£o Neves
I would be more specific on two outstanding issues which were raised several times during the debate .
First of all , on behalf of the Council , I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and for the sprit of compromise that allowed us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee to the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers , in particular , as regards disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility .
One of the reasons for this is our fragmented defence equipment market .
Even at the beginning of this period , the subject of energy efficiency and promoting renewable forms of energy was an important point .
The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions , probably including changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , both of which require a Commission proposal and adoption through codecision .
We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to have a proper balance between resources .
in writing . - The situation in the whole of North Africa is indeed dangerous , yet at the same time hopeful .
Coordination requires continuous improvement , and the responsibility of Member States in this area should certainly be increased .
With their very strong vote , the people of Ireland are giving us the spirit and the strength to continue to prosper and to build a strong and , above all , federal Europe .
Whilst the protection of the environment and safeguarding of public health go hand-in-hand , I believe we have to balance the needs of consumers and producers .
It is a conundrum we must solve together .
We need to work together with major consuming countries such as the US , China , Russia and Japan to tackle this problem and to set up a global alert system and register of illegal logging and countries of concern using Interpol , an appropriate UN body utilising the latest satellite technology systems .
Of course , we cannot allow short-term support for the industry to undermine its long-term competitiveness .
I should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
Due to the effects of the current economic and social crisis , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion have attracted the particular attention of the European public and the European institutions .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to say that I feel that this issue is too important for us to continue to live the lie that we have been living in Europe .
We did not , of course , as has been pointed out , know the names of the candidates and we did not have a female candidate , although , in fairness to Commissioner Barnier , he explained that adequately .
We lament the abstention rate in European elections and &apos; No &apos; votes in referendums .
We will have to ask what is happening , and we will let you know , Mr Coelho .
( PL ) Mr President , horizontal agreements cover a very wide range of regulations , and oversights in legislative provisions , whether intended or unintended , can lead to the elimination of competition .
We also need a common European Asylum System that is more efficient and more protective .
That concludes Question Time .
I am also conscious of the fact that you are all keen to be involved in a form of police cooperation that is respectful of human rights and mindful of the European Union &apos;s values .
Picasso depicted this same horror in his Guernica painting of our Guernica razed to the ground by the Junkers of the Condor Legion seven decades ago .
In that sense , speculators also try to speculate on a bad economic situation and sometimes make it worse .
Mr Bov√© is quite right and Mr Fajmon profoundly ...
We must promote not only competitiveness , but also traditional agriculture , small-scale farming , organic farming and local distribution , ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe .
The Rapkay report on amending the Staff Regulations in the context of establishing the European External Action Service , the EEAS , is a very important document on the road to creating a Union foreign policy .
We therefore believe , and we shall debate this again at first reading , that the initial expenditure reflects this priority of ours and we agree with the rapporteur &apos;s emphasis on the question of multilingualism and buildings , issues to which we have always given serious priority , but in terms of the emphasis on legislation .
A few weeks ago , I had the honour of leading a delegation from this Parliament &apos;s Committee on International Trade , which attended the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva .
Bearing this in mind , Europe will be able to move forward with its head held high .
I have asked Member States to come forward with names , including women .
Firstly , it is essential to maintain a geographical division with respect to financial aid from the EU budget for Mediterranean countries and the countries of Eastern Europe , in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 , and also to continue providing support to these countries in the form of European Investment Bank loans .
We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case , and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States .
This is sufficient cause not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit , in response to the appeals of the Belarusian opposition .
It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy , even when it comes to the internal market .
Mr President , I would like to add my support to what colleagues have said on the rights of disabled travellers , what Ms Kadenbach said about children , the issue of fire safety in hotels and , in particular , the issue of sprinkler safety in all EU hotels , and the need to future-proof the new proposal .
I was also going to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission , so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment .
It is clear in the report that the Member States have sole authority for defence and national security , which we feel it is important to emphasise .
Similarly , the Member States most worried about asset stripping and hidden takeovers were ones without lower disclosure thresholds on shareholding and without disclosure of contracts for difference .
I would also like to thank my fellow Member , Mr Lehne , for his approach .
In other words , the Copenhagen Accord contains references to the level of ambition needed to address climate change for the post-2012 climate agreement and it sets the basis for a financial package and invites serious commitments on emissions reductions .
AIDS , malaria and TB still claim some four million lives a year .
More strictly from a trade point of view , I would like to ask the Commissioner for reassurance that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) may not be used to hinder the sale of medicines available at more competitive prices ; safe , generic medicines that do not infringe copyright and whose only crime is that they are produced by emerging countries such as India and Brazil and that they may encroach on western pharmaceutical industries .
After all , Members have a right to have their say .
This is unacceptable .
We want to be involved in this .
That is why we will have to find the right level of financial and technological compensation .
This is also an area where we can take more firm action as part of the policy for protecting competition and consumers .
It is also a disgrace that these politicians are demanding that we accept the outcome of the second referendum when they did not , in fact , accept the outcome of the first one .
As co-author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan , I want to express my thanks to fellow Members who voted in favour of this document , today .
I will conclude , Mr President , Minister , with a suggestion for future generations .
It is absolutely crucial to establish clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) in order to sustainably consolidate the internal market and improve environmental quality in the European Union , as well as to recover strategic raw materials .
The Heads of State or Government also stressed that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union , and that we will also ask our neighbours to take these stress tests .
A very clear distinction needs to be maintained between the remits of military and humanitarian bodies , and a dialogue between military and humanitarian bodies is necessary in order to encourage mutual understanding .
Work is ongoing at the Commission for a more systematic assessment of quality of public finance developments including aspects of performance-based budgeting .
This will be a priority for me as Trade Commissioner .
The Commission could therefore submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation .
The United States have yet to introduce clear , transparent criteria for refusing visas in certain Member States .
It is the issue of financing that remains open .
To others in this House , constructive criticism of Turkey is needed ; we ourselves are critical friends .
Studies have shown that the profits from trafficking in human beings exceed those from drug smuggling and dealing .
Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing , and they need to be told .
No .
This is why I voted in favour of this resolution ; in considering the negative impact of the liberalisation of markets on local economies , it underlines the strategic importance of reasonable tariff protection .
Overall , I am voting in favour of the proposals presented in this report aimed at the recovery of the European economy through greater financial support for projects in the field of energy .
The report on the European Refugee Fund , calling , as it does , for the resettlement of refugees in the EU , is thus all the more incomprehensible .
This is an estimate that may rise .
Economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of housework .
Only when we are fully informed of such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law .
I repeat : absolutely not .
It is also pressing , especially in the lead up to the Copenhagen conference , that the EU and other international actors articulate their policies on international trade , climate change , humanitarian aid and development .
I would like to make reference to a statement by Commissioner Rehn , whom I personally esteem , who said that Nigeria is a very poor country : that is not true , Nigeria is a very rich country but it is afflicted by a corrupt and inept ruling class that has plundered the country &apos;s resources leaving millions of citizens impoverished .
Finally , Mr M√∂lzer , do not be so pessimistic , is what I want to say to you .
I therefore call upon the Council to declare without delay its position on Parliament &apos;s new proposal , so that the ACP countries may benefit from the measures announced for 2010 , and I ask the Commission to ensure that the social and environmental requirements are reciprocally respected by producers and exporters outside the ACP .
This calls for the Commission - as coordinator of the Energy Community - to grab Ukraine by the arm and remind it of its obligations when it comes to Europe &apos;s security of supply .
in writing . - We of course regret the victims of all aggressive and authoritarian regimes , regardless of the atrocities that have been carried out in Europe or for example in the former European colonies .
The main objective of the regulation must be to implement a new common culture of control and responsibility rather than to impose a bureaucratic and costly process for checking each product .
Member of the Commission . - The current EU competition policy towards vertical agreements is very supportive of Internet sales , and I am sure that you are aware of that , Mr President .
On the other hand , the report does contain clear recommendations on the second and third mistakes , and these are all heading in the right direction .
Regarding transport , much more needs to be done in putting strictures on those who produce vehicles to come up with more fuel-efficient vehicles .
The financial situation in some countries in the euro area , which has been under consideration today , clearly shows the risks that are caused by moving away from the agreements in the Stability and Growth Pact .
I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we might best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and , it would seem , necessary , single purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables .
The Commission , and we here in Parliament too , have deliberately chosen not to raise the issue of fund processing at all , because we are working on the assumption that the industry will keep its promise to deal with this matter on its own , without legislative pressure .
This leads me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy .
( EL ) Madam President , as far as manufacturing industry is concerned , I would remind the House that Pakistan is the fourth largest cotton producer in the world , accounting for 9 % of global production , with the European Union following with just under 5.5 % .
In this case , the Council and , above all , this Parliament are also involved in making the decision about the composition of the College and about the portfolios which you will make available and about the programme for the next five years that you will present .
We must understand that things have only been in place for one year and that we should be moving up a gear in 2009 .
Of course , this is reflected in the behaviour of the Portuguese people because the country has already entered into a recession , and living conditions are worsening for the workers and the people , inequality is being exacerbated , and poverty is also on the increase .
These objectives , Commission President and President of the Council , have already been formulated in the 2020 objectives .
We have already been working with many Arab countries on initiatives to get gas , via Turkey , hopefully to a Nabucco pipeline .
Therefore , taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible .
Since this is my last speech to this House , I would like to thank you , all colleagues and staff for their cooperation .
I am aware of the fact that at the present moment significant differences exist between the electoral rules in different Member States .
Many general practitioners are apparently beginning the treatment with anti-dementia drugs too late , in order not to exceed their budgets , and this is counter-productive .
Paradoxically , this tool might easily be misused in practice , and not only by extremists , but also by very strong and powerful interest groups , and I say this because we think a threshold of 1 000 000 statements of support is not a big threshold when compared to the Union &apos;s demographic potential .
The budget for 2010 establishes this systematic approach .
According to the report from the UN Working group , victims of trafficking come from different social backgrounds , from the most well-off to the poorest , from the best-educated to totally illiterate , from an early age to older women .
President-in-Office of the Council . - It is indeed a very important question .
We need more and better European economic governance for national actions to support this line , including the financial transaction tax that I urge the Commission to look at very carefully , including in a European context .
I think the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important because this is not just about healthcare , it is about after-care as well , but we have a period of time in which that detail can be finalised .
First , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports , which raise important issues concerning the contribution of the European Union &apos;s trade policy towards the achievement of some of the fundamental objectives of public policy : respect for human rights , the pursuit of economic welfare and social justice , the achievement of sustainable growth and respect for the environment and particularly the climate system .
Consumers will have recourse to a number of remedies in the event that they purchase a product that does not conform to the contract , and they will be entitled to claim damages if no remedy is provided .
Mr President , the reason for this urgency is the brutal murder of 57 people , who were accompanying a politician on her way to register as a candidate in the elections for the position of provincial governor .
This new smart , symmetrical system will lead to surveillance that is more rigorous , to assessments by the Commission , the European Parliament , the Council and the European Central Bank that are more thorough , and to the drafting of recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans .
The Syrian people deserve long-awaited political reforms , notably in relation to freedom of expression , assembly , political participation and governance .
Many of those were UK citizens trafficked within the UK , not externally sourced , if I might use that expression .
( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Malmstr√∂m , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union returned to growth in the third quarter of 2009 , which could lead us to believe that the worst is behind us .
In this context , Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration , stepping up pension and health care reform , improving labour-market functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system , enhancing product market functioning and the business environment and maintaining banking and financial sector stability .
We believe that it is still essential to refer to the following when establishing agreements between sovereign countries : respect for the sovereignty of the country and its peoples , mutual interest , reciprocity and cooperation , taking into account each country &apos;s particularities ; evaluation of what each may bring to the agreement from the economic , social and cultural points of view .
I think that the transition to a sustainable , green economy will progress even without imposing excessive legislative measures .
Everybody seems to forget about the contribution of the US , and , of course , NATO , in contributing towards peace in Europe .
I think we should reflect on this as an apt opportunity to deal with what Europe desperately needs : economic growth , jobs , a dynamic small enterprise sector , more innovation , more efficient public procurement - those are the things that our citizens will judge us by .
I find that it is not our business to foretell the possible developments in those countries .
The second project involves concessions .
Madam President , during the 2004 European elections , Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace , so we met many irate voters outside restaurants and public houses .
In fact , at a time of profound contrition in state action , the increasing of EU budgets represents an act of confidence in the common project and of reinforcement of action undertaken at supranational level .
I know we have got a good message to say , so let us go out there and spread the word .
This report contains guidelines on how air agreements should be analysed in terms of content and procedures to be adopted .
The language law creates an imbalance .
Perhaps once the Treaty of Lisbon finally enters into force on 1 December , the British domestic policy debate can also be left outside this Chamber .
That is the difference between the reality of the situation and the European Parliament &apos;s pipe dream .
In addition , we support the need for each national parliament to be fully involved , in accordance with their budgetary and control rights , in order to increase the transparency , ownership and accountability of decisions taken , including at European level .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , there are five plus two questions put forward concerning economic governance and Europe 2020 .
This is why I believe that we should actively involve national authorities , the European Commission , as well as members of this Parliament , in promoting SOLVIT .
It is a system that is based on real policies and guidelines and , now , Mr Michel , on protagonists and a liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation : promotion of the agri-industrial model , in line with protection of the interests of the large agri-food industry , and the resulting qualitative impoverishment of the world &apos;s farming industry ; years and years of inadequate investment in farming , of promotion of abandonment of the farming industry , and of liquidation of small and medium-sized farms , a sector that provides subsistence for 70 % of the world &apos;s poor .
Economically : the amount paid to producers is less than their production costs , and the CAP must allow for this problem to be resolved .
Again , I urge the Commission , in their contact with the government , to continually press for the delivery of this promise until it is there on the statute book in the Congo .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I fully understand the significant interest in this Parliament in the actions being undertaken within the Union and beyond to tackle the challenges which some Member States are facing in relation to their public finances .
We sympathise with the will of nations who want a better life , empowerment and a better tomorrow .
You even have the support of the Irish members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and , indeed , must follow up to make the world a freer , fairer and more social place in future .
It was my office that produced the non-paper on sanctions on Syria ; we are in the driving seat .
The day when we successfully get rid of poverty , the spectre of Communism will disappear for good .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the review of the competition horizontal cooperation rules - B7-0565 / 2010 ) .
That is what you fought for together , whether blue or orange .
I believe that this procedure , as well as strengthening the EU public &apos;s food safety , introduces greater clarity for Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU .
In view of that , it seems foolhardy to be pursuing a Mercosur agreement , especially as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef .
Therefore , as agreed with the Council , the following text should be added at the end of Article 1 ( 4 ) of the original regulation , which is Article 1 , point 2 ( b ) , of the amending regulation : &apos; The same reference exchange rates shall be applied to annually revise the value of the charges governed by Articles 4a , 4b and 6a ( 3 ) where these charges are denominated in currencies other than the euro . &apos;
Today , the Irish Government has called for and rightly obtained European solidarity .
Just look at Ireland , a country that was particularly badly affected by the financial crisis : its membership of the monetary union protected it from a crisis of even greater proportions .
He fears German claims over Sudeten properties and , having listened to German politicians on this subject , I think he is absolutely right to be fearful .
an increase in aid from the European Investment Bank , and the European Investment Fund , as well as greater financial support for technical activities related to project development and implementation ;
If we do not implement something which will make countries realise that they there will be harsh consequences if they conduct economically irrational policies , we will not get anywhere .
We have to enhance and promote further activities aimed at climate change treatment .
( Applause from the left )
As always with these complex issues , I have had tremendous cooperation from my own shadow team - Bernadette Vergnaud , Cristian Bu≈üoi and Heide R√ºhle .
In Russia , freedom of the press and of the media is a really major problem .
Similarly , it is up to each Member State to decide to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which are the two major instruments introduced by the Council of Europe .
It is therefore a structured Dialogue which gives us the opportunity to exchange viewpoints regarding matters which are of concern to us .
Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability , with people who are already at work given protection and certain support now to make sure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to go through the cycle of retraining and upskilling in another year or two &apos;s time to get another job ; to maintain the existing jobs that are there .
Madam President , our questions have been framed with the intention of highlighting the benefits our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and what we are able to offer in such a package .
I voted in favour of the report because it also adds some substantial improvements to the European Commission &apos;s text , particularly concerning the data protection of individuals .
In addition , we have carried out a revision for unused funds from 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II could be put in place .
Thank you very much for your proposal and very clear message .
We can also see something of that in there , as well as the attempt to take the holistic approach , which has not succeeded in quite the way we imagined it would , but is nevertheless on the right track .
I would once again like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission , which was sometimes a bit heavyhanded , and the Council , where we tried to find reasonable solutions in night sittings and in many trialogue sittings , because , just an hour ago , they also approved the reasonable compromise we found .
To ensure comprehensive and coordinated actions , the Commission , together with Eurocontrol , established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell , following the Council of Transport Ministers meeting of 4 May 2010 .
At the same time , it is important to remember that it is rarely the problem itself , in this case illegal logging , that creates the conditions for trade in illegal timber .
I actually come from a country , Portugal , and a region , the Azores , where the dairy sector is very important and embedded in regions that are socially rather fragile and where , in fact , it would be vital to maintain the quota system beyond 2015 .
People are not the product of distinctive cultures ; distinctive cultures are the product of distinctive peoples .
In some cases they are , in fact , so good that they should be considered .
( SV ) Mr President , Iceland is a small nation in terms of its population , with around 300 000 inhabitants , but it is a great nation .
Mr President , MEPs have an important role to play in scrutinising decisions on health claims .
For that reason it is a definite &apos; Yes &apos; from us to Nabucco , but just as definite is our decision to support the efforts made by our governments to ensure that diversification of supply guarantees the well-being of our populations .
Political parties can be banned ; there is corruption in the legal system ; there are abuses of human rights ; freedom of speech and association do not exist in the same way that they do in countries like Britain or most other European states .
It is also quite obvious that we need an energy mix comprising various energy sources that is as broadly based as possible , because that will stabilise the energy situation and as a result each nation &apos;s diversity , and Europe &apos;s too , will come into its own .
However , I do have doubts when this Parliament invokes international law in condemning certain distasteful practices , when the legal basis for this is far from clear .
In voting for this motion for a resolution on Tunisia , I am clearly expressing my full support for the Tunisian people and for the historic democratic revolution that they have started .
In addition , it calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies , such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty and to report regularly on their actions to address this concern .
If you push a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decree that , from now on , it may only be amended with a two-thirds majority , you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election .
Generalised tariff preferences ( debate )
Today , we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
The subject of a new feeling of mutual trust presents us with another major problem .
This year , we allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS , but it will be possible to assess the true costs after the first year of operation when a report on all the expenditure related to the work of the EEAS will be presented to the European Parliament .
My question concerns Pakistan , the chronic instability of which is , as we all know , a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan , too .
Of course , we cannot forget the natural biological differences which exist between men and women .
We should also not forget these factors , including when it comes to the idea in the proposal of earmarking the revenue from infrastructure charges .
( HU ) Mr President , what I welcome in this directive is a clearer definition of patients &apos; rights , the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution to the issue of no professionals being available in one &apos;s own country .
Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , if I might just give some comments directly on the issues and questions that have been raised .
Last week in committee I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a ghost presidency .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran , as I am worried by the continual violations of human rights there , particularly with regard to freedom of association , expression and information , and because I support the democratic wishes of the Iranian people .
In particular , fast start funding is going to be very important .
It is one thing to create such a mechanism , but it also has to be accessible and understandable to EU citizens in order to enable them to make full use of it .
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive , it will also make them safer as regulators and enforcement authorities are moving closer to cooperation in all matters of certification , inspections and enforcement , to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
I do not know whether the European Parliament is able to hold a fundamental debate about the European Arrest Warrant ( EAW ) .
Moreover , its private aspect not only enhances the image that Europe presents to the world , but also promotes European citizenship .
Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal we are discussing today is aimed at changing the regulations approved in 2004 , which improved and harmonised the security regulations relating to the protection of EU citizens &apos; passports and travel documents against fraudulent use , at the same time as it introduced elements of biometric identification .
Secondly , some sort of temporary institutional framework must be created for the decision implementation mechanism .
Having said that , on a positive note , some of the agreements we have had in recent times are very good , such as the free trade agreement with Korea .
This is why it is important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again about the social clause which is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade realises that its current approach of constructively working with the European Union is far and away more effective than trying to re-write history all the time .
Funny though it may be , to this very day , the European Commission has found neither the necessary arguments nor the time to influence the Latvian Government to bring to an end discrimination on grounds of language .
I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link any form of aid to the Pakistani Government to the urgent abolition of this pernicious discrimination against the country &apos;s religious minorities .
This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration , organised crime and trafficking in human beings .
That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this .
Clearly , more than any other time , there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach .
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards , and we achieved this in committee .
The main aim of Aid for Trade is to boost the 48 states &apos; domestic and international competitiveness .
Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point , it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion , just as the old &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way .
I have been encouraged by the understanding and support expressed in this plenary debate .
Further , when we look at the point of departure , we have some concerns .
The primary objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States , be they centre right or centre left , is to safeguard the continuing profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union .
Therefore , action should be taken to disseminate good practice and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits that ICTs have to offer .
Mr President , we could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech .
However , there is a very important aspect of this recast , this codification , that relates to all of the restructuring of TEN-T networks over the next decade .
( LT ) Mr President , Parliament &apos;s compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the people of Ukraine , but let us not forget that it is also very significant for the people of the European Union , because Ukraine is an important partner of ours , especially in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy with Eastern Europe .
This is why the Commission must have a powerful voice .
We cannot interfere in a matter in which the United States &apos; Government has sole competence .
The people who manage our woodlands are paid little or nothing for providing these hidden functions which many people take for granted .
Unfortunately , it must also be said that the list of unsolved problems is getting longer rather than shorter .
With regard to Mr Salafranca &apos;s valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America , I would like to request that the Council and the Commission , who are both now represented in the person of Baroness Ashton , take urgent action on three issues .
There are large dealers , who have a strong presence in the market in some of the Member States , and there are also many small dealers who are happier with what we are currently proposing than with what has been in place since 2002 , because they have seen that certain aspects , not intended by the legislator in 2002 , have not been in their interest , but rather have made it difficult for them to withstand competition from the major dealers .
It must construct the &apos; EU regional political partnership for peace , security and development in the Horn of Africa &apos; which the Committee on Development launched when it adopted its report in April 2007 .
During those years , particularly after the historic enlargement of 2004 , the context and the ambitions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) changed greatly .
Spain is picking up the baton of the Presidency of the European Union , just as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force .
In this respect , it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act .
I should like to emphatically endorse Mr Swoboda &apos;s proposal .
The Commission &apos;s draft was amended in line with the report that is currently being voted on , following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading .
These are the people most in need , and they should not be excluded by reason of their location .
All medical assistance , regardless of its distinctive features , falls within the scope of application of the Treaty establishing the European Union .
I would , however , like to alert the House to the fact that a recent study by the European Society of Cardiology has once again demonstrated that there are serious limitations to this methodology as a result of low levels of participation by women in such trials .
The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives , but neither should they prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives .
I call for the recovery of organic waste to be given greater emphasis , particularly in this largely agricultural region , for data to be verified , and for a system for exchanging best practices to be established .
It is a totally incomprehensible law that says that Orthodox priests , bishops and patriarchs must be Turkish citizens .
The most significant point of this position adopted by Parliament is the attention that it draws to the scattering of measures , which may therefore lack cohesion , not only as a body of legislation , but in particular in terms of their implementation .
( RO ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
At least the digital single market topic has made a breakthrough into EU priorities .
This would constitute a significant step forward in the direction of transparency , openness and clarity in the European process .
( DE ) Mr President , I support the proposal by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , as it makes perfect sense to discuss this .
Is this the economic development model that Europe should be proposing to Europeans ?
As a rule , I do not allow speakers to exceed the allotted time , but I think we are all agreed that Mrs Tzavela &apos;s statement was particularly important for us .
We want a proper strategy based on new technologies , innovation and investment , one which , once it has been implemented , will ultimately improve the quality of life for all European citizens in the Danube region .
This is a great achievement indeed , given that , without going into considerations of the legal base , this directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and opens up a new range of possibilities for them to access better treatment .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us satisfaction that the EU budget has been legally and regularly spent , and I was really concerned at the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money when I was the chief accountant of the European Commission back in 2002 .
For me it is both an enormous challenge and a great honour .
If we are honest , we must recognise our historical responsibility for climate change and that our emissions per capita are still many times greater than those of China or India , for example .
I am certain that the dialogue which ensues will be constructive .
We therefore regret that , as with Europol , haste has overridden the desire to safeguard fundamental freedoms .
I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal aiming to introduce an additional , simpler method of using European Social Fund reserves to ensure that it can react more quickly and effectively to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing .
Quite honestly , I should have voted against the proposed make-up of the Commission , but alongside the weak candidates there were also several very good ones - including the Polish candidate , Janusz Lewandowski .
President of the Commission . - You are very kind , Mr Kirkhope , but apart from Britain , there are , in fact , also 26 other Member States in the European Union , so you will understand that while we are very receptive to the concerns you have expressed , I also have to listen to other legitimate concerns .
I think we have to be careful there to keep the neutrality of the EU humanitarian response , even if it is sometimes difficult in crisis areas .
Furthermore , it adds new points to what Parliament has already said in the past , such as asking the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations by all parties and report back to Parliament , recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States require full monitoring of the investigations and shows concern about pressure put on NGOs involved in the drawing up of the Goldstone report and in the follow-up investigations , including reference to the restrictive measures imposed on their activities .
I also hope that this decision will help save disappearing fish species .
I hope you will take my questions not as provocation but as an aid to reflection .
I am always willing - and hopefully able - to come back to explain our results , but we have to verify what we find .
This outcome will strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating position in international trade talks , especially in the ongoing Doha negotiations of the World Trade Organisation .
When Europe speaks with one voice , the United States of America will also then adopt this same objective .
This is why I personally support the prices set for European tobacco growers , at least for as long as people go on smoking in Europe .
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States , it is quite clear that some countries take the problem more seriously than others .
Therefore , I would like to see an independent European Social Fund ( ESF ) which is separate from the European structural policy .
The number of new infections continues to outstrip the expansion of treatment , and two thirds of the people in need of treatment in 2009 were still not receiving it , which means that 10 million people in need did not have access to the necessary effective treatment .
In fact , when the dignity of the human person is valued , we do not view minorities in a negative way at all .
I welcome the Commission proposals to simplify that fund .
All the institutions of the EU should , in the future , make sure our budgets are aimed at helping individuals and businesses come through difficult economic times and to plan for the recovery .
The fastest way to make them whole , much more effectively and practically than all of the top-down measures , is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions .
To anyone who today is still fighting this treaty in the erroneous belief that it is a treaty that strengthens the European Union , I would say : those who fight this treaty are , in actual fact , strengthening our so-called partners or , if you like , our opponents .
The European Union &apos;s embrace of global capitalism is an embrace that will smother us all .
We will have a TEN-T meeting soon where the Commission will push ahead for the development of a network of other modes of transport .
You will remember it was a fierce battle because it went up to the Court of Justice , and the Commission - and I have to pay homage to the Commission - was lucid , more lucid at the time than the Council , and we were fully supporting the Commission .
The first person to ask for the floor this morning was Mr Madlener .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
( DE ) Mr President , the line being taken by the governments of the core Member States of the EU , the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified .
Indeed , I should like to remind the House that , according to recent censuses , there are still more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union - the figure has most probably reached 25 million by now - which means that attracting even more asylum seekers is , in fact , a kind of collective suicide .
The Commission must impose the sanctions , not the finance ministers .
Sri Lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support .
We fully support the objective of the Vaccine Initiative but could not support the citation which refers back to another Parliament vote which supports , inter alia , abortion and runs counter to a previous explanation of vote which we put on the record of Parliament .
This document is the result of a compromise following lengthy negotiations which enhances the implementation of passenger rights without imposing an additional burden on carriers .
It is indeed high time for the &apos; E &apos; in the EMU to be infused with life through the creation of a real and effective economic union as the final step in European economic policy integration .
I have taken a particular interest in the issue of children &apos;s rights in the context of foreign relations .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has , for ten years now , been trying to arm itself with legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration .
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for bringing down the national administrative and technical barriers that prevent the marketing of construction products within the European Union and for continuing to build a single market in this sector .
I believe that , if we truly want to abide by the goals we have set for our foreign policy in the Treaties , we still have a long way to go before we can send migrants staying illegally in the EU back to Libya .
