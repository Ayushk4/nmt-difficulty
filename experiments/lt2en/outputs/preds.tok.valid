Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London is a very important event in finding a global solution to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report under discussion in the European Parliament on Wednesday reveal to us that agricultural imports from third countries have a far greater negative impact on the environment than domestic production , which is subject to stricter regulations on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions , making it more conducive to climate change .
It is really hard to realise that the countries to which these funds are provided cannot be used .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime authorities in the Member States must work more closely to harmonise training programmes and offer opportunities for traineeships and exchanges with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
We note that we demand more and more of farmers .
Frontex must be supported , and the EU must also force the authorities to fulfil their responsibilities .
I would also like to add one thing that no one , except Commissioner Almunia , has mentioned so far .
Climate change is fundamentally the following areas : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry , biodiversity and last but not least , the health of the population .
I would also like to express my personal sadness and the Commission &apos;s distress at the nine Turkish soldiers and Canadian soldiers who died during the terrorist attacks last week .
Mr Piebalgs , congratulations on everything you are doing .
However , I compliment the fact that the members of the Committee on Culture and Education are resisting and expressing concern about the downward policies on education and training , especially at a time when unemployment is rising and is causing problems in many Member States in the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported , and have initially increased the planned appropriations ( for example , Article 1502 of the lifelong learning programmes ) .
The authorities then went to a minority government with totally different political convictions , but no one has called a &apos; surplus &apos; .
The international community has , in fact , been very irresponsible in doing nothing when Abyei was not dealt with in a referendum because of the premise for the future .
The case of Marano Cozma , a Romanian armed player , where he was brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows us once again that there are no borders for crime and that disregard for the problems of this community is counterproductive .
You must have a sound EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should represent a new European political model , both in terms of the need to mobilise the Member States &apos; resources in order to achieve optimal results and work on joint strategic plans and operations , which will also make Europe into a political union dreamed by its founding fathers many years ago .
That is what our request is .
As Hungary has done from the outset , we support the Single Market .
Inevitably , climate change makes the public and the European economy adapt to the new reality .
The individual states will continue to promote internal security and help to find solutions to the social , economic and national tensions .
It was a wonderful three-year romanman and , like most short-term romantics , it has come to an end .
At the moment , it is very important for NATO not to lose its vigilance and support , especially in Afghanistan .
However , something will have to happen and we will have to make things move .
In this respect , common management will be needed , such as reduced VAT rates , exemptions from the system , the possibility of a maximum rate of tariffs and , ultimately , a place of taxation where internal trade takes place within the EU .
Let me tell you a few things about Western Midlands : we have the highest youth unemployment rate and our car industry destroyed , not least because the European Union finances jobs in Slovakia , which has taken up important jobs from the Raiton plant .
It is very important to ensure that these new institutions are not forced to weaken or contravene the basic rules in the context of reform of the financial sector .
That is enough .
We should also promote the creation of a network of inquiry centres in order to facilitate access to specialised infrastructure and the exchange of information and data that is useful .
Qimonda is in line with the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of setting up a European Asylum Support Office , because the situation in third countries , especially in Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating all the time .
Mr Severin has highlighted very well the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs a strong United States and the US needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this flow of refugees will mean in terms of the relationship that the resettlement programme could have .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will do their utmost to waive these visas .
At the end of the day , after all , the contamination of the products was not imposed by food inspectors or by the EU Food Safety Agency , but by the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
The vision of military capabilities should therefore be used to highlight the so-called &apos; software power and prevention &apos; before operating under the new agenda , which has already existed , but it has become clear only in Munich , so that President Obama &apos;s policy allows us to enter the new round of negotiations on disarmament .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to be able to present this evening a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been produced in the Committee on Budgets for some time now .
In September , the members of the MoDem party voted against the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , because his professional achievements were not the one he had to offer for a second term .
In the context of reforming our agricultural policy , we can ensure that the main focus is on animal welfare : that animals are kept to be kept to their species under appropriate conditions , that they are strong and firm and that the principle of prevention is better than cure .
Now we are feared that , if the scope of this directive is extended , they will expect exactly the same fate as the latest attempt to introduce &apos; Made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , that the Council will again stop it .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to support the proposal made by my fellow Members that politicians , Member States and the European Union focus their efforts on small and medium-sized enterprises in the area of economic recovery .
Countries such as the United Kingdom and the US , both of which have a deficit of more than 10 % , will have to make significant adjustments to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We should distinguish between these issues , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to speak about the new media law in Hungary , and I do not believe that this is his responsibility .
Obviously , there is also no freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
It would also be an insult to wine growers seeking quality , especially in Provans , and it is unacceptable to legalise the product produced by mixing finished products and allowing misleading references to ros√© wine .
Even more must be done , however .
The consequences will be such that people will lose their jobs in Europe &apos;s rural areas and reduce our food production capacity .
We should also remember that , in addition to these institutional matters , the Swedish Presidency - as early as this autumn - has to address many other important issues relating to progress in the field of climate change , the need to address the financial crisis , Europe &apos;s concerns about policies to create jobs , and so on .
However , I would like to point out that we are well aware that the new legal basis will need to be given to the numerous texts necessary for police and judicial cooperation , so Parliament will be able to participate in the process of codecision .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the fact that they are an integral element which will , of course , fall within the competence of the Member States .
This is good , it is young people who are the ones who will decide the future of Europe but , on the other hand , we must not forget those who have already made a great contribution to Europe .
In other words , we are creating an economic recovery plan in which we put three and a half billion euros &#91; EUR 3; give energy to an oligarchy of energy , but we do not give to any of the partners in the euro that we will need in order to initiate green energy changes .
Measures to quota and resource management are very important to prevent the total overfishing of resources in inland waters and waters .
We would have preferred Parliament &apos;s resources to have been increased by means of reallocation and efficiency rather than by increasing the entire budget .
Moreover , with this package , we can show that the European institutions are capable of cooperating responsibly , effectively and constructively in such an important area .
I believe that front-loading , as the Commission defends in the proposal for a recast of the directives or , in other words , improving the first-instance procedures , will help us to achieve a real economy in the medium term .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report , which is why we managed to reach agreement at first reading on the regulation on animal by-products .
We do not want to bring European jobs to countries without having the same level of environmental standards as we do here .
All contributions have been useful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
They need to work hard to agree between the 27 Member States to reflect the unity and the will of Europe to overcome the crisis and to preserve the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-Chair of the European Parliament responsible for democracy and human rights , and I want to thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is , of course , one of the sectors with the largest potential for development .
This means only two types of money for projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere , i.e. CCS and wind energy parks in the North Sea .
If it had been proposed to allocate funds from this fund to British workers , we would have voted for the release of funds , and we would be criticised if we did not do so .
As far as court is concerned , we know that the Court works well , but it is still just the beginning .
It is about our neighbours , including Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia , in the immediate neighbourhood .
I and my colleagues in the Commission are very committed to ensuring that the gender dimension is integrated into all the policies that we are going to present .
These projects will help eliminate differences in the interconnection of the European Union &apos;s systems , and will enable the European Union &apos;s own energy sources to be optimised further .
Moreover , this approach is based on policies , and I think that Europe needs more policy than anything , which is definitely one of the responsibilities of our Parliament .
It is also important that FIFA has not been able to put in place second-line technologies , while other sports industries have already done so .
After all , we can organise various courses or working facilities that can actually help to use EU funds for rural development .
Other Members , under the pretext of the absence of this policy , legitimise their bilateral deals with suppliers , who often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
I also welcome the fact that we have succeeded in establishing closer working relations between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legal programming .
Many Member States have made a major effort to fulfil their obligations in relation to the pact .
This is about enabling the European Union to respond to the major challenges facing society , which are linked to all Member States and which cannot be overcome alone ( ageing societies and health , energy , water and food supply , sustainable development , climate change , etc . ) , as well as the extension of knowledge so that our businesses can introduce more innovation and increase their competitiveness .
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow , I believe that there are certain contradictions in this budget , and I would like to emphasise two of them that I consider most important .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will also address issues of global economic governance , particularly with regard to financial regulation , and we will discuss the outcome of the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to look at this a little bit more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
The most important is the reluctance of Europeans to accept the consequences of the freedom of establishment , which is inevitable after adoption .
This is a disgraceful and difficult role .
This is at the top of the EU &apos;s list of priorities .
On the other hand , EU support is essential for ensuring the independence of the country .
The Israeli Government continues its colonisation in its rape and all this after the war crimes that were committed at the beginning of this year .
Evaluations and groups of experts &apos; additional visits show that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to fully join the Schengen area .
Closure of the sitting
Portugal still has five boats .
by increasing the budget in these areas and building new military capacity for further armament race ;
I would also like to emphasise that the government of Pakistan , which has committed itself to guaranteeing religious freedom , is playing a leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries in promoting the United Nations &apos; anti-religious defamation &apos; , runs counter to itself .
This afternoon , I emphasise this because I am openly expressing my opinion .
I believe that the Council has reached a good compromise , because it ensures both equal rights and equal treatment .
In this context , the rapid , coordinated intervention of European governments and other institutions is simply a binding , necessary programme to remove old cars from turnover , in exchange for new , financial support , etc .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is appropriate , but it does not correspond greatly to an important situation once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force and the functions and powers currently shared between the two pillars are consolidated .
Mr President , &apos; success or failure &apos; is what the question is .
Such policies are destined to fail if people working in the fishing industry - from fishermen to traders , who sell fish to consumers - do not comply with the rules .
This costly , ineffective debate in Parliament has been massively prepared for the illusions of a accountable democracy and the huge deception of the electorate who sent us here .
I am sorry because it would appear that we need to be united on such an issue .
We are no longer of the opinion that trade liberalisation and the fight against climate change will completely destroy our industries in Europe , to some extent not the most important thing now , because priority must be given to climate change .
The debt burden , painful proof of which we are witnessing , is not only an obstacle to economic growth in our European countries , but also in the United States .
Furthermore , this agreement will help to clarify and analyse the various air services agreements in a simple way , as well as the criteria that we should turn our attention into .
I am voting in favour of the telecoms package , but I will do so with some dissatisfaction because I think that there has been a fundamental level of deception of the basic principle of the liberalisation of telecommunications , even though this directive should have been aimed at such liberalisation .
( PT ) Mr President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
They will have a greater effect and a lower price for taxpayers if we are able to coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is working on a directive that will make it easier for Belarusians to obtain EU visas and on a readmission agreement .
Let me give you a concrete example .
Let us look at the situation in the area of education , for example .
We also do not yet know whether our standards on legal trade in timber will enter into force and act globally - some speakers have already drawn attention to this problem .
The role of the Special committee on the coordination of the financial and economic crisis as an institution analysing and evaluating the measures of the Member States in supporting sustainable and high quality growth is crucial .
in writing . - I voted to amend the rules on vaccination against bluetongue , more effective vaccines could be used , as well as red tape for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report because it makes a request for strong , integrated EU policies .
By abstaining , I want to express my profound disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which has really not lived up to the citizens &apos; hopes .
Late payments often cause difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and strict rules , which is undeniable , but it is wrong to place the full burden on citizens , who are the only way out of this crisis .
In the United States , there has been an early warning system for this purpose .
This is what happened to one of my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy .
Tell things up : Europeans also requested this when we elect this Parliament , and that is what we must give them , five years later , want to see more votes in the polls .
The paragraphs that the competent European Council has decided upon have been discussed and agreed by the European Council itself .
Personal household costs per capita have increased by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At the moment , I think it would be useful to consider effectively how to strengthen existing legislation .
The conclusions of the summit on this matter are very vague .
The proposal therefore proposes unifying texts allowing enforcement or preventive measures to be implemented in order to avoid problems linked to the recognition and translation of documents issued by other Member States , and to provide a model form for meeting claims relating to requirements on the territory of another Member State .
I support the proposals for the 2011 budget as they take into account important policies and individual opinions .
The Commission can help Member States to cooperate in the implementation of financial programmes at European level .
For example , the Council &apos;s decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 provide for the possibility of cooperation between Member States at national level , in the name of prosecuting these crimes , which , fortunately , we all remember the case of General Pin the legislation of some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be perceived , nor should it be an endorsement of a &apos; light EU profiteering &apos; .
We are increasingly buying distance and the Internet has now changed our habits completely , and this is because of the accelerating speed of our lives .
As far as information is concerned , we provide uninterrupted information whenever we get it .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in education for the young generation , and I mean lifelong learning .
We would like to see the death penalty abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that these issues have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily in the recent agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , the victims are thousands , often with small children , without adequate funds .
There are quite different points when it comes to the Commission on the basis of the provisions of the future treaty , and when it comes to Parliament , when it comes to petitions .
Human rights must be respected by all the countries in the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece raised the question of whether we are capable of supporting the stability of the euro area .
We need to take a closer look at our responsibilities .
We understand that , in any case , the UNESCO authorities have made suggestions to the Chinese authorities concerning the development of the heritage and culture of Kashgar &apos;s traditions .
in writing . - MEP Schwab has tabled a report which aims to improve car safety by introducing higher safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown our ability to act and our resilience .
If we talk about Parliament &apos;s position with regard to external institutions , such as human rights organisations , which may be affected , if we do not agree , although I believe that this will not be the case , and if the individual projects cannot be implemented then I believe that Parliament &apos;s position will receive support and understanding .
These Thursday afternoons in the European Parliament are increasingly distant from reality as a result of the significant vacuum and the nature of the issues involved , as well as how these issues are handled .
I think it is not yet clear at all whether Moldova will manage to elect a president , and if it does so , the country will certainly not be able to organise new elections next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began operating on 1 January 1999 in Vienna , the single currency was introduced by the European states at the same time .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , welcome and support the current compromise , because it raises the democratic deficit that many years have been facing , in particular , women who have been helping their men , self-employed businesses , small and medium-sized enterprises and the liberal professions , and whose work has not been recognised for years .
Of course , our political choices are clearly different and sometimes conflicting with each other .
I would call this climate justice because it is about developing and developed countries and the will to make a credible offer in terms of financing mitigation and adaptation measures , and how we are determined to lead it .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this matter .
I would like to remind everyone of State aid for the banks that profit from this aid , but are not committed to complying with the relevant social principles .
I have not only three children , but also grandchildren , who are currently only drinking milk .
We are ready to combine the technical support programmes that will have to be applied alongside the tough , austerity measures that the Greek authorities will have to make .
We await the Commission to prepare it .
As you said , we need to constantly update the statistics , which is why Eurostat is seeking it .
Sometimes I think that we have not yet learned enough from the consequences of our actions if we do not seek European solutions to European problems and try to find a specific response , even though we should act together .
It is also revealed from e-mails that scientists are sceptical about the hypothesis that has been broken up during the peer review process in order to avoid scientific deficiencies in public reading .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this very timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has put the light on this very dark side of society , with which we are still fighting and fighting very strongly .
We are well aware of the kind of people we have , so the institutions concerned must know that these people represent greater risks and should therefore be stricter inspections .
Review of the Hazardous Substances Restriction Directive , our primary aim was to set high standards of security for electricity and electronic devices sold in the European Union .
Preventive work is mainly carried out in schools , as this social group is the most vulnerable in terms of drug addiction .
At the end of the Cold War , the EU was successfully expanding , reunited on the continent and now needs to maintain its achievements and continue to integrate while waiting for better times .
There are many who want their questions to be answered this evening and we would like to do so in the usual way .
However , the Members who have taken part in the resolution of these problems have known that there is no alternative to this , because the problems in the dairy sector have had to be resolved , and fortunately we have almost managed to resolve some of these problems , which have faced some parts of the sector .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need to include provisions relating to motherhood and parenthood , we have chosen to abstain from voting on such references in this report , because we do not agree with any family policy at EU level ; national governments themselves have to address these issues .
Finally , although this is also important , I think that the next negotiations on this subject will address the issue of EUFAM Rafah : how to revive this mission and how it can be extended .
So the Commission is watching the situation and , if necessary , the Commission will take action , but I think that we should not create structures that are not laid down in Community law , and the Commission will certainly comply with Community law .
As we all want to see the real European diplomatic service , which is not just a continuation of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , which we will be discussing today and which we will vote on tomorrow , are very important .
in writing . - Bearing in mind the persistent differences in the employment , salaries and opportunities of men and women to take leading roles , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC to ensure that its provisions are fully and properly transposed .
I abstained from voting on the Framework Decision of the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try and confirm from the Commissioner that progress will be stopped now in the next few weeks if these fugitives are not transferred .
We will soon be discussing this when we discuss changes to the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport policy .
Today , Wednesday 20 October , the European Parliament adopted a report tabled by the Special committee on the financial , economic and social crisis .
There is already talk of increased taxes in the future so that public finances can be maintained without debt .
Today is the time for us to loud our demands for the freedom of Christians and other religious followers to practise their religion .
Throughout the EU , 31.5 % of women work part-time workers ( 30 or less hours a week ) compared to only 8.3 % of men &apos;s workers .
I support the optimism of stocks , both from the Commissioner and from the Minister , and I believe that tyranny is still very high .
At that time , only a few of us could have predicted the scale of the approaching economic crisis .
Parliament is therefore on the right track and proves that it supports consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs R√ºhle and the shadow rapporteurs for this important report .
This policy has become a very important part of the recovery package because it creates added value and promotes modernisation and sustainable economic growth , while demonstrating European solidarity .
It is also regrettable that we still do not know whether and if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force , and we certainly need to make it enter into force without further hesitation .
However , I believe that this situation clearly demonstrates the difficult agricultural situation in my region , if farmers have to stand in the queue winter for many days in order to obtain modest European Union funding .
The Member States of southern Europe have taken them too late .
This should be done on the basis of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
We will express our will in a democratic vote on behalf of our citizens , so tomorrow will be a very important day .
It must be said that it is absolutely essential to provide all people with housing , especially in the modern welfare state .
In my opinion , the priorities that are political mean that they should be carefully investigated , transparent and democratic .
This particular project addresses the start of the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , there has been an atmosphere of fear among some people living in northern Serbia , in Vojevodina , who are mostly Hungarians .
What we are going to vote on today is a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I therefore understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have a result that is feasible and possible on behalf of us .
in writing . - Although we support the parts of the proposal for equal rights of Parliament and the Council to take part in meetings and receive information , the ongoing dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament on cooperation initiatives , on the impact assessment of the legislation and on the &apos; soft law &apos; , rather than applying the directives , we do not agree with the following : the adoption of binding deadlines for the implementation of the directives and strengthening of the rights of the officials .
You all know that without access to radio spectrum broadcasting , the EU &apos;s policy is not possible , and it is also intended to ensure that all market participants have non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum .
This will enable us to have a common and fair framework for the Commission &apos;s work on progress in the areas of equality between men and women , which my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to other ways in which it is important to guarantee and guarantee such equality .
We look forward to making proposals , as some of them have not done so up to now , both on the policy side and on the economy with the &apos; heavy intensity &apos; side .
Dementation , especially Alzheimer &apos;s , is not just a serious medical problem , but is also an extremely important ethical and social problem , which will be increasingly complex due to the ageing of European society .
I would also like to point out that you have been very careful and take care to note that we should not confuse the responsibilities of the various countries , and I certainly do not want to confuse the responsibility of the Member States and the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs who have understood the essence of this question - Mr Sz√°jer , Mr Duff , Mr Frassoni and Mr Dahl .
We have given them our hand and our full support to all the European institutions ; please , Minsk , accept it , because you and the people of Belarus can win .
We must keep a close eye on what is happening because the President has said that , thanks to European businesses , we will save EUR 38 billion a year .
Now that the sentence of Liu Xiaobo has been passed , we see that the police have even banned the party of homosexuals , which clearly shows that China &apos;s dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals are threatened with a political dilemma .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today has been very clear .
We have to acknowledge here that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved , because it is through the parliaments that the majority of the regulations can be properly adapted , and that this process and the proposals for dialogue between the Transatlantic Legislators and the Transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance .
Some have spoken about beating .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am very pleased to see and hear your speech .
I would like to see this in the agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who help their spouses .
Anyone who has visited Gaza following the conflict can testify to the inhumane suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States are strategically the most important relationship in the European Union .
I must say that our aim is to reach the political agreement at the European Council in June .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money .
At the same time , a large number of participants at the Copenhagen conference would suggest that such a large number of common ideas should be successful .
Mr President , I would like to say that I agree with the motion for a resolution because , in my opinion , Martin Schulz has said what is very important : if we want this debate to be debated in Europe , and not just in Italy , there is no point voting on a resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of Information &apos; in Italy .
I have therefore chosen to vote in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament suggests welcoming the Council &apos;s regulation and no longer being delayed , since the new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and ensure equality in the area of social protection for third-country nationals legally residing in the EU .
This is simply astonishing , and I referred to it in the report I drew up during the last parliamentary term .
However , the EU &apos;s policy is perhaps not as strange as the appointment of a completely unqualified Baroness Catherine Ashton , who is a member of the extreme left , Sarah Palin .
One of these achievements is the free trade agreement signed on 6 October with South Korea , which is generally one of the most ambitious commercial agreements signed by the European Union , and which must remain an example of future signing bilateral commercial agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 level because I firmly believe that this is a reduction that is needed and their stand is a weak point of reference for negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I think we have paid too little attention to the development of completely new modes of cars - cars that are found in hydrogen , batteries and fuel elements .
Our roads will then diverge .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for the own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a Thailand partner , the European Union is ready to help the country in this difficult process as far as possible .
Indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs , is of real benefit to local populations and does not harm the European Fisheries Product and Conservative industries , it was important to determine that its impact assessment should be carried out as soon as possible and to allow its suspension if necessary .
This is exactly what the Commission and the Council are now doing in a very commendable way to ensure that the gas supplies are restored as soon as possible ; the threats to turn to the Court are , of course , not very effective .
It is essential that Member States urgently investigate the extreme human rights violations against Roma women , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all the victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) In fact , the question is quite difficult .
I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation with national supervisory authorities , as well as - and this has not been said here - with national parliaments , in particular , with the European committees on matters such as budgetary , budgetary and budgetary control .
I would advise you , now that the European External Action Service is drawing up its own rules on access to information and documents , to do so by a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not view foreign policy as if it were just a few secret diplomatic areas .
All countries are now adjusting their economic policies in order to get out of the disadvantage as soon as possible and achieve , at the very least , low economic growth .
I would also like to tell you about the Japanese people .
In response to Mr Barroso , this is an internal matter for states .
We therefore agree with those who believe that Schengen should not be weakened , but that , on the contrary , it should be maintained and even strengthened .
It is no secret that our sources of European identity come directly from Christian traditions .
While it is in the interests of large companies , it is damaging to public transport and is deteriorating the state of the rail system and safety .
On the other hand , the discussion on Turkey &apos;s future accession to the EU cannot be one-sided .
This risk must be effective and must be tackled quickly , as the tragic events in Japan remind us .
The main objective of the agreement is to provide greater protection for workers against possible risks associated with the medical use of all sharp or overloaded items .
In short , I will perhaps conclude this report this evening , but it is far from my job , nor that of the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and to emphasise that my group has been very careful about approving SIS II from the outset .
The right conditions must be put in place .
In 2009 , 3 098 complaints were registered by the Ombudsman and 3 406 in 2008 , with a 9 % decrease in the number of complaints .
The European Court of Justice also clearly opposed forced retirement due to retirement age in its ruling .
In addition , there are great opportunities for EGNOS and GNSS to be used in the areas of safety , the environment and the smooth functioning of road transport , which can be used to collect taxes .
With regard to the cohesion area , which is nearly one third of the budget , this area remains the only area in which the error rate is higher than 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for the presentation of a report which received a majority of votes .
I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposed way out of the crisis through the green economy - energy , broadband and innovation - is to expand the activities of big business in new sectors , not to protect the environment and meet grassroots needs .
Your statement , therefore , that such important tasks of the Hungarian Presidency may be undermined by national debate or specificities instead of seeking to fulfil them on the basis of the values which unite us .
I agree with the conditional payment of costs based on prior consent , justified and clearly identified cases in which a patient receives hospital cross-border healthcare services at least one night , which require highly specialised and medical equipment or at risk of a patient or all citizens .
Our leadership should be , and must be , at least 30 % in setting more ambitious reduction targets .
The new appeals particularly affect those participants whose efforts to reduce environmental damage are genuine .
The previous visa scandals are , of course , a sign of the attitude some countries have taken in terms of the issuing of visas .
The poor rural population that needs funding is once again left alone .
I know that you will be able to rise to these challenges .
- Mr President of the Czech Republic , I wish to extend a warm welcome to you in the European Parliament .
Viktor Orb√°n has contributed to the political groups in the European Parliament not as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a populist and nationalistic language &apos; fighter &apos; that &apos; protects Hungarians &apos; from attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I welcome the report and congratulate Mr Sz√°jer .
We therefore need the help of Russia to persuade Iran not to build a nuclear bomb .
I totally disagree with the US idea of preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
However , this is just one of the conditions for stability in Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is a very important document which sets out the new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
With this in mind , we are committed to creating conditions under which the fishing sector is genuinely sustainable and can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic region are dead , but there is also no doubt that new technologies and advances will inevitably lead the region to greater exploitation of resources , and one of the key areas is fisheries .
At the beginning of the year of the economic crisis , the unemployment rate among young people reached 20 % and the proportion of young people leaving schools , mostly in rural areas , has risen to 17 % .
Today , environmental labels , images and texts that may be unclear to consumers are extremely common on the markets , as they contain a wide range of information , from woven wood to dangerous substances , to food claims with a neutral carbon footprint and even green cars .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it seeks to identify responsibility for the undeveloped position of Third World countries and not the same countries .
rapporteur . - Madam President , my apologies for wasting all the time to delay the south , but I do so once in 10 years &apos; time , so I hope you will not fall .
It is a delicate piece of work , a job that needs to change the situation to a good state , and it simply does not have sufficient experience .
It was only last year that we agreed to abolish these rules , but although consumers did not notice the large difference , our producers have noticed it and have noticed it so far .
I believe that the proposals put forward in this package are not ambitious enough , as they aim only to make savings and limit citizens &apos; social rights .
We cannot allow the budget for the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) to be cut , as this would mean that agriculture in Europe is probably worthless .
At the same time , early closure of such a large installation , provided for in economic calculations , results in huge direct and indirect costs .
I would therefore like to express my sincere satisfaction with the compromise proposal agreed by the Commission .
The President of the Republic of Latvia , Valdi Zatler , is a great esteem to welcome you on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then all this drama has spread .
When a third country is concluded , a global approach and a philosophy of the European Union &apos;s Member States are being strengthened , following the conclusion of an agreement with which illegal immigration flows can be carried out , and where there is a readmission agreement - this is also an aspiration - an agreement between the European Union and that third country - it is a common immigration pact .
We regret that the report does not make full use of our proposal , but we welcome the fact that it brings to a conclusion that is very close to our conclusions .
Given that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in the context of world trade is one of the responsibilities that President Barroso has assigned to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I would like to take the opportunity that the Commissioner is in the Chamber to ask what he thinks about his cooperation with his colleague responsible for the negotiations under the Doha Round .
The report proposes simplifying financial supervision and control and strengthening technical and scientific assessment by mutual review based on excellence .
From this point of view , this is what needs to be looked at , examined and understood by the proposals that have been made here today .
There is also a need to highlight the legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , financing rules , sometimes intellectual property ) , which may lead to a significant number of key research entities and SMEs being less interested in implementing this programme .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will review Directive 2007 / 52 according to the points that I have just mentioned .
That is why I voted in favour of provisions which emphasise the importance of corporate social responsibility .
We can see that the newly created point , in other words transparency , has been progressing relatively slowly , and therefore , with the entry of the new regulations on access to documents in principle , the possibility of those who carry out infringement proceedings or are asking for infringement proceedings to be opened as to why it has been suspended or launched , is in line with any rules .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that in this Chamber , which unfortunately is always an empty place at this time , we are not discussing for the first time the appalling human rights situation in Burma .
Therefore , the task of society is to act in such a way that women and men can freely choose one of the two logical options that both have the right to exist if they are viewed from a broader perspective than just a working perspective .
It has recently encouraged the use of foodstuffs that have been reduced , and so thousands of livestock farmers , who can no longer sell their produce in a country that produces 50 % of the production they need , remain at a particularly disadvantage .
It is not yet entirely clear how the current situation will bring our portfolio and business development behind us .
In the case of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is important today as ever - and perhaps even more important than ever .
The use of fossil fuels creates a centralised , hierarchical and inflexible energy distribution system .
In this case , I agree with the views expressed by colleagues .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU is in the process of halfway , which is why it is worth evaluating what has been achieved .
I think that when we look at the first railway package , we need to identify and address the problems that the Member States which have obtained opinions from the Commission are justified .
Israel cannot understand that the military divide only serves to kill new suicide bombers and Kassam rockets .
The Burmese authorities have chosen to ignore the protests made by many states and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General Secretary-General , ASEAN and many ASEAN Member States - one of which is Burma itself - against the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and calls for her release .
The vote will take place after the debates .
The rapporteur , Mr Cuta≈ü , has pointed out that EIB operating guarantees in the EU budget amounting to almost EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , which is much even at EU level , and I think that Parliament is quite rightly looking for an explanation of the risks associated with these commitments .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but on behalf of Terrorist Soini and I would like to know in person where information can be found concerning the project that citizens of all the Baltic States need before the gas pipeline starts .
If the Czech Republic were not actively involved , the decision would never have been taken .
I believe that the organisation of an information campaign on this matter is essential .
Indeed , since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to guarantee the inspection of persons from Kosovo &apos;s identity documents .
Action has also been taken in this area and clear and precise rules have been laid down .
Will they want the vision offered by Mr Corbett , the federal United States of Europe , or more liberty , free trade , a European vision supported by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , for the quality of her report presented today .
It is not impunity : impunity is the same situation for many years .
Sometimes a person with so many good qualities is found .
I firmly believe that , in Slovenia , everyone will agree that such stress tests should be carried out immediately in Kr≈°ko .
It is not a good sign that some Member States do not want the employment summit to take place this Thursday .
We have seen that a great deal has been done in order to meet the conditions in the road map , and we urge the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
Against this backdrop , the Moldovan Government is more than a cynical one when Moldova is not even a member of the European Union , as well as agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky ATM .
This will mean that we will kill two birds with one stone because this infrastructure will stimulate the European economy , ensure jobs and reduce their impact in similar crises .
At the meeting of Chanty Mansi≈Ñsk between the EU and Russia , it was agreed that the common aim is to establish a strategic agreement that would provide a comprehensive basis for relations between the EU and Russia in the near future and would contribute to the development of potential for these relations .
Now it is clear that , as far as the Mediterranean region and Libya in particular are concerned , we are still lagging behind : we need to think a little more to realise that perhaps we need to take more decisive steps to understand what has happened and to take concerted action towards the Mediterranean .
Europe &apos;s large funding for building the line is provided that the project is supported by the local population , and the project will finance private Italian investors as well .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , reports were published on the accession process of the Balkan countries .
We have therefore abstained from voting on the proposals made by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on the JH1 in Portugal , even though the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of the current situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed that information be exchanged according to countries so that each international company should pay for its activities in each country .

Secondly , even after the arrest and the correct trial of Ratko Mladiƒá and Had≈æiƒá will not be concluded .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to support the demands made to compensate the companies responsible for the damage they have suffered by farmers who , unaware of their cattle .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the initiative by the EC to use ICT to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and improve the competitiveness of European industry .
We also need to use the same approach in the future in order to solve the problems .
However , as you know , our message is structural reforms ; structural reforms are absolutely necessary to improve the development potential of Europe and the creation of European jobs .
Especially now , at a time of global financial crisis , this partnership may become even more important and offer greater opportunities for commercial , scientific and technological exchanges to help overcome this crisis and become stronger through a stronger position .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
in writing . - The approval of the Treaty of Lisbon and its entry into force have led to an increase in responsibilities and corresponding administrative burdens for Parliament .
During a period of unprecedented crisis that destroys hundreds of thousands of jobs , everything must be done to ensure that the number of unemployed workers or working poor workers in Europe does not reach EUR 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would once again like to draw attention to the important written declaration on corruption that I have proposed , along with the four other Members , and which half of the European Parliament have once again adopted in order to oblige the Council and the Commission to adopt legislation that will actually help combat corruption effectively .
Mr President , President of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group fully supports Parliament &apos;s overseas programme and Parliament &apos;s activities over the next five years .
For the sake of democracy , let them keep those promises !
I believe that this is the sort of dialogue we will be able to help these countries , in particular , by increasing the involvement of civil society .
As a socialist , I believe that the party war in Sri Lanka is not a solution under the current conditions , but that the Tamils nevertheless have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
This is the right time to introduce simpler and less costly measures for SMEs that can create more jobs and help businesses to develop .
In order to combat this phenomenon , it is essential to adopt uniform security measures in the European Union , including through purchasing .
The issue of group claims is always a US example , a country &apos;s experience and extremes .
The immediate entry into force of extradition and legal assistance agreements between the European Union and the US would strengthen cooperation in the area of criminal law and would eliminate the &apos; grey &apos; area , which has enabled extraordinary renditions to be carried out .
I have three proposals and I would like to ask very emphatically for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been appealing several times to see whether sports activities are a service of purely social benefit , or , on the contrary , these activities include economic aspects that mean that they are a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is a top priority in this institution and citizens must be aware of this .
Only time will it show whether this will be a non-essential phenomenon and whether the positive effects of the directive will undoubtedly be greater .
By modernising freight transport logistics and encouraging co-modality in transport , in other words by reconciling the various modes of transport in the single transport system , we have the opportunity to improve the Baltic well-being .
Only the Member States should democratically decide whether or not they want to ratify the current ILO convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly earned was between EUR 123 in Bulgaria and EUR 157 in Romania to EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the final version of the adopted text will not be very bad .
The Copenhagen Summit failed in many respects .
If the law were adopted , we ask international donors , governments and NGOs to put an end to their activities in certain areas .
This hinders the judicial protection of individual rights - an aspect that we must consider again .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
V√°clav Havel told us today that Europe is our homeland .
Therefore , if , in Slovakia , I appeal to a policeman Hungarian , he must answer me in Slovakian , even if his mother tongue is Hungarian , and despite the fact that I do not understand his response .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like once again to look at one aspect that is already mentioned in the area of maintaining the transatlantic cooperation law and justice in relation to SWIFT , which is the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the US .
In 2009 , we witnessed with concern the increasing number of forms of national protection in both the individual EU Member States and the new developing countries .
In the case of SWIFT , the Commission and the Council have not taken transparency seriously enough .
Finally , on the political front , I would like to say that it is very important for us to enter into an alliance with ACP countries within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
We must do something else .
If we can help to connect the abandoned productivity and family that wants children , we will have made a very important contribution .
As this is a very important step towards the success of the EU 2020 strategy , I would like , above all , to talk about how important it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing with each other and to cooperate genuinely with each other in implementing measures without which it is impossible to achieve the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .

Mr President , Mr Vice-President , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions to implement the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Mr President , this vote tomorrow is very similar to the reputation of the European Parliament .
In a context of an unsustainable global economic and financial crisis , the European Union must strengthen its strategic autonomy , uphold its values , protect its interests and protect its citizens ; a common vision must be created for the major challenges and threats ; mobilising capacities and resources to tackle them properly , thus contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
It is a good time for relations between the two sides and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions , and I hope that it will help strengthen the confidence of European citizens in the European project .
I would suggest that you have a better understanding of the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore urge you to be proactive .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on the strengthening of budgetary surveillance and surveillance of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - and

Mrs Ronzull , I am going to tell you this for the last time .
I would like to see exemptions for either a specific timeframe or a clearly defined criterion , or whether the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to make in order to take into account India &apos;s requirements .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning I have certainly heard every accusation against the Italian Prime Minister , and I have not heard that his business creates tens of thousands of jobs .
Whether this is done on time is , of course , an issue that should be dealt with by Parliament itself .
This report therefore demonstrates the importance of the programme &apos;s unknown importance , while also calling for changes to be made to the excessively complicated administrative and financial provisions and greater effectiveness , as small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are still unable to use it , and at the moment their role in producing products and providing services through research results is important ; as well as better coordination between the various stakeholders , as in terms of financing for research and the European objective , which can ultimately help us .
The fact is that the ECB is not independent in the case of the Greek crisis because it has already chosen to support half of the population .
Our industries will not become competitive as a result .
He has called for a general ban on so-called &apos; toxic body scanners &apos; .
Statistics show that 4.3 million people die every year in Europe from cardiovascular diseases and 1.7 million from cancer .
The Germans are the cheapest and most effective tool for protecting public health in order to protect Europeans from infectious diseases , but it is also important that the health measures reach developing countries , so that life expectancy is extended and help combat poverty .
We therefore need to say loud and say that using the new rules adopted by the banks in the euro area to increase their income at the expense of citizens is obviously not sensible .
We absolutely must ensure that , in this economic climate , expenditure is controlled here in the European Parliament .
I therefore believe that greater protection for industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for Europe &apos;s competitiveness .
He has played an important role in all court proceedings in the Supreme State Security Court and in the regular evaluation of the detention conditions in Syria .

At the time , it seemed that each new Member State would adhere to the EU &apos;s fundamental principles and brave discrimination , as well as the multilingualism of languages and the rights of national minorities .
There has been a loss of confidence , not only in the financial area , but also in the social field .
These new measures provide an opportunity to help European citizens and businesses assert their rights , particularly with regard to the recognition of qualifications and the recognition of their social rights and their right to live in the country .
The question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a matter in itself .
In these conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment so that , if necessary , a EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 can be drafted .

As far as the summit is concerned , I agree that this is a very important development .
You would be surprised to learn how much freight vehicles are fuelled by road accidents ; this regulation will lay down rules for cabotage - and here I would remind Mr Grosch of the comment - that will be applied in a unified and unbureaucratic way across the EU , without influencing cooperation between countries under the Treaty 206 .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that the Chinese representatives were invited to come and examine the government documents in exile to make sure that he does not instigate violence .
This is the response of the Arab countries to a problem which is blocking their development and global integration .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day , we hear many unjustified demagoguery statements from both the media and here in the European Parliament from a specialist perspective .
Since human rights are a key aspect of the EU-Pakistan agreement , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must be granted in accordance with how human rights are respected in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive because it is expected to have a positive impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it directly concerns the buildings in which these citizens live and make use of .
Change 9 takes an unacceptable position on the grounds - albeit temporary - of the European Union &apos;s fundamental principles , including four fundamental freedoms .
But we do not accept that it is acceptable for this House to insist on an increase in the budget .
Finally , now is the time to put an end to this unilateral privilege on the part of the United States .
Mr Dalli and the Commission , now that we have this directive , I would be pleased if you paid more attention to the regulation of social security , a system on which everything is based and which makes it clear where things are well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our common aim , and work with the Arctic states and the international community , together with finding the best and most effective ways to preserve the Arctic region for future generations .
I believe that it was a very much needed and that it is a wonderful example of the achievement of this Parliament &apos;s budget , where the funds are used , so that they cannot be used in other areas .
Now let us talk about hypothesis .
To achieve this , we must make every possible effort to limit the energy consumption of farms in all sectors .
In sectors as important as clothing , skin products , furniture , polar products , conditions for consumers to make informed choices about products are the main problem for those companies that have chosen to continue producing in Europe to maintain European knowledge and jobs .
Although violence against women has been dragging on for several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument which encourages the strengthening of relations with third countries and has brought some tangible benefits .
Moreover , it is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only a right but also a duty to express an opinion .
However , with this draft text , we have overcome this obstacle because patients need healthcare .
The Committee on Budgets admits that these proposals are important and necessary .
I believe that every patient has the right to quality health care when services are provided in his own language , close to home and close to his family .
When we speak in this Chamber , we need to use the terms that everyone has recognised , because FYROM , a candidate country , has been accepted as &apos; FYROM &apos; and not as &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be done , and we could achieve better results in this way .
The recent developments in the European economy , and particularly in relation to Greece , have highlighted the urgent and urgent need to strengthen European economic governance .
In order not to say too much , their supporter , Stuart Wheeler , said that membership costs GBP 120 billion per year , that is , GBP 120 billion per year .
It is likely that a dual approach to Belarus - the &apos; Big and stick &apos; principle , as Mr Tannock has called it - will be successful .

Under this regulation , tyre suppliers must use labels and poultry to provide consumers with information about fuel consumption and resistance to movement , wet grip and external rolling noise .
We fully support each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon or not .
I also believe that , in order to achieve more ambitious results , the European Union should , at the last round of the COP 16 negotiations , give its negotiator the main authority to react flexibly to the circumstances that have arisen in the negotiations .
It is therefore important to create a balanced and transparent instrument , since ensuring support for entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for the success of this project .
Another problem is the disastrous impact of extensive environmental urbanisation , especially in coastal areas and in Spain , but also in other areas , such as Madrid .
It is very important for the Special Representative for Central Asia to follow the situation in Kyrgyzstan closely , working closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
These processes should include the necessary surveillance and monitoring following the closure ; recycling , storage and decontamination of waste ; modification of installations in terms of the environment ; and support for replacing the energy capacity of unused plants , with particular emphasis on environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I am convinced of this .
I come from a country where , every time I went to the supermarket , I saw a man travelling with a mote on a mote &apos;s back .
For example , there has been a whole debate on fertile land sales in developing countries and in countries which do not have land to produce , and their purchase is , in itself , a very interesting topic for discussion , and I think it is one where we can achieve a common understanding .
However , the Union &apos;s key objectives will not be achieved unless we establish a Europe-wide energy network .
In Europe , tobacco is coming from 17 of the 27 Member States ; government subsidies are being subsidised in each case .
One in three - English , French or German - will be used for direct legal protection throughout the EU .
This is a very controversial topic in Ireland and it is very useful to those who are calling for a vote against the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency has done everything it can to reach an agreement but , at the end of the day , it has decided that this should be addressed to the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that sometimes we have different opinions .
So this is how this Commission will work .
However , this could have been a one-off event involving the relocation of agencies to the building in which they will be in the long term .
Thanks to the proposed amendments , the less developed Member States , including Romania , will meet the requirements of this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I would like to say that the praise given to the Belgian Presidency by all sides of Parliament is encouraging , and rightly so .
There is hardly any need to emphasise the importance of these two aspects in the current situation .
We should work together to bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion and achieve a positive outcome in 2010 , because this is essential for increasing the economic recovery effort and for combating protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , is , in part , a special day for me , because , 10 years later , a good and loyal service was my last session here in Brussels .
In terms of effectiveness , I also believe that an interesting proposal is that these delegations can fulfil some consular functions , for example , in the issuing of Schengen visas .
Instead of having discussions with others , we seem to have spent a lot of time discussing with one another , and that has resulted in us remaining completely confused .
In my opinion , it is necessary to improve the project proposed by the Commission and should therefore give Parliament more time to make a decision .
Perhaps more action is planned than is now envisaged .
Without the European Union and without its protective shield , all Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation .
As a social democrat , I am delighted that India has made a significant step forward in terms of global primary education , poverty reduction and improved access to clean drinking water .

According to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia had hoped for negotiations and agreements on local traffic across borders between Russia and those neighbouring Member States of the European Union which were interested in concluding such agreements .
This is essential for the future of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself have referred to the lofty gaps in the implementation of our laws in several Member States .
We must treat these people as citizens and respect them .

We must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly recycled , not only to protect the environment and health from damage , but also to reduce loss of raw materials .
I cannot help but recall that Omar al-Bashir is still an international arrest warrant that these state authorities ignore .
Furthermore , this letter endorses the Commission &apos;s desire to send Parliament a detailed account of the first year of the work of this project , and preparatory work on this has already begun .
Mr President , I had hoped that you would respond to these speeches in order .
As far as the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal is essentially logical for the removal and gradual replacement of products with serious human health damage .
The aim of the proposal for a decision is to set out the fishing opportunities offered to European vessels in the context of the current surplus resources , as well as the financial contribution , some of which would be in favour of fishing rights , and secondly in terms of support for the sector .
We , as citizens of the EU , must give the Tunisian unity government any help and also provide any assistance to EU citizens , including the British people , who have stayed in Tunisia since they got holiday there .
Fellow Members , I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because I think it is right and proper to put the island of Taiwan on the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional communication instruments often fail due to commercial interests , or because they belong to the specific political environment and indirectly oblige workers to follow internal censorship .
We will not be able to live together calmly in the European Union as long as this situation continues , and we therefore believe it is very important that the Commission , the European Union &apos;s authorities and all of us should come up with some uniform proposals to put an end to this situation .
This is one , and I will also be watching certain social , environmental and economic criteria because I am committed to ensuring that all legislation is assessed in advance .
I therefore voted in favour of the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are talking about Belarus here in the European Parliament , but words are not enough .

FVO has also found major shortcomings in the traceability system used by Brazil and has identified the transit of the problems that many sent to the European Union , which have not had the necessary certificates .
The representatives of those committees will now take the floor .
So the most important question now is : what should we now strive for on the basis of what has been achieved during the Swedish Presidency ?
Following this crisis , the European Union &apos;s role must be strengthened .
The key message about this proposal is dialogue on both sides , and the opinions expressed need to be addressed and respected .
I urge the Lithuanian authorities to restore the names of the Polish people and towns in a region where the majority of the Polish minority is part of the Polish minority .
Since all these measures are interconnected , necessary and in line with the level of ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve these ambitious results as soon as possible , in line with the citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it provides for a substantial improvement on the current situation .
I therefore voted in favour .
This report aims at greater toleration , bureaucratic control and greater confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I welcome Mr Daul &apos;s remarks .
The resolution adopted today stresses that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operators while respecting their different and specific identity .
As spokesman for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has dealt with the events that have taken place in recent weeks in the Mediterranean region , when many people have moved Europe out of Africa , some of them have failed to do so .
Nonetheless , less than a sad example of this is the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel is also bombing the ghetto in Gaza .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s opinions , but learning from experience is also important .
in writing . - The CAP and global food security issue are very important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
This must be a partnership based on respect , shared commitment and values shared by the European Union in the area of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
The European Union &apos;s GDP and its commercial added value of EUR 35 billion .
Therefore , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is proposing an amendment which calls - and the Commissioner knows full well that we are appealing not only to Europe , but also to the US - for the complete abolition of all forms of export subsidies as soon as possible .
Most of the consultations have highlighted the need to reform the CAP by focusing on the competitiveness of European agriculture , response to climate change , as well as food safety and quality requirements and other environmental protection objectives .
We also believe that negotiations on the agreement between the European Union and Central America must be concluded before the May summit in Madrid .
The next item will be a joint debate on the following considerations :
Of course , it is very important for the European Union to increase specific subsidies for cities , because this is where the greatest economic and financial opportunities lie and because the crisis has hit cities particularly hard .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Court of Auditors will be formally presented next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 40 % , recommended by scientists , and in order to prevent biodiversity loss , we need significant financial resources .
The governments of these countries are being forced to continue to work and to reform and consolidate the stability and prosperity of the Western Balkans through the central arm of the accession process , the pyramid and stick approach .
I will concentrate on the two reports , because they are very important .
In order to achieve legal certainty for all those involved , we must guarantee equal rights across Europe for all defendants , and information on these rights must be provided on a mandatory basis .
Foreign affairs and diplomacy belong to national sovereignty , and we have therefore voted against all of the reports on this issue .
I am referring to the article , based on Mr Weber , on the article .
I am also pleased that this proposal welcomes the constant efforts made by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened today in Greece just a few hours ago will not set a shocking example and , on the contrary , will be a sign of the start of a united effort to construct Europe through solidarity and partnership .
We have been in constant contact with the Tunisian and Egyptian people , with our delegations , which I very much respect for what they have done in the last few weeks , and we have been in constant contact with the government and the services .
In fact , I am convinced that , in the context of the financial crisis , this financial instrument has an even greater role to play in helping businesses to recover more effectively , and in the future it is being used as a pilot project to create a greater fund for energy opportunities .
Those inspections were wrong .
Then we will be able to make a huge contribution from Europe , but a contribution cannot get on without a dust .
I voted in favour of this special report drafted by the European Ombudsman following his recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT , concerning the European Commission &apos;s excessive delays in delivering an answer to the Ombudsman &apos;s office .
The main progress achieved in this directive compared to the existing legislation is that patients will be able to choose the service provider and will be able to obtain information on the quality and safety of the services they will receive .
I would reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund flexibly , to review the regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund and to adapt them to the needs arising from the tragedy .
Following consultations with consumer protection organisations and representatives of entrepreneurs , I understand that we must demand even greater harmonisation of consumer rights across the European Union .
I said that no one who is putting questions to this debate was a bad person .
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case , trade negotiations - and political intervention , using the available parliamentary instruments , such as listening , resolutions and oral questions , to inform us of the progress of these negotiations .
The contribution of citizens to social cohesion or solidarity between generations is not recognised .
A real reform is about the admissibility of petitions .
Today , this issue is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union .
To this end , appropriate financial resources must be provided and this will allow the EU to take advantage of opportunities and to exploit new areas of global competitiveness .
In the case of public authorities in many European countries , payments are generally late , which often forces other companies to go bankrupt .
At the G20 summit , the issue of the elimination of tax havens has also become one of the main objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
Of course , global transactions still provide a lever to ensure the security of investment , but the United States has accumulated a huge debt that will become more and more dubious in its capacity to fulfil its commitments by encouraging the world to finance its own lifestyle .
We must ensure that a free society has the tools and the right instruments to combat and combat those who want to destroy it .
I am betraying a fatal fact : Iceland has not been interested in accession to the European Union while it is a rich country .
This is not a new request , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method to promote sustainable development and to involve all actors in order to guarantee a high level of acceptance in the local community .
However , this is a problem that will transpose the fight against international terrorism into neighbouring countries and regions until the fight continues in Afghanistan .
We must combat fragmentation and I therefore call on Commissioner Andor to keep the regulation of the European Social Fund in the rules as it is and not to share it as it is sometimes proposed in this House .
Of course , it is understandable that we cannot get a compromise in everything we want .
I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surj√°n , Mr Ma≈àka and Mrs Haug , for the constructive approach they have adopted in the budget procedure , which shows that we have succeeded in excellent cooperation .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) The murder of human rights activists in Russia cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders in Russia .
It should be stressed that the negotiations have not been time-limited , opening the door to a more realistic decision as a preferential partnership .
This is therefore the most important problem for America , which Washington has to resolve .
I would also like to say that we need to implement yet another reform , which will make European universities more free and European , open to students and researchers , and create dynamic development for the knowledge society .
The wealth that they are supermarkets can be considered a national reserve and be allocated at a later stage if Member States so wish .
Therefore , I also appeal once again , on 25 May , for his murder , that the International Day against Toys Day Against Toys against Totalitarianism was announced , because many unknown people who , like Witold Pilecki , lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be left behind .
Let me briefly tell you what measures we have taken .
If it were the opinion of the majority of the next European Parliament &apos;s parliamentary term , it would destroy the peace plan drawn up after the wars in the Balkans .
I really hope that these amendments will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want to play a game of numbers and to see EMAS competing with ISO , but because I think that the system is good and can help us meet our sustainability requirements .
( DE ) ( The speaker responded to Mrs Dan Preda , who raised the blue card )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I think it will be a good one .
We must put an end to monetary dumping and its social consequences .
This aspect is crucial to ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
By identifying best practice based on Member States &apos; fundamental requirements , such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we will create the basis for a coherent European policy in this area .
I know that during the public consultations on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , stakeholders in the sheep sector have advocated compulsory origin marking .
Mr Kelly , I know very well that this is a difficult subject .
Even if most countries face certain economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to preventing the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
However , we must acknowledge that this report will lead to a serious debate on the own resources system .
The general adequacy of these instruments has thus been increased .
President of the Commission . - The Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to express its opinion on the audit process .
For example , it is estimated that the level of fraud in France and Spain is &apos; at an alleged low level &apos; .
The Council stopped the expiry of adopted measures in 2003 .
They are interested in decisions and whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to establish a network for exchanging statistical data in Member States and a platform which will help to harmonise research , prevention and treatment into the causes of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also share the view expressed by many Members in this House that the more European solidarity , the better the relationship between Europe and Russia .
Syria has a very long way to go before freedom of expression and association can be achieved .
We still have a long way to go to ensure equal access to the labour market for women .
However , I want to reiterate the need to reassess the proposal in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are well aware that the situation is unbearable for dairy producers .
I supported the report because I wanted to highlight one of the threats it identifies : the lack of reasonable and comprehensive information for consumers about the specific health characteristics , composition and origin of fish species .
After all , in history , there are examples of western interference doing more harm than they have benefited .
Speaking as rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is totally ineffective and will not be able to prevent crime for several reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a very important political event and , contrary to what has just been said here , Hamas has , for the first time , agreed to negotiate with the PLO and the Palestinian Authority .
The parties argue and negotiate how to share the seabed .
The latter sector is very important , particularly in view of the known problems with energy infrastructure , which ...
In other words , this institution was created to protect us from criminals ( indirectly , by offering professional training to police officers ) , and now it is at the heart of the law .
However , Fidel Castro has handed over power to his brother Ra√∫l , neither has he begun to carry out democratic reform nor release political prisoners .
Furthermore , all advertisements which will provide information about the energy consumption or the cost of a product will also include the level of energy efficiency .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know the Washington agreement : you have liked it .
In this way , we could properly respond to the real events that Frontex still faces .
I would like to end by thanking not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive efforts .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this , and I am very grateful that the Czech Presidency is supporting us in our efforts to find a solution in place .
In particular , thanks to Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the private sector &apos;s business structure , his nomination is particularly appropriate for ensuring a balance between EU law and the specific needs of European people .
1 000 people have died up to 17 days in the conflict .
If such measures are taken , then the number of counterfeit medicines will be reduced and will become safer .
We need to realise what Opel teaches : it is not yet too late to start building a coordinated European Union strategy for the car industry .
We have done so because , like you , President Obama and I reject the wrong choice of security or our ideals .
Unfortunately , the Euro Plus Pact proposes that strict wage saving be a permanent one .
Recently , at Manchester airport , these scanners were re-launched and the legal conclusion has now been drawn that the use of these devices could lead to a violation of the child &apos;s safety and protection legislation through the nature of children .
Furthermore , artists do not receive this money directly .
Civil aviation should support the development of the system and the use of EGNOS equipment for manoeuvres .
Common rules and standards for inspection and survey organisations and relevant maritime administrations ( recast ) - common rules and standards for inspecting and survey organisations ( recast ) - in the case of Uosto State control ( recast ) - Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system for maritime transport - liability in the case of maritime carriers ( debate )
I am voting in favour of the report on establishing a new microfinance facility because it will help people at risk of creating or improving micro-enterprises .
It is good that some progress has been made in this area , and this is reflected in Mr Vlas√°k &apos;s report , which I strongly support and believe that , thanks to this report , we will be able to better define the legal framework for the urban issue and identify instruments , for example , the municipalities &apos; operational programmes , which can bring new quality to cohesion policy .
It became clear to me during the trialogue negotiations that the amendments I are proposing on behalf of Parliament are of the utmost importance for the functioning of the energy markets on an equal footing and for the effectiveness of the energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is particularly important to support and encourage self-employed workers .
In short , they do not require a call to Brussels .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , it is clear to us , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and to all in Europe , that energy has become an instrument for foreign policy , a change that is capable of conflict or unifying , and that is the subject today that gives us peace .
I voted in favour of this report because the food programme that we are discussing is an important tool for helping deprived people who , in the current economic crisis , find themselves hard to meet their basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Many industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least one officially supported export credit agency , which represents the world &apos;s largest source of official financial assistance for projects in the private sector .
Therefore , we are not voting in favour of this report .
Our decision has helped to bring this joint government down .
In 2003 , when Conseil fran√ßais was introduced , I was questioned by the then Minister for the Interior , Nicolas Sarkozy , to legalise Islam in the French institutions .
On this point , I have already asked the European Commission to give an opinion and consider the possibility of drawing up specific programmes which would provide equal opportunities for women to participate in scientific activities .
This is a struggle that we will continue to fight to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and the unlimited availability of end users &apos; access to services .
The major European politicians and minds have fully understood that a force which unites Europe is the solution to common economic problems .
The limits on freedom and security do not end with the boundaries of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that from this summer , the Commission will take on a leading role in coordinating the strategy in key areas , such as the promotion of civil education , professional orientation and employment .
The costs will be paid by the state from which patients come .
In particular , I believe that we can start with a more sustainable transport system .
Dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is particularly important for stability in the region .
We can therefore expect every 25 years in the reactors .
I believe that extending the scope of ERDF cofinanced housing requires us to consider other possible instruments relating to eligibility for financing or allocating funds to certain strategic priorities , in the medium or long term .
Today is the time to talk once again about religious rights in both these countries , this time about the religious rights of Christians .
Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing our planet .
Of course , as I was hoping , human rights have been strongly emphasised , and it is important to ensure that this is a clear part of all our dynamic relations , and this includes our work .
I would also like to say that , to date , the European Union has not had the competence to lay down rules in the field of air traffic .
However , Europe is not a pillar or a cure for the economic crisis .
So I can confirm the commitment already made by the Commission to comitology and optional provisions .
I do not think that any kind of genuine words that we have heard here today , even from the Commission , can be replaced by the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya , and that at the moment it is not even able to stop the crisis in cities or the Gaddafi land army .
I am therefore firmly convinced that if the European Parliament approves these two regulations , it will be of great help to EU citizens , as they will have the opportunity to have a much greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I welcome the hope that the European Council will agree on measures to reassure the markets and stability in the euro area , because whether we or not we should all be interested in this .
These problems have proven to be particularly relevant in terms of pre-accession assistance .
This is a great opportunity to be pleased and grateful .
We therefore call on all parties to end the war and end the violence , and we urge the EU to take appropriate action .
Countries outside Europe must deal with the energy challenge .
The Energy Efficiency Measurement rate for buildings must be indicated in sale and leasing publications in the media .
It is necessary to promote an increase in EU investment in the development of structures on both sides of the border , an alternative development impetus , alternative energy types and infrastructure capacity to facilitate access to new energy sources .
A well developed infrastructure is the basis for the effective operation of the internal market , which then results in an increase in demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider the creation of a rapid response instrument for the ENP , which is intended to respond quickly and flexibly to political change in the partner countries , as we have recently seen in our southern neighbourhood .
I believe that the fact that someone here in Parliament supports Serbia and condemns the EULEX mission is simply absurd .
So the problem is that only those Members who can do so in the original language are listening to you .
We have spent a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that the Swedish Presidency has underlined the objectives that our fellow citizens , our constituents , our environment and climate change in particular , the financial crisis , the safeguarding of jobs and the fight against crime because , in order to do a good job , we must be united with those who voted for us .
As some Members are arguing , in times of austerity , the EU budget cannot be used as an anchor to national budgets ; rather , it should reflect the difficult situation the EU Member States are in .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the treaty denies the Council the power to decide the national constitutions of the Member States .
It is not a business based on normal scenarios .
You can call me cynicism , but students do not always come to study , and the tourists do not always visit a limited period .
Is the reason for this situation the global financial crisis , which has turned into an economic crisis , or are we dealing with our own mistakes , negligence and lack of action here ?
The second &apos; but &apos; concerns the role of the Belgian Presidency in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon .
The main objective of these regimes was and is to maintain this great country , which is a country with completely different nations .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we still have to deal with its negative consequences .
This is true in many areas in Japan , but I acknowledge the right of Japan , for example , to safeguard its own rice market , to pay higher prices to its farmers than to farmers in the global market , and to oppose mass imports that will disappear among farmers , just as I recognise the rights to protect certain sectors of our economic activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I refer to two concepts : coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
I am therefore determined to work on this new strategy to increase the social priority , as I said to you when we discussed the guidelines for a broader policy for the next term .
So , Commissioner , I want to get straight to the point and ask you what medium-term measures - and I use many changes - the Commission intends to address these weaknesses .
That is what has been lacking so far , or this has not been clear enough for our citizens .
Citizens are not interested , and that is quite right .
( The sitting was closed at 00.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal by supporting the report by Mrs Muscardini , who , like the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta , thank you very much .
At the same time , Romania has supported an open doors policy , in particular , to strengthen NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that this must also be done to avoid the consequences of this disaster and to rebuild the conditions in which it is settled .
I am also , of course , not only talking about the accidents at work that quite often happen , but also about the use of hazardous chemical substances in labour processes .
In the first half of 2010 , informal meetings with the European Parliament took place several times .
It is now important to focus particular attention on islands and on the outermost regions where , in addition to the usual obstacles , infrastructure , personal , commercial and agricultural property devastation has now emerged , as in many cases they are unable to return to normal activity without delay , especially those regions that are responsible for tourism , as the information provided by the media may discourage tourist movements .
This long-winded disruption in this industry , with such huge financial losses , has not been the case since 11 September , and despite the financial difficulties that all Member States are currently facing , I would like to encourage them to support plans to help industry , which simply cannot suffer any more .
At the same time , we must acknowledge that our risks are also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of the resolution because the situation in the Congo is terrible .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a small number of linguistic or more accurately observations .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
It may be desirable for something to happen - something that can be desired to happen - but reality must be seen .
Consumer organisations tend to introduce binding measures for collective redress in all Member States and to combine them with other options , such as extending the existing dispute settlement mechanisms ( GSP ) to cover collective claims .
This is not a problem in Turkey &apos;s obligations , as some people have said .
I would like to ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin and should not be subject to long and suffering journeys to countries where their meat is used ?
That is what we have to do .
I certainly want to know , ladies and gentlemen , where human rights defenders have disappeared , who are pleased , like us , that the West is secular and pluralistic , and who are shamefully turning a blind eye away from the Middle East , with a little left religion .
This is what is happening at the moment and we are talking to the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who are wasting our money are unbearable , but Mr Schulz , politicians who are now avoiding deficits and debt hiding behind the back of the younger generations are simply irresponsible .
I must thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the individual political groups for this .
We believe that the Member States must act now .
Mr President , the European Commission and Parliament have worked very well on the instrument for democracy and human rights ; in fact , relations have been very balanced .
We must strive to ensure that the proposed programmes provide maximum support to the reforms underway in these countries in order to bring them closer to the European Union .
It is also very important for each Member State to establish national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information , in other words , the availability of healthcare , procedures and the necessary documentation .
In the past , we have put all events in the Soviet Union under ideological pressure and now we are discussing trade in the context of absolute freedom of the individual .
Whether it is a private fund or a public fund , the report deals with a very specific matter , namely that Parliament provides for , firstly , that there are no legal requirements to be reimbursed for the fund &apos;s deficit in subsidies , and secondly , that is definitely not the case with a deficit subsidy .
Their reputation is , of course , probably the most expensive since the Helenos Aires from Trojka , when thousands of ships were built .
Aid which leads to distortions of competition undermines the future of the European car industry and will have a negative impact both on employment and on technology .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , there are some aspects that I believe we should take into account in the forthcoming debate .
You have already heard MEPs from the various groups saying that we want to see a stronger Stability and Growth Pact that provides for the reverse voting mechanism .
, Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) So I think it is very important that we keep pace with what is really being discussed here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
In order to show solidarity with the campaign aimed at putting an end to this barbaric ritual , I would call on you all today to display the rocket that characterises our opposition to this practice .
Democracy control remains on the sidelines , because national governments &apos; questions about the main instruments are entrusted to the Commission and to the incoming Troika , and the Commission is handing over to the national governments .
New Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
After threats from the Commission to bring the case up , Sweden is once again spending the deca-BDE .
For those of us from the countryside and those who sit in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , it is clear that the current situation in which many livestock farmers find themselves is totally uncompromising .
The peoples deserve transparent information , which is easy to understand and available .
I believe that it is our duty to support the Chinese people in building a harmonious society .
In the vote , I supported these two systems because I am convinced that , in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe , we must be demanding and bold in order to safeguard our future .
It is also important for the organisers of the initiative - public or non-governmental organisations - to clearly and openly indicate the theme and purpose of the initiative , but it does not require a motion for a resolution .
In Latvia , more than 90 % of the population is Russian-speaking .
Here , I would like to applaud the apology of Prime Minister Fischer , as well as the recent Czech proposal , which requires the Ministry of Health to take specific measures to ensure that such violations never happen again .
I supported the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity which is used as a standard benchmark by policy makers throughout the world .
The financial and economic crisis has now completely damaged the effects of globalisation , and reviewing the funding criteria for the EGF is our considered response .
in writing . - ( PT ) The current resolution of 17 February 2008 includes the declaration of independence of Kosovo , which was acknowledged by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to draw up a joint strategy for Kosovo in line with the planned accession of Kosovo to the EU .
Parliament can be seen as a leader in terms of transparency compared to any other institution , so I would not treat the issue of transparency in Parliament as a priority , because we are much more open than any national parliament in terms of access to European Parliament documents and the transparency and activity of MEPs .
It was an internal political decision of Umbert Bossi , the Italian Minister for the Interior .
The signs sent by the Human Rights Monitoring Centre in Athens - my region - and by many other organisations should be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I am sorry that this resolution on banning the use of thrombin by soldiers and eggs has been adopted .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and I will follow the course of the ongoing investigation closely .
However , the European Commission &apos;s data are not entirely appropriate for the introduction of disciplined measures for countries with the highest levels of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption and emissions in sectors outside the ETS by 20 % .
Moving on to the second question , I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission understands the need for an interdisciplinary approach to AMR .
The trialogue negotiations held yesterday give rise to much hope of reaching a final agreement .
The forecasts made up in the context of approximately 27 % annual growth over the coming years indicate that this sum will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal must be adapted in such a way that the text complies with the form of a regulation and not the form of a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what the ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement shadow rapporteurs .
I voted in favour of this report because this EU financial support will help people who have become hostages of globalisation to find work , return to the labour market and emerge from the recession .
Since the Internet is a key instrument for better conditions and development , as well as providing citizens with knowledge in the cultural field , in particular , through the use of video and audiovisual material , I welcome the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in the development of radio spectrum , growth and innovative software .
All this increases my usual concern about cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe , and about the problems faced by a state of over 80 million citizens : these are factors that only strengthen my firm belief that Turkey cannot come to Europe , which depends , above all , on the spirit of Christianity .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This is against environmental and consumer protection because old , energy-intensive and potentially hazardous equipment would once again be sold .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I would like to thank the white mayor , Mr Reitemander , and the local councils , for the opportunity to disguise the monstrous repercussions of these young people .
Thirdly , I ask Mrs Kroes to speed up the digitisation of the material carried out by the Member States if we want to be proud of this flagship project in the future .
Anyone who has also suffered the consequences of the mathematical disaster caused by the technological defects in Baia Mare and then of the toxic cyanide slippage into water , which has caused extensive consequences for the Tislands in Hungary and in the Danube will make every effort to ensure that something similar does not happen again in the European Union .
This is the responsibility of everyone : the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In the future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion per year .
Secondly , displaced persons have the right to return home and return their wealth , that is , the right to move freely , as you said , across distinctive boundaries .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which proposes to reject the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we had the courage to convene this summit at the summit to invite the social partners to participate in it for a long time ( before the summit on employment is held in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague ) , and that we will try to reach the conclusions that are worthy of the June Council .
It was at first reading that the European Parliament created good foundations for the correct application of the rules for cross-border healthcare , so that patients can receive the necessary hospital and hospital healthcare in another Member State , in accordance with the relevant rules and without blocking the courts .
It was also proposed in the Barnier report , but we have not yet reached an agreement .
There is no time to waste .
We can see that , with another perverse example of reality , the European Parliament is trying to interfere in Venezuela .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a debate document containing new data and a wide range of consumer opinions on this issue , and we will shortly analyse the results of the public hearing .
Thank you for your presence .
I would like to add that when someone is detained , he is guaranteed this right in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights .
I believe that this amendment will be supported by a majority tomorrow .
The Copenhagen Communication provides the basis for continuing the European Union &apos;s positions on the most important aspects , which allow us to take the lead and help us to achieve success in Copenhagen .
Secondly , at the moment , the Commission does not yet have clear answers to many of the questions and problems raised by honourable Members , such as the geographical coverage or Objective 2 regions , suitable funding basis , transitional agreements or the status of specific regions .
Secondly , the protection of fundamental rights is a priority in the Stockholm Programme , which sets out strategic guidelines for the development of the areas of freedom , security and justice in Europe .
in writing . - ( SV ) We have once again chosen to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to help some 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering the consequences of the economic crisis , while exceptional times require exceptional measures .
On the basis of these studies , the Commission will be able to abstain if it proves to be ineffective , unnecessary or costly .
In the Arab League Plan , the Saudi peace plan provides for an end to the violence by recognising Israel &apos;s right to exist .
