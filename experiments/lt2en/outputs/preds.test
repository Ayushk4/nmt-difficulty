I must therefore disagree with Mr Lambsdorff when he thinks that the whole package has only one strong side, that is, reverse qualified majority voting.

We must sustain all of these benefits.
I believe that we must vote in favour of Claude Moraes's report as part of the overall package of the European Union asylum and migration system.

The most important aspect of this initiative concerns the fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity.
In my home country, Estonia, this fund was not used, and when I asked why, I was told that the conditions were too stringent and that the path to doing so was not permitted, which was still 1 000 people.
I believe that together, we can formulate basic principles which should be based on future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism and facilitate it.
Mr President, it is particularly worrying to see that the number of violent acts of violence against Christians and their communities is increasing.
Proposals are also being made to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to look closely at the debt situation, to improve economic governance guaranteed by the Euro Group in the euro area, and to introduce effective and reliable instruments for preventing and related problems in the euro area, which can include the creation of a European Monetary Fund.
Another problem is the services tax on outsourcing.

(The President cut off the speaker and asked for order)
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power plant has caused a huge disaster, with radioactive contamination affecting many people who were near to nuclear power plants, and they have suffered injuries.
We need to evaluate and have a full understanding of what we already have, of the impact of all this, and of what is perhaps lacking, and of what is partly the same, so that we can come up with new instruments and more ideas on the basis of such measures.
I believe that this is a joint responsibility, so it would be good if everyone were to become involved in combating the crisis.
But we talked about this comprehensive approach before.
This 13th session will be the most important for 2010, which will include high-level meetings and discussions with the ministers of government on many important issues, as the Commissioner and the Minister have already mentioned, such as the impact of the global financial crisis on human rights situation.
I also think that the number of errors or failures is relatively low - but they are still too high.
(CS) This proposal to revise the directive on late payments, which we are discussing today and which is particularly necessary, is undoubtedly better than the original proposal.

Therefore, it is very important to move to 30%, so I will conclude by echoing Barack Obama's words when he said that we could leave our future work to our competitors or that we could seize the opportunity of the age that they have already begun.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to make four comments.
That is why I and several other Members have called for an expert, silent organ trafficking and the deliberate killing of people in China to take their organs - this expert will come and speak tomorrow.
President-in-Office of the Council, we would like to thank you for a very constructive and broad report and wish you every success during your presidency!
These initiatives, strengthened by the EC, allow us to work together on specific projects and programmes to join forces across all the institutions and provide an opportunity to develop a common job.
- (SK) Once again, we have problems with respect for the rights of minorities in Slovakia and, as a result, the Minister for Education, a member of the ruling nationalists' party, is responsible.
Given that the necessary safeguards, such as the possibility of presenting an administrative complaint to European citizens and requiring them to be treated in the same way as US citizens, as well as strict information storage times, cooperation between the European Union and the United States is, in this case, an appropriate contribution to overcoming the negative consequences of globalisation.
The EIB can and must play an important role in the recent events in the Mediterranean region.
I therefore support the proposal to launch a study into the production margins and the distribution chain.
However, if you always emphasise the'polluter pays' principle - and I am ready to discuss this with you - then the Member States are primarily responsible for congestion because they are not providing sufficient infrastructure.
The first is credits to promote student mobility.
However, what is important here is that we know that, although the fires are particularly frequent along the southern borders of Europe, we have the opportunity, in this case, to strengthen the impact and link with the citizens, who, in Europe, represent added value for response.
Today, Europe has stayed behind, regardless of whether it is possible to have a higher percentage of educated people than those countries that do better, such as China or India.
We therefore need more and better Europe: a more united and more ambitious Europe for itself.
I am sure they are a step in the right direction.
The Greek Communist Party opposed and voted against the amendments to adapt the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: the most surprising thing is that, while growth rates in Albania are steadily improving - in 2010, global economic instability has risen by 2% and expected growth to exceed 3% in 2011 - rather than decreasing, social tensions.
Human trafficking is still a serious problem in the European Union.
There are also other issues that I would like to highlight by echoing what Mr Paparizov said.
The EU must make a significant contribution to the stabilisation, development and capability of Southern Sudan.
As you said, Article 13 of the Sri Lanka Constitution should be amended, which provides for decentralisation in terms of regional administration, and the EU can provide effective support in this area.
Of course, let me reiterate that there may be differences of opinion as well as differences between the Commission, the Council and some Members of this House in terms of water regulation; there are those who prefer separate laws for river and maritime transport.
I agree with the arguments behind this proposal, which are based on the need for us to have a coherent and comprehensive plan for developing investments in the European Union's energy infrastructure, allowing the Commission to monitor the state of investment projects in the energy sector.
It was reassured that there was a global consensus in 1995 that women and men are equal in all respects, including political, economic, legal and social issues in 1995.
The Serbian authorities must make every effort to ensure that the country is properly implemented by the rule of law and democracy, and by all means, to ensure that the level of corruption in the country continues to fall, and that strict sanctions are imposed on managers who abuse their situation.
In short, it is unlikely that, on the basis of the guidelines proposed by this Commission, we will build a Europe that we are fighting for - where justice and social progress, economic and social cohesion prevailing, cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights and peace is promoted.
From the perspective of democracy and legality, it is very important to inform our citizens about what the EU is doing.
We Germans would be wrong about our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to European unity after the historic events I have mentioned here.
To put it plainly, both Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner will do the same.
As I have said many times before in this House, it always seemed important to me that the European nations work closely together.
- Report: Elles
In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained from the vote.
Furthermore, creating a mandatory register for all lobbyists wishing to visit Parliament and the Commission on a regular basis will be an important step towards making the communication between these organisations and European institutions more transparent.
However, if we adopt everything at first reading, then Parliament will lose its rights.
This is a very important step that enables the human rights and fundamental freedoms of European Union citizens to be strengthened more effectively.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the Kirilov report will take place in the next few weeks, and I am therefore pleased that the matter is urgent.
I was not at all sure of the need for this legislation because most vans are purchasing companies, both large and small, which already have a very good understanding of the need for economic efficiency and energy efficiency.
I propose drawing up a study of the consolidated accounts.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a general observation and then two or three questions, the unequal number of time you will give me.
We must also remember that the accession of Turkey to the European Union will become countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria in our neighbours.
I think that, finally, we need to understand that we cannot talk about economic policy without always thinking about employment criteria.
What can we expect from the EU?
Let us not forget that we are paying for all this to our electorate, who is going through a difficult time.
However, for the same reason, ECAs can also very distort trade if their financial operations are not regulated by common rules.
I believe that the Single Market could only be well managed if there is good quality and updated information about its operation.
in writing. - (ET) The reality of the global economic crisis (i.e. the economic downturn and growing unemployment) in the EU labour market is such that more and more people will be made redundant, which will further increase the number of people suffering from poverty and exclusion in Europe.
At the time, they have, of course, already had both a flag and an anthem, but they have taken on a new state.
In a way, these aspects include the corporate social responsibility, but without national systems, there is no possibility of implementing them.
This is a real compromise.
In addition, proper and operational assistance in the event of an accident must be ensured, providing passengers with the basic services they need and providing the requisite.
The Council is in favour of a common text, so the President of the European Parliament must now announce that the budget has been definitively adopted.
We must support the creation of a private financing mechanism to promote public and legal initiatives to strengthen the EU resettlement programme.
However, we also want to eliminate misleading advertising on the Internet, which invites people to buy medicines that not only treat but even harm patients.
Mr President, I would like to make an oral amendment to this amendment and delete two parts of this amendment, the words' Colombia army'and' Colombia'.
I would also urge the Commission to take concrete steps and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against the Roma people in Europe.
Mr President, I have once again considered that this is one of those reports that many people can congratulate.
We must point out once again that, following the disaster, too long, the decision to mobilise the EUSF and the real provision of EU aid to the Member States and regions affected have been postponed.
There needs to be legal evidence, and that is why we have asked the French Government to provide us with individual cases.
Europe cannot only be a sum of 27 national interests.
Mr Reinfeldt will now present the European Council's activities during this half year.
The negative impact of harsh measures, which will make people working in the public sector redundant from the service, must be transformed into a positive impact on the newly established enterprises, through the spirit of enterprise and the tax introduction of a company, so that they create the profitable private sector that is necessary to get our countries out of the mammunitions they face.
The two territorial entities have not been able to develop a common vision, which has resulted in a halt to progress.
Is this free trade agreement only fit for the current world and for the current division of economic power between Europe and India, or will it be proper in 10 or 15 years' time?
The main objectives of the radio spectrum policy programme are to ensure broadband access throughout the EU by 2013, and the Internet speed by 2020.
The economic crisis in Moldova was not only caused by the global crisis, but above all by the fact that urgent action was not taken at the moment of the crisis in the Republic of Moldova.
European workers and poor must bring their forces together against this catastrophic policy and fight for a truly democratic and socialist Europe, which means resisting the policies of this new EU Commission.
The European Parliament defends its prerogatives provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Animal welfare requirements are formally included in the Treaty on European Union and must be complied with in the formulation of policies in sectors such as the internal market.
This is, first of all, at the level of regions and their cultural heritage, and it is an asset which will be taken into account and which will be highlighted when regional development policy is being considered.
I think we should concentrate on it right now.
You will need all your abilities to give a new impetus to the EU's international trade policy.
In fact, this reserve is the'accounting' method, which should be applied in any emergency case that could happen during the current financial year.
Let us honour the memory of our friends in Tunisia in a minute's silence.
There are many errors and one accuser: the euro.
Bearing in mind the initiatives that I have just described, I feel that there is now a solid basis on which to improve our fisheries and agricultural sectors through innovative research under the framework programme.
We are discussing too technocratic.
I therefore congratulate Mr Millán Mon on this excellent report, which comes at such a timely time to strengthen relations between the two continents.
We have therefore chosen to simplify EU legislation significantly.
Unfortunately, the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left are important, which are why those living in the EU, but who do not belong to one of its Member States, will not be able to sign initiatives, and thus prevent the equal participation of the population regardless of nationality, and do not guarantee that signatures are drawn up with signatories' codes.
I urge an independent commission to include local and international legal experts in the wake of and accusations against the violent incidents which followed the December 2007 elections.
NATO and our so-called Western credibility are also dependent on results in Afghanistan.
All this is far too far, and it must be stopped.
The development of children's public and private operators and the development of teaching and mobility systems as a matter of practice implementing multi-level governance policies could become effective instruments for improving regional policy.
I hope that my fellow Members from Spain and Italy will support this, but we cannot wait any longer because the whole world is watching the innovation market.
I also believe that we have a duty to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that these requirements are properly implemented in future strategies, starting with the next reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
Mr President, in the ongoing negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Vietnam, we must also respect human rights and civil liberties.
Without wanting to undermine some of the important measures proposed in this report, I want to draw attention to the most important element of this problem.
These techniques nonetheless allow the economy and jobs to be protected from bureaucracy, unfair competition or unforeseen price volatility.
This will not have a negative impact on meagre resources, because at the moment, as an additive, only a small number of modest catches are being rendered.
The proposed sanctions are proportionate and necessary and are expected to discourage commercial practices that have been chosen by commercial operators.
In my opinion, this criterion is also unjustified and discriminatory because, for example, in the case of Portugal, the majority of these families live in housing in rural areas.
This is measuring the level of poverty by using purely financial indicators and without taking into account the diversity of the 27 Member States; it is based on simple solvency that can be summarised.
We will therefore need both resources for official development aid and new funding.
The results of the ethical audit of this project have been positive and have been acknowledged.
In my opinion, the newly proposed 75% cofinancing level is too high.
I would like to make two points, ladies and gentlemen.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for bringing my attention to the Tunisian problem.
The rapporteur deplores, in particular, that citizens do not understand the rights that it gives them.
While it is very important for us all to create an area of security, justice and freedom in the European Union and, of course, the European democratic model in which many of us regard Europol as an instrument that can be adapted, it is nevertheless essential to us that resources - above all, human resources, but also technical resources for combating organised crime and all illegal trade - are subject to strict control of our citizens' rights.
Therefore, it is particularly important to adopt any measure that would increase the transparency and independence of impact assessments, as this will help maximise the dual role of this instrument in the decision-making process and ensure the quality and relevance of the activities of EU institutions.
The second is that the strategy should help strengthen internal cohesion in the EU, in other words, interweaving.
I can add that this is not the direction the Commission has taken, because its proposal focuses on - on the regulation adopted by this House - the reform of the current system of agencies, which are private, and on strengthening the very stringent transparency requirements in order to avoid conflicts of interest and to ensure fair work on credit rating.
It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a completely independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Even before the crisis we are experiencing today, the Member States of the European Union have already been facing social problems caused by weak economic growth, difficult demography and by difficulties resulting from the fact that we are living in an increasingly globalised world economy.
There are, however, reasons for some concern that the enthusiasm of the Moldovans can slow down.
We have always stood firm in this House in defending the autonomous rights of the Tibetan people, which does not mean self-determination or independence rights.
Although the directive will soon be drafted, I voted with the other Members in favour of the resolution setting out the position that Parliament should adopt on this matter.
In this respect, it is important to establish a system for monitoring and verifying medicinal products that provides patients with reliable information.
It is worth fighting for them and that is why I intend to do exactly that.
These costs will still be subject to certain exceptions if the Member States requesting them have convincing reasons to do so.
This framework decision should not result in the creation of unnecessary bureaucratic procedures when the measures already available to deal with the problems in question are more appropriate.
The Bank does not foresee the crisis coming, nor has it been characterised by its own regulation, which is certainly not ideal.
However, as a serious organisation, the European Union should be better equipped to react effectively in such cases and, in particular, should be better equipped to react in urgent cases.
- Report: Kaczmarek
So we should only welcome this if these measures are not effective.
I promised to inform the European institutions of this civil protest.
The EU and other industrialised countries should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 and, in the long term, to reduce emissions by 80% by 80% compared with 1990 levels.
- Report: Maria do Céu Patrão Neves
I would like to address more specifically two unresolved issues that have been raised several times during this debate.
First of all, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my gratitude to the European Parliament for its cooperation and compromise, which enabled us in the Conciliation Committee to reach an agreement that benefits bus and coach passengers in the EU, particularly disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility.
One of the reasons is our divided defence market.
Even at the beginning of this period, there were important issues in terms of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable forms of energy.
The creation of the EEAS requires a series of decisions, perhaps also to amend the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations, which also require the Commission's proposal and must be adopted under the codecision procedure.
We fully support the development of civil capacity to ensure a proper distribution of resources.
in writing. - The situation across North Africa is really dangerous, but it is hopeful.
Coordination requires constant improvements and the responsibility of the Member States in this area should definitely be greater.
The strong support of the Irish electorate gives us the opportunity and the strength to further strengthen our prosperity and, most importantly, build a strong and federal Europe.
Although protection of the environment and public health is inseparable, I believe that we must harmonise the needs of consumers and producers.
This is a complicated problem that we must resolve together.
To address this problem and create a global response system and register for illegal logging and suspecting parties, we must work with the main consumers of timber products, namely the US, China, Russia and Japan, using the Internet, an appropriate UN body using the latest satellite technology.
Naturally, we must not allow the industry to reduce the competitiveness of this industry in the short term.
I would like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
The current economic and social crisis has brought particular attention to the European public and European institutions to combat unemployment and social exclusion.
This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to say that I believe that this issue is too important for us to continue to live in lies with how we have lived in Europe.
We did not, of course, know, as has been said, the names of the candidates and we did not have a woman's candidacy, which was explained in due course by Commissioner Barnier.
We move on about how many people are not present in the European elections and how many negative votes are in referendums.
We will have to pollute what happened and we will keep you informed, Mr Coelho.
(PL) Mr President, horizontal cooperation agreements cover a very broad regulatory area, and because of loopholes in legislation - whether deliberately or unwittingly - competition can be destroyed.
We also need a common, more effective and more protective European asylum system.
That concludes Question Time.
I also realise that you all want to take part in some form of police cooperation that respects human rights and does not forget the values of the European Union.
Mr Picas was able to describe his Guernica act in the same terrible scenario when our Guernica was shot down to its foundations 70 years ago by the College of Condor.
In that respect, speculators are also trying to speculate on the bad economic situation and the generation is making it worse.
Mr Bové is absolutely right, and Mrs Fajmon is deep...
We must promote not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small farms, organic farms and the distribution of products locally, ensuring the diversity of agriculture throughout Europe.
The Rapkay report on the amendment of the Staff Regulations concerning the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) is a very important document for the European Union's foreign policy.
We therefore believe - and we promise to discuss this again at first reading - that the first expenditure reflects our priorities, so we agree with the rapporteur on the issues of multilingualism and buildings that we have always prioritised in terms of legislation.
A few weeks ago, I took the lead on the delegation of this Parliament's Committee on International Trade (INTA), which attended the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva.
With this in mind, Europe will be able to move forward with a high head.
I have asked the Member States to propose names, including the women's names.
Firstly, it is very important to maintain the geographical distribution of financial aid from the EU budget to the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, in accordance with the terms of the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, as well as to continue to support these countries in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.
We believe that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or four other Member States.
This is good reason not to invite Lukashenko to the EU summit in response to the Belarus opposition.
It is very important to refer to the real humanist and holistic aspects of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market.
Mr President, I would like to express my support for the thoughts of colleagues on the rights of disabled passengers, Mrs Kadenbach on children, on fire-fighting hotels and, in particular, on the need to deploy fire-fighting water sprays in all EU hotels, as well as on the need to prepare a new proposal that is consistent with future challenges.
I was also preparing to ask a question about gender balance in the Commission, so I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy Ashton on her appointment.
The report clearly emphasises that Member States are the only ones with the right to regulate a defence and national security policy, which we consider very important.
Furthermore, the most important concern was the Member States that have not had rules on lower exposure limits and disclosure of the stock price gap due to asset strikes and surpluses.
I would also like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, for his approach.
In other words, the Copenhagen Accord is full of ambition that must be taken into account in the context of the post-2012 climate change agreement and provides a basis for the financial package and calls for serious commitments on reducing emissions.
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are responsible for around four million lives each year.
As far as trade is concerned: safe, unhealthy medicinal products, do not infringe copyright and its criminal nature mean that they are produced in emerging countries, such as India and Brazil, and that they may encroach on the West pharmaceutical industry, which is why I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is not allowed to sell on more competitive prices.
Finally, Members have the right to take the floor.
This is unacceptable.
We want to be involved in this.
We will therefore have to find the right level of funding and technological compensation.
This is also an area where we can take stronger action as regards competition and consumer protection policies.
It is also a shame that these policies require us to support the result of the second referendum, when they were actually opposed to the result of the first referendum.
As the joint author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan, I wish to thank my fellow Members who voted in favour of this document today.
To conclude, Mr President, Minister, I will come up with a proposal for future generations.
It is absolutely necessary to establish clear rules and objectives for the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in order to consolidate the European Union's internal market in a sustainable way, improve environmental quality and recovery of raw materials.
The Heads of State or Government have also stressed that nuclear safety must not be limited to the territory of the European Union, but that we will ask our neighbours to carry out stress tests, too.
Dialogue between military and humanitarian institutions is essential in order to promote mutual understanding.
Work on the Commission continues to work towards a more systematic assessment of the public financial processes, including aspects of the budget based on results.
I will deal with this as Trade Commissioner first.
The Commission could therefore come up with amended or new proposals, depending on the situation.
The United States must also introduce clear, transparent criteria for refusing to issue visas to some Member States.
An open question is only about funding.
To other Members, I would like to state that Turkey's constructive criticism is necessary; we ourselves are critical friends.
Studies show that the profits derived from trafficking in human beings go beyond the profits of drug smuggling and trafficking.
In my own country, farmers feel completely disappointed and insulted, as it is assumed in Parliament that they do not know what they are doing and that they have to say.
No.
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution; analysing the negative effects of the liberalisation of markets on the local economy, it stresses the strategic importance of tariff protection.
Overall, I am voting in favour of the proposals in this report aimed at boosting the European economy by providing greater financial support for projects in the field of energy.
So the report on the European Refugee Fund, which promotes the resettlement of refugees in the EU, is all the more incomprehensible.
This assessment may increase.
In order to highlight the value of domestic work, economists use mathematical models.
Only when we are fully informed about such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law.
Commissioner C.
It is also necessary, especially in the run-up to the conference in Copenhagen, for the EU and other international players to align their policies in the areas of international trade, climate change, humanitarian aid and development.
I would like to mention Commissioner Rehn's statement, which I respect, that Nigeria is a very poor country: it is not true, Nigeria is a very rich country that has been tortured by a corrupt and unimaginable governing class which seized its resources and impoverished millions of citizens.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, I would ask you - do not be such a pessimist.
I therefore call on the Council immediately to publish its position on Parliament's new proposal so that the ACP countries can take advantage of these measures announced in 2010, and I ask the Commission to ensure that producers and exporters outside the ACP countries comply with the social and environmental protection requirements on a mutual basis.
It is therefore essential for the Commission, as coordinator for the Energy Community, to strongly remind Ukraine of its commitment to ensuring the supply of gas to Europe.
in writing. - Of course, we deplore all the victims of aggressive and authoritarian regimes, ignoring the atrocities that have been committed in Europe or former European colonies, for example.
The main objective of the regulation should be to introduce a new common control and culture of responsibility, not to impose a bureaucratic and costly system for scrutinising each product.
Member of the Commission. - The EU's current competition policy in the area of vertical agreements is very favourable to online sales, and I am sure you, Mr President, know that.
On the other hand, the report certainly contains clear recommendations for second and third points, and these recommendations go in the right direction.
In the field of transport, more active needs to be done by imposing greater restrictions on vehicle manufacturers in order to produce more efficient fuel efficient vehicles.
The financial situation in some countries in the euro area which have been discussed today clearly demonstrates the risk of non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact agreements.
I therefore think that it would make sense to think about how we can best use the financial resources saved so that we can expand the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery and include a new and specialised financial instrument in support of energy efficiency, as well as initiatives in the area of renewable energy.
The Commission, and we parliamentarians, have deliberately raised the issue of the handling of investment fund transactions, because we all base our work on the assumption that the sector will keep the promise it has made to resolve this issue independently, without legal pressure.
I will turn to two issues here on the Europe 2020 strategy.
(EL) Madam President, as far as the artificial industry is concerned, I should like to remind the House that Pakistan is the world's fourth largest cotton producer, with 9% of world production, while the European Union produces at least 5.5% of world cotton.
In this case, the Council, and this Parliament in particular, is also taking part in the decisions on the composition of the College, the portfolios that you will propose, and the programme for the next five years that you will present.
We have to realise that this takes a year and that we have to move forward in 2009.
Of course, the behaviour of the Portuguese people reflects the situation, as the conditions of worsening the living of workers and people have already begun, while inequalities, as well as poverty, are increasing.
These objectives, President of the Commission, President of the European Council, have already been laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy.
We are already in discussion with many Arab countries about the initiatives to supply gas via Turkey, hopefully, in the Nabucco gas pipeline.
Therefore, measures to eradicate this disease completely are one of the health policy objectives to which national governments can best contribute if this instrument is flexible.
As this is my last speech to this House, I would like to thank you, all colleagues and workers for your cooperation.
I know that the election rules are very different in different Member States at the moment.
Many doctors of common practice are too slowly starting to treat the disease from dementia in order to avoid exceeding their budget, with the opposite effect.
Paradoxically, this measure could easily abuse not only extremists but also very strong and powerful interest groups, which is why we believe that 1 000 declarations of support are not a high threshold if we compare it with the European Union's demographic potential.
The 2010 budget sets out this systematic approach.
According to the report of the UN working group, human trafficking victims are made up of different social situations, from the richest to the poor, from well-educated to completely illiterate, from the Americans to older women.
President-in-Office of the Council. - This is indeed a very important question.
If we want this position to be adopted at national level, we need better integrated and better European economic governance, including a tax on financial transactions, which I ask the Commission to thoroughly examine, including in the context of Europe.
I think mutual recognition of prescriptions in the Member States is very important, not only with regard to healthcare but also with regard to rehabilitation, but we still have time to complete this matter.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports, which raise important questions about the contribution of the European Union's trade policy to some of the key public policy objectives: respect for human rights, the pursuit of economic welfare and social justice, the realisation of a sustainable growth target and the sustainability of the environment and, in particular, the climate system.
Consumers will be able to use certain means if they purchase a product that does not meet the terms of the contract, and if a suitable product is not provided, they will have the right to claim damages.
Mr President, the reason for this haste was that 57 people who were brutally murdered, accompanied by a politician, to register a provincial guardian in future elections.
This new smart metric system will enable stronger supervision, more detailed assessments of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, as well as recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans.
The people of Syria deserve the long-awaited political reforms, especially those concerning freedom of expression and assembly, to participate in political life and governance.
Many of these are UK citizens sold inside the UK without any external sources, if I may say so.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has returned to the Third quarter of 2009, so this could encourage us to believe that we have already gone through the worst times.
In this case, Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reform aimed at improving the efficiency of public administration, accelerating the reform of the pensions and health care, improving the operation of the labour market and the effectiveness of the negotiations on the wage system, improving the operation of the product market and the business environment, as well as supporting the stability of the banking and financial sector.
We believe that it is still important to point out the following: respect for the sovereignty of the country and its peoples, the mutual interest, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account the country's specific characteristics; evaluation of what each country can give to an agreement in economic, social and cultural terms.
I believe that the transition to a sustainable, green economy will also take place without excessively strong legal instruments.
Everyone is dying how much the US and NATO, of course, in peacekeeping in Europe.
I think we should use this debate as an opportunity to look at what is vital for Europe: growth, jobs, dynamism in the small businesses sector, more innovation, more effective public procurement, and that is what citizens will decide about our work.
I think that it is not up to us to pretend about possible developments in these countries.
The second project includes concessions.
Mr President, during the European Parliament elections of 2004, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, so we agreed to many outrageous constituents on restaurants and Albanians.
Indeed, by very much sparing state action, increasing the EU budget is a project of trust in the overall and strengthening the actions taken at supranational level.
I know that we have a good message, so let us take it for granted.
There are recommendations in this report on how air agreements should be analysed in accordance with the content and procedures to be adopted.
This language law brings the balance down.
Perhaps, when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force definitively on 1 December, it will also be possible to leave the debate on domestic policy issues in the UK behind this Chamber.
This is the difference between the real situation and the European Parliament's unattainable dreams.
We also support the full involvement of every national parliament, in line with their budgetary management and control rights, in order to increase transparency, responsibility and accountability for the decisions made, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, there are five more questions on economic governance and on the Europe 2020 strategy.
I therefore believe that SOLVIT should be actively involved by the national authorities, the European Commission and Members of this House.
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines, and now, Mr Michel, the main actors and liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation: the promotion of an agro-industrial model to protect the interests of the large agro-industrial production industry, and therefore the quantitative impoverishment of the world's agricultural industry; a large proportion of investment in agriculture, and the promotion of 70% of the agricultural sector, which is guaranteeing the survival industry and the middlest of the survival industry.
Economically: the payments paid by producers are lower than the cost of production they face, and the CAP must enable it to solve this problem.
Once again, I urge the Commission to keep up the pressure on this promise in its relations with the government until it is included in Congolese law.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the great interest of this Parliament in the actions that have been taken in the European Union and beyond to address the challenges that some Member States are facing in the field of public finances.
We support the will of nations seeking a better life, greater power and better tomorrow.
They are supported by Irish Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).

I believe that this procedure will strengthen food security for the benefit of EU citizens, as well as greater clarity for the Member States and for third countries exporting meat products to the EU.

Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, which involves working, protecting and, in a way, supporting the people and ensuring that they do not lose their jobs and will not have to move towards a full retraining and capacity cycle within a year or two years; maintaining existing jobs.

We also carried out a review of the funds unused in 2009 in order to use the total amount of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for 2009.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for making it clear.
We can also see elements of this kind and an attempt to take a holistic approach, which was not as successful as we had imagined, but the right direction was nevertheless taken.
Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, which was sometimes a bit categorised, and also the Council, in which we tried to find reasonable solutions at night meetings and at many trialogues because, just one hour ago, they also approved the compromise that we found.
In order to ensure that comprehensive and coordinated action is taken, the Commission has set up a European Aviation Crisis Mechanism Mechanism Group together with the European Organisation for Sustainable Airs since 4 May 2010.

It is absolutely clear that we need to have a widespread energy mix that covers the energy mix, which will stabilise the energy situation, thereby enabling the diversity of energy sources in each country, including in Europe, to be realised.

My question concerns Pakistan, whose permanent instability, as we all know, is a factor in the crisis in the whole region and Afghanistan.

Last week, at a committee meeting, I called the Belgian Presidency a thorn.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran because I am concerned about the ongoing human rights violations there, in particular, violations of association, freedom of expression and of information, and because I share the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.

Furthermore, its private dimension not only improves Europe's image in shaping the world, but also supports European citizenship.

Secondly, there should be a temporary interinstitutional interview of the implementation mechanism.
However, it is positive that some of the agreements that we have reached are very good, such as the free trade agreement with Korea.
That is why it is important for Parliament to reiterate to the Commission the social clause enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that the current concept of constructive work with the European Union is incomparably more effective than a constant attempt to rewrite history.
It may be ridiculous, but so far, the European Commission has not found any arguments necessary or time to force the Latvian Government to halt discrimination on the grounds of language.

Neither should we accept the rationalisation of external costs at the beginning of the process, nor should we justify reducing traffic congestion and punishing the use of heavy goods vehicles alone, making the exception for ordinary cars, because the implementation of the old'polluter pays' principle would thus be discriminatory.

Moreover, from an initial point of view, we have some concerns.
The main objective of the governments of the European Union and its Member States, whether they be the centre-right or centre left, is to safeguard the profits of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the workers' shoulders in the European Union.

It must establish a partnership between the EU's regional policy in the name of peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa, which the Committee on Development started to implement when it adopted its report in April 2007.

However, I would like to draw the Members of this House's attention to the fact that the latest studies carried out by the European Cardiologists have once again shown that this methodology is very limited due to the low participation of women in such tests.
Our idea is not to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but also to prevent social and environmental objectives from being achieved.

The fact that orthodox festivals, bishops and patriarchies must be the citizens of Turkey is an absolute understanding.
The most important thing of the position adopted by this House - many measures that lack coherence - is not just about legislation, but also its implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon ensures that the European Union accedes to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

Indeed, if we do not go into the legal basis, it is a great achievement, given that this directive recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and opens up new opportunities for better treatment.
Over the years, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us its satisfaction with the fact that the EU budget is being used legally and regularly, and when I was in 2002 at the head of the European Commission, I was concerned about a lack of control over taxpayers' money.
This is a great challenge for me, and it is also a great honour.
If we are honest, we must acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and our emissions are still many times higher than those of China or India, for example.
I am convinced that further dialogue will be constructive.
We therefore regret that, as in the case of Europol, the rush has taken precedence, but not the desire to protect fundamental freedoms.
I welcome the Commission's proposal, which aims to diversify and simplify the methodology for allocating resources from the European Social Fund, so that Europe can respond to emerging economic and social challenges more quickly and effectively.
Frankly, I had to vote against the Commission's proposed composition, but, in addition to the weak candidates, there were some very good, including the Polish candidate, Janusz Lewandowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very nice, Mr Kirkhope, but besides the UK, there are, in fact, another 26 Member States in the European Union, so you understand that, while we are very attentive to the concerns that you have expressed, we must also take into account other legitimate interests.
I believe that we must be careful to maintain the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian response, even if sometimes it is hard to do so in crisis-hit areas.
Furthermore, it adds several paragraphs to what Parliament has already said before, for example, asking the Vice-President of the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to assess fully the results of the investigations carried out by all countries, including in the follow-up to the Goldstone report; recalls that, based on the responsibility and trust granted to the EU Member States, they must be subject to scrutiny by the non-governmental organisations, including those involved in the Goldstone report.
I also hope that this decision will contribute to the conservation of endangered fish species.
I hope that you will respond to my questions not as provocation but as a fifth for reflection.

The number of new infections continues to miss the development of treatment, and in 2009, two thirds of the people in need of treatment still have not received it - that means that 10 million people have not been able to obtain the effective treatment they need.
In fact, when it comes to human dignity, minorities are completely ignored.
I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify this fund.

We will shortly be holding the TEN-T meeting, where the Commission will make progress in developing the other modes of transport.

Sri Lanka is highly dependent on foreign direct investment and EU economic support in terms of its economic recovery.

The economic crisis and environmental policy can be balanced in order to achieve positive results, both in the environment and in job creation.
There are countries which do not use all the ESF funds granted to them, which remain about 30% or 40%.

I fully support the proposal for an information campaign to promote access to the contact points.
It seems strange to us that the Spanish Presidency calls us to combat the economic crisis and wants to achieve binding implementation of economic policy objectives.

It is often the workers themselves who are isolated and it is very difficult to reach trade unions in such situations.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the two Commissioners and the Commission for their views today.
However, in this situation, and while some amendments have helped to improve it, the Guillaume report is a realistic incentive to abuse the process, blocking the relevant services and depriving those cases that really need to be reviewed immediately.

It is necessary to draw attention to the problems faced by Roma women in particular due to poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence, and young Roma, because without qualifications, it is even more difficult for them to find a job during this economic crisis.

It is also a reminder of all political decision makers in their field of competence to make the freedom of the press effective, to really participate: they must be prepared to safeguard freedom of expression and to promote its development.
Mr President, I believe that the European Union has become too large and has too many cultures, and I simply do not trust this system, which will get worse.
It is now a little premature to report on the results of this analysis and, as the Member knows, every step of this process requires unanimous approval from the Council.
It should be noted that the prospect of EU integration is the largest incentive for the Balkan States to undertake the necessary reforms, as well as regional stability factors.
At a time when advertising gains an increasingly important role, it is necessary to lay down criteria to enable consumers and patients to know about and be certain about the effects of medicinal products.

This EUR 200 billion must be spent more purposefully than in previous years.
Together, we have made positive developments.
We will also work on social services of general interest during this term.

In this respect, there is a great need for reform in Turkey.
The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania.
