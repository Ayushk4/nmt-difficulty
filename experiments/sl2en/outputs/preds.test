In its proposal to the Council, the Commission asked the Greek authorities to submit, by mid-March, a detailed report on the implementation by outlining the measures taken and on the calendar of the implementation of the measures announced.

in writing. - The mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework is neither practical nor realistic about the uncertainty associated with: the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon, the end of this parliamentary term, the outcome of the European elections and the creation of the new Commission in the current economic circumstances.
As has become clear in the debate, there is an impossibility in this semester.

I am sure that this framework will develop over time, but I very much welcome the report by Mr Hökmark because it reinforces the proposal while maintaining the necessary balance.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports cooperation on illegal immigration, but only if we make it clear that we are, at the same time, strengthening the attack against illegal immigration.

Lithuania needs the talent, experience and work of these young people in order to overcome the abovementioned demographic challenges.

We want early consultations between the two parties when political incidents occur that could affect the other side.
However, it would have been better to complain about itself, about the European leaders.
I am therefore aware of the importance of this agreement and I confirm that I voted in favour of the agreement reached.
Thirdly, the internal market is a key factor in terms of security of supply.
We therefore fully agree with the rapporteur when, in paragraph 40, he calls on Turkey to'install a good atmosphere for negotiations by allowing the Turkish forces to negotiate freely the future of their country'.

Mr President, as Mr Papanikolaou said, the objective of the Culture Programme is to enrich the cultural experience of European citizens through the promotion of our common cultural heritage.

The debate is closed.
At the same time, fishermen are dependent on carelessness and unfair competition.
I believe that this clearly shows that there is limited integration in this area - but not only in this area.
For example, it is clear to us that we must continue to support these regions, which are currently not even achieving 75% of the European Union's average gross domestic product.
In the case of the mining sector, disasters often have a cross-border impact.
It is true that we are in the midst of a crisis and that a court that retains through voluntary contributions uses large sums of money.
It is strange that it is almost impossible to achieve the involvement of the parliaments of the partner countries in these agreements.
Another important factor is the passengers.
However, the protection itself must also include children.
The hopes surrounding the very important and sensitive issues of the common agricultural policy are very high.
The rapporteur, Mr Søndergaard, will join us later on because of the delay of the year, so I will ask him to speak later.
The Mediterranean diet also contains a semi-finished drain, a large amount of fruit and vegetables - so we very much welcome the Commission's school fruit programme - fish, moderate milk products and also wine.
There is a general desire in Parliament to review some of the key points of this directive, but unfortunately, there has been no meeting in recent days between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur in order to address 60 amendments.
I would therefore just like to express my surprise and demand that, next time, we are all aware of what needs to be done to be able to take the floor.
Another reason why I voted in favour of strengthening the OSCE is the aspect of human rights, including respect for the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms, which are key elements in the OSCE's comprehensive concept of security.
in writing. - I supported this report which puts forward proposals to combat violence throughout Europe and calls on all Member States to make this issue a priority.
My group, the ECR Group, is calling for a genuinely democratic and peaceful transition in Egypt.
Although I am aware that, in part, it is also up to the Member States to familiarise the Commission with all the changes in the economic situation, the Commission's approach should not remain the same.
That is why we are asking for the explicit recognition of regional governments in the Copenhagen agreement and their important role in mitigation and adaptation measures.
This is why I am grateful to you all, regardless of the parties that have made a genuine effort to make culture important and to be able to speak to the people.

The EU is not a democratic one, and so it is not appropriate to protect human rights.
I would also like to highlight the fundamental feature of the fund, which is that it helps people more than businesses, and from this point of view, we cannot consider it an apparatus that keeps companies living in life with no real hope of operating economically but quite the opposite.

After months of uncertainty for Opel Europe, a new phase is beginning which, for some reason, is a cause for hope and some reason for concern.
In Poland, the country I represent, some 250 000 people suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and the experts estimate that this figure will triple by 2040.
Given that we have 27 countries with 27 different healthcare systems, the Commission proposal, based exclusively on Article 95 - the famous harmonised article - will result in dispersion of national health systems, and therefore the Member States no longer take responsibility.
We believe that this would be extremely useless, costly and inefficient, especially in schools, where children from many linguistic backgrounds have contributed little to facilitating the integration of immigrants into the local communities.
I would also like to highlight the recognition of traditional agriculture, especially organic farming and small-scale farming, which exists in regions with more limited possibilities and represents not only economic enrichment but, above all, environmental enrichment, as it is essential for biodiversity to preserve.
If specifications and allocation of emissions rights are not proportionate, it will be impossible to avoid distortion of competition.

The European Union's presence in Kosovo is gradually being realised by assuming its duties as the United Nations.
The motion for a resolution contains aspects with which we cannot agree, particularly the promotion of a'world carbon emissions trading', given that this solution has already shown that it does not offer the benefit of reducing carbon emissions, but also of creating more public-private partnerships by underlining the'substantial increase in the proportion of public investment', that is, the use of public money to serve private interests and profits.
However, these practical aspects of the agreement with such a large country as Congo create all possible worrying problems.
As far as I am concerned, I think there is only one cancer - human cancer.

I would like to make a few comments on the reports.

Voting time

It is certain that it is possible to help poor regions of the EU and, at the same time, good projects to tackle the problem of climate change, reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy sources and modern technological solutions.
All these elements form a whole that enables us, at least in my view, to produce a coherent response.
I would also like to make a very warm recommendation that the Union should choose to align itself with these different additional protocols that are related to issues such as opposing torture or combating racism, as well as more effective laws.
You have it here.

Furthermore, the EU's common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to the new economic and social climate at local and regional level, which will take into account the increase in energy costs.
I am grateful to have been able to take responsibility and, as a citizen, I am, of course, still responsible for Brandendenburg, who is my home, for a united Germany, a country I love, and for a Europe whose unity will determine our destiny and our future.
The ECR Group welcomes this debate.
The examples given by our colleagues speak for themselves and we can see that Turkey has a very, very long way ahead of it before it meets EU standards.

rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, we have completed the work we started 10 years ago; we are still living memory of the tenacity caused by the disaster that took place in December 1999 and which resulted in a ship of Erika Hitronic, with which Commissioner de Palacio put forward proposals, cooperation, under pressure from public opinion, in at least two parts, in terms of depicting the names of my package and other controls, at the time as well as in June 2002.

Mr President, you have also been able to see the situation for yourselves, but nothing is improving yet, and we are dealing with the collective punishment of innocent people by Israel.
I have not overlooked the fact that there are ERTMS for the rail sector, SESAR and GALILEO, but we do not consider this to be a lack of a user approach on access, on access to reduced mobility, and on the possibility of adapting urban vehicles today in relation to the introduction of energy-efficient urban vehicles, on the matter of users' safety, on the subject of very important information, in particular, on the issue of users' rights and on the use of services, on the Internet.
That is the reality that we can be sure of.

In fact, instead of saying one year after the earthquake, we should say a year of earthquakes, because there was a first seismic earthquake, then an earthquake relating to the irregular distribution of aid, then a health earthquake with a cholera outbreak, then a political earthquake with an untransparent election that probably took place in the worst possible multiple times, and so far to an earthquake which, in some ways, has been fraudulent from an historic standby just as much as a few months.
This means that if the same guidelines, policies and pressures for Portugal and other countries with weaker economies continue to apply, then they will increase even further and we will be in an increasingly serious position due to the lack of solidarity of the European Union.

There are almost one billion illiterate people in the developing world.
We must establish the objective set out in the Treaty of Lisbon: a social market economy that will bring jobs that will bring prosperity and which will bring all our nations a decent standard of living.
Such a view of the representative of the ultraliberal party is not surprising, but it is also a more general problem that the Heads of Government, which have a certain ideological background, are not prepared to take courageous steps calling for visionaries, or to implement measures that could be contrary to their ideological convictions.
We would certainly like to end the time when the concept of stability was used as a successful negotiating resource when the concept of stability was applied in exchange for human rights and the principle of democracy.

To conclude, we believe that the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance is a rational and flexible mechanism for optimising financial assistance for candidate countries and potential candidates.

The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people, the systematic torture in prisons, religious and political repression, execution - all these methods are incompatible with the obligations of the People's Republic of China as a member of the United Nations.

It is very well aware that, unfortunately, it is up to the governments of the Member States to decide on the seats of the institutions and, unfortunately, under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party, John Major, in the Edinburgh Summit in 1992, to set out the legal obligation for the European Parliament to have a year in Strasbourg at 12 part-sessions.

Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with the Act for the Elections of Members of the European Parliament, I declare the opening of the first session of the European Parliament following the elections by direct universal suffrage.
I voted in favour of this report because economic stability could also lead to political stability in this area, which has been particularly turbulent for years.

What is so difficult in asserting that the people of the Middle East should happen?
on behalf of the S & D Group. - Mr President, this debate is on the right point for tourism, for the aviation industry and for consumer protection.

Explanations of vote

SMEs are the driving force behind European economic and producers of sustainable growth, which creates many quality jobs.
Other factors, such as the allocation of the appropriate weight to German as working languages as defined in the treaties, have been neglected.
The longer we have, without an agreement on the TFTP, the greater the risk of a terrorist attack that we could prevent.
Mr President, we are discussing this repeatedly in this House.

It is regrettable that the resolution has come about much later than the position of certain Heads of State and UN officials on the landings of tens of thousands of US troops in the country.
The costs and bureaucracy associated with the wrong multilingualism policy will only increase with further expansion of the EU.
This has not been done.
Perhaps all this seems to be a very remote, but if the brave people of Burma can learn anything from us in this House in Europe, it is that the layer of freedom can never be drowned by a tyranny and that freedom, which is their inalienable right, will certainly be their once again one day.
We must approach this through solidarity with each other, in a coordinated way and not with each other, and with no attempt to spark the other's breathing.
There will be three documents on broadband: firstly, a document on broadband communications that sets out in detail the implementation of the broadband agenda; secondly, the recommendation on new generations (NGA) access, which aims to clarify the basis for promoting investments in high-speed Internet; and thirdly, the first radio spectrum policy programme, which will form the basis for the Commission's broadband strategy.
The aim of this directive is clear enough: we need more authorities for patients and more cooperation between Member States on this matter and in the fight against organ trafficking.
During the process of rescuing the banks, far too little has been done to respond to these predictable developments.
As far as production and employment are concerned, today only a few gaps remain in the medium-/higher, luxury and high-tech sectors.
Confidence is given if the government asks its banks to carry out the stress test over the summer, but only months later, it concluded that it was actually the stress test for the euro and not for the banks.
I welcome with enthusiasm the adoption of this report, given that it deals with promoting research and innovation, which are the driving force behind the current and future growth of the European Union, and gives a voice to the shared feelings of the people most concerned: the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of projects, while strengthening the scientific and technological evaluation process at the same time.
Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes
I believe that the political parties and parliamentary groups that oppose such populism and demagoguery must take a stronger stand against this.
With regard to the subject of the current urgent measures, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the increase in minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems for Member States in a difficult budgetary situation.
(The sitting was closed at 12.50 p.m.)
I would ask you if, in the final remarks, we looked at some very real issues, so that people can understand that they are discussed.
You have just mentioned five points, but the context - the idea that Europe 2020 will also mean addressing economic issues, social issues, environmental issues - is being lost, or at least we would seem to be in danger of losing out.
These are not my words.
So there is now a large majority in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, including the majority of your own people.
So we have to be careful about this.
We must fight and support those who are punished in this way.
I am sorry, it is not possible.
I believe that restrictive measures and sanctions are important instruments of EU policy in the areas of foreign and security policy, as well as, of course, in the issues of legality and protection of fundamental human rights.
The sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises, the basis of our economy.
(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, but I would like to raise an important issue in this respect.
We supported this resolution, with the clear aim of sending out the message that the European Parliament and Labour MEPs are standing by the people of Haiti in their long-term job of restoring the infrastructures, communities and lives that have been destroyed.
Obviously, we are determined to maintain our support for such measures and to continue to deal with this issue in the European Union, not only in the context of preventing violence and supporting victims, but also in the areas of immigration, asylum and criminal justice.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Many EU Member States are jointly responsible when it comes to Guantánamo, for example, as they have granted rights to flights for illegal transport of prisoners.
According to this programme, trade policy remains a very important tool for exploiting opportunities and facing the challenges of globalisation and for stimulating economic growth, jobs and prosperity for all Europe's citizens.
So let us tell us that the obstacles must be removed.
I would also like to add an area that is a cause for concern, namely, the acceptance of produce from non-European Union countries.
Unfortunately, one realises that many measures hide the explicit intention is to conceal the irresponsibility that still exists in our institutions, including the vague identification of the legislative bodies.
I would like to add to this a few political aspects that are important, because Tunisia, as has already been said, is a society that practises a multiparty policy, albeit in limited form, with a quota for the opposition, but nevertheless, no doubt, a multiparty policy.
The appointment of an additional 18 Members of this House is difficult, as some Member States do not have a anticipated procedure at all, and we have concluded that the most important representation is that it should serve as our guiding principle and that this House should gain a balanced representation as soon as possible.
As has already been said here, significant factors for preventing disasters are also the rational exploitation of land, economic and social development, which is coexistence with nature, and enhanced cohesion within the European Union.
I hope that we will be able to improve our trade relations with Japan, and I look forward to further progress in these relations.
The legal texts before us not only define the framework and lay down the main guidelines, but the real, concrete steps still need to be taken.
In addition, I believe that we need to go beyond the proposal to recognise the internal market, for example, by means of green public procurement.
I refer to the importance of the amendment, which highlights the way in which the observer issue must be dealt with, bearing in mind that these observers must be chosen among the main candidates who have not been elected to the European Parliament elections.
Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes
We can talk about 2020, but today we have a more urgent problem: the euro area and Greece.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) represent an important sector, not least because of the importance they hold for the European economy: they make up 7% of the workforce - European labour force - and 6% of GDP, thereby making a vital part of the European economy, and also of the European productive and workforce.
I think we can expect many initiatives to call on the Commission to do more that will require more Europe, and no doubt the Commission will respond with enthusiasm to these requests.
If we do not take responsibility and define ourselves clearly, we can forget what Mrs Toia said earlier: we have to be aware that in 2020 - we have laid down in the Digital Agenda - every European has to be able to deliver its interests through what we call spectrum options.
Such organisations are strengthening their position by responding to people's everyday needs, and then strengthening their power through violence.
Statements by the President

Emerging countries - China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia - are also making national commitments beyond those imposed by scientists.
The protocol provides for the Union's contribution to São Tomé and Príncipe of EUR 682 500 per year, of which EUR 27.500 will support São Tomé and Príncipe fisheries policy, which I believe will be appropriate.
We will see how it is implemented in the future.
And I hope that the Council, too, will take more serious account of what Parliament has done, although I am very sad and very concerned that the Council representative is no longer here.
If we, as Europeans, want to play a more active role in this respect, it is essential that we continue to do so.
This report is a further step towards encouraging the European Council, the Commission and the Member States to take action against homelessness.
For example, in the case of deportation, the family must be able to decide whether it will stay wherever it is or whether it will follow the exiled person.
This terrible agreement was concluded and ratified in the early 1980s with vigour.
Negotiations with Japan, which aim at strengthening trade relations, must not be used as a natural weapon in the service of large financial institutions and companies, which encourage the increasing exploitation of workers and peoples, the destruction of their productive power and the destruction of the environment.
We confirm that everything we have committed ourselves and, as promised in the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary renewal, will be done by the end of this year.

Thus, the initial proposal of the report, which made provision for the implementation of the House of European History, with huge current costs, was entirely at odds with my firm conviction that the budget constraints when the public money is involved.
After all, these investments are not immediately profitable but serve as reserves.
I would also like to emphasise that we can also help other countries, as the previous speaker said.
This directive on cross-border healthcare is essential, although it applies only to 1% of the national health budgets, because we must focus not only on figures but also on the power of symbols, which is the legitimate right of every European to receive treatment abroad and be reimbursed at all relevant information.
However, I call for implementation as a form of primary prevention, of measures to promote healthy lifestyle, as a key factor for improving health.
Due to the different legal arrangements of the Member States and the often limited impact in terms of enforcing the provisions of international law to combat violence, the need for binding regulations at EU level on this problem is becoming increasingly obvious.
What is your opinion on these unintended obligations in the euro system?
Freedom of expression and information, including the freedom to express opinions and the freedom to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure, are social values for which many have fought for years, including in Portugal.

In short, as we have said so many times, we need a cohesion policy that is robust, well-financed and present in all the regions of the European Union.
In principle, some of these fears I share with you, and I also recognise that Turkmenistan still has some way to go in full compliance with international standards of democracy and human rights.
An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with damaging effects on countries that respect workers' rights.
Ladies and gentlemen - and this is addressed, first and foremost, to the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - there is no point in us advocating one or other political group in Ukraine for party reasons.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Mr President, the Arab world is our partner in the Union for the Mediterranean.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom we have very similar views on this programme, and I would also like to congratulate everyone who has worked on this, because at a time of such an economic crisis, it is of paramount importance that we maintain programmes such as this and which have obvious social benefits.
The Commission looks forward to developing a special relationship with Parliament on this dossier as well.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, we must ensure that the promises made at the donors' conference are put into practice in the actual funds and really come to the recipients for which they are intended.

This directive does not accept the principle of protecting migrant workers and protecting those who, because they are forced to work in unacceptable conditions, report.
I am very pleased that we have rejected a draft that was on the agenda only for the left to be able to attack its political opponents in Italy.
You are right in horses.
It is true that there have been intense discussions in the Council on the best ways to ensure that the peripheral Member States do not feel excluded and, ultimately, a qualified majority was created in the Council, but I hope - and I think this has also been demonstrated by this debate - that also in Parliament.
If Amendment 43 is adopted, then Amendment 54 must not be rejected, as it also includes other issues outside the first.

Documents received: see Minutes

We should not be under any illusions: we are talking very clearly, I am speaking to all the leaders very clearly about what needs to happen, with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States.

As we have opened up our markets as we approach the European Union, we are paying the same amount of money in the budget and many other things.

While the EU supports the Copenhagen proposals for further deindustrialisation of the West and the common domination of the Third World, the increasing majority of ordinary people consider climate change to be a deception of the elites - an excuse for us to be even more taxed and supervised, and for the sake of international dogma and the global government to the detriment of the nation state.
In addition, we have regular contacts with third countries, especially with Russia, in order to ask them to lift their ban that we consider to be disproportionate.

At the same time, the consequences of an irresponsible budgetary policy that has functioned so far in several Member States will obviously be persecuted by the European Union for years to come.
The first of these is that science is global discipline, and the progress that we can share is in the direction of increasing the whole human effort.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am shocked by the debate by my fellow Members who, on the one hand, are talking about simplifications for small and medium-sized enterprises, but who, when we should take the first step for micro-entities - and today we are just talking about these, not about other companies - are already prepared to say once again.

(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the extent of interest in this debate by the authors of the question can be seen from the fact that there is not one more in this House, so we have just heard what Inese Vaidere said - that Russia's visa policy was a weapon that it does not use to speed up the process of naturalisation, but rather to achieve the exact opposite.

The EU must evaluate this possibility appropriately in the upcoming dialogue that the High Representative will lead.

Oral questions and written declarations (tabling): see Minutes
Opening of the session
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude.

That is one thing.
Another necessary measure is for India to draw up and implement transparent, clear rules on public procurement, which will also allow European companies to access them.
Thus, by giving a proper impact assessment and defining the different legal options, along with clearly defining the objectives and funding of European infrastructure, it will be easier to achieve long-term strategic projects for building a stronger EU.
Part of this process is the ratification of the new START Treaty, which remains unresolved in the US Congress.

Furthermore, Member States are obliged to ensure that Articles 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is not infringed and that they do not carry out return operations, as the convention obliges Member States to ensure that no person is sent to their country if, in case of return, there is a persecution or a serious attack.
This would make us more effective than if we had opted for an opt-out and allowed the various funds to operate separately.
When drafting legislation at EU level, it is essential to be aware of the particular vulnerability of women and children in relation to domestic violence.

Mrs Ronresults, sit down and stop talking, please.
This is an important fact, which shows Parliament's will and ability to offer itself a candidate for a central role in the CFSP/CSDP, based on the so-called dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon.
For this reason, I support this report in general if Member States retain their important role in managing, drafting and protecting wilderness areas.
Above all, I am going to take away with this long-standing trip for months to come with this Parliament's wish that this service should begin to exist in order to reflect the needs of the voters that you represent and to serve them well.
That concludes this item.
This subject, as well as others, could be addressed at the meeting.
Georgia's territorial integrity cannot be called into question.
So, as you can see, levels are almost the same.
That is why this debate is important to remind you that, in 2009, the Commission made a commitment to present before this House a communication on assessing possible pan-European threats to freedom of expression and pluralism of information, and to draw attention to the importance of drafting a draft directive to ensure pluralism of information in relation to new technologies and, in particular, on television.

This is the Ugandan that we must resolve together.
We need to work with the countries that are the largest consumers, for example, with the US; China, Russia and Japan, and we need to establish a global warning system and the register of illegal logging, and with the countries where it takes place, through Interpol and the relevant UN bodies, using the latest satellite technology systems.

I refer to Commissioner Rehn's statement, which I hold very much appreciate personally, in which he says that Nigeria is a very poor country: it is not true, Nigeria is a very wealthy country, but it is also crushed down by the corrupt and incompetent ruling slogan that plundered the country's resources into the poverty of millions of citizens.
Finally, Mr Mölzer, I would like to say to you that you do not be so pessimistic.

The 2010 budget is creating this systematic approach.
According to the report by the UN Working Group, victims of trafficking are coming from different social environments, from the richest to the poorest, from the most educated to the most unliterate, from the youngest and the elderly.
President-in-Office of the Council. - This is a very important issue.
We need more and better European economic governance for national measures to support all of this, including a financial transaction tax, which I call on the Commission to examine in detail in the European environment as well.
I think that mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States is very important, because this is not just about healthcare, but also about further care, but we have some time to finalise these details.
First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on International Trade for these reports, which deals with important issues in terms of the European Union's contribution to achieving some of the fundamental objectives of public policy: respect for human rights, efforts to achieve economic well-being and social justice, achieve sustainable growth and respect for the environment and, in particular, the climate system.
Consumers will be able, if they buy a product that does not comply with the treaty, to use a number of legal remedies and have the right to claim reimbursement if a legal means are not provided.
Mr President, the reason for this urgent matter is the brutal assassination of 57 people who have followed the policy on his way when the registered office as a candidate in the election for the city of Governor of the province.
This new smart, symmetrical system will lead to stricter supervision, to more thorough assessments by the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Central Bank, and to recommendations on additional reforms and corrective plans.
The Syrian people deserve long-awaited political reforms, particularly with regard to freedom of expression, assembly and political involvement, and governance.
Many of them were British citizens who were trafficked within the United Kingdom and who were not brought from the outside, so to speak.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has once again felt growth in the third quarter of 2009, which is why we could consider the worst behind us.
That is why we expect Greece to adopt a comprehensive programme of structural reforms which will improve the efficiency of public administration, speed up health and pension reform, improve the functioning of the labour market and the effectiveness of the wage negotiations, strengthen the functioning of the market for products, improve the environment for business and maintain the stability of the banking and financial sector.
We believe that the following are still essential when concluding agreements between sovereign states: respect for the sovereignty of a country and its people, a mutual interest, reciprocity and cooperation, taking into account each country's particularities; an evaluation of what each may contribute to the agreement from an economic, social and cultural point of view.
I think that even without the introduction of over-legislative measures, there will be a transition to a sustainable, green economy.
Everyone seems to be forgetting about the contribution of the US and, of course, NATO in bringing about peace in Europe.
I think we should consider this as an appropriate opportunity to address what Europe urgently needs: economic growth, jobs, a dynamic sector of small businesses, more innovation, more effective public procurement - these are the things that our citizens will judge.
I do not think that we are doing our job to announce possible disorders in these countries.
The second project involves concessions.
Madam President, during the European elections in 2004, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, so before restaurants and musicians, we encountered many of the divided constituents.
At a time of profound disappointment at the country's actions, the increase in the EU budget is actually an act of trust in the joint project and in strengthening the measures at supranational level.
I know that this is a good message, so let us go and widen it.
This report contains guidelines for analysing air transport agreements in terms of both content and procedures to be adopted.
The language law is upsetting balance.
It may also be possible in this Chamber to end the debates on British internal policy when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force on 1 December.
This is the difference between the reality of the situation and the inconceivable dreams of the European Parliament.
In addition, we agree that every national parliament must be fully involved in accordance with its budgetary and control rights in order to increase transparency, ownership and responsibility for the decisions taken, including at European level.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, with regard to governance and Europe 2020, five plus two questions have been tabled.
This is why I believe that in promoting SOLVIT, we must actively involve the national authorities, both the European Commission and the Members of this House.
It is a system based on real policies and guidelines and now, Mr Michel, it is also on the major players and liberal rhetoric that have created the current situation: the promotion of a agri-industrial model, consistent with the protection of the interests of the major agri-food industry, and the resulting qualitative phasing-out of the world's agricultural industry; the long-standing investments in the promotion, of small agricultural and medium-sized farming sectors; and of the destruction.
In economic terms: the amount paid to producers is lower than their production costs and the CAP must enable this problem to be resolved.
Once again, I call on the Commission, through its contacts with the government, to always require compliance with this promise so that it is also included in the acquis communautaire.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I fully understand the great interest in this Parliament in the measures being taken in the Union and beyond to address the challenges that some Member States face in the area of their public finances.
We sympathise with the expressions of will of a people who want a better life, empowerment and better tomorrow.
Even the Irish Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) support you.
This new dimension of European foreign policy is the path to follow in order to emerge from the world's more free, fairer and social environment.

You fought for this together, wisdom and orange.
I believe that this procedure, as well as strengthening the security of the EU's public food, introduces greater clarity for the Member States and third countries that export meat products to the EU.
In view of this, it seems unwise to pursue the agreement with Mercosur, as the Swedish food and technology institute has pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35-football times higher than Irish beef.
Therefore, with the agreement with the Council at the end of Article 1 (4), which is Article 1, paragraph 2 (b) of the regulation on amendment, the following text is inserted:'The same exchange rate checks apply to annual price audits regulated by Articles 4b, 4b and 63 (when these prices are indicated in other currencies, not in the euro.'
Today, the Irish Government has requested and rightly received European solidarity.
Just look at Ireland, a country hit particularly hard by the financial crisis: its membership of the monetary union was protected from a crisis that could have an even greater extent.
I believe that the fight against German demands for drought property and, given what I have heard from German politicians on this subject, is quite rightly a fear.
an increase in aid from the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, as well as greater financial support for technical assistance relating to the development and implementation of projects;
If we do not act by convincing countries that they will suffer severe consequences if they implement economically unreasonable policies, we will achieve nothing.

As has always been the case in such complex issues, my shadow team - Bernadette Vergnananai, the Cristian Buşoi and Heide Rühle - has worked well together with me.
In Russia, freedom of the press and of the media is indeed a major problem.
Similarly, it is the responsibility of each Member State to sign or ratify the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which are two main instruments introduced by the Council of Europe.
It is therefore the structured dialogue that gives us the opportunity to exchange views on matters that are worrying for us.
Thirdly, the whole area of sustainability, people who already have work protection and some kind of support to ensure that they do not lose their jobs and then, in the next year or two through the entire training cycle and upskilling in order to get another job; maintaining the existing jobs that exist.
Madam President, we have formulated our questions in order to emphasise the benefits our citizens can expect from such a package of measures and to know what we can contribute to such a package.
I voted in favour of this report because it adds some significant improvements to the European Commission text, particularly with regard to data protection.
In addition, we carried out a review of the funds unspent in 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II can be mobilised.
Thank you very much for your proposal and for a very clear message.
There are some things in it, but also an attempt to take an overall position, which has failed precisely as we had imagined, but which is nevertheless on the right track.
I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank the Commission, which was sometimes somewhat cumbersome, and the Council, in which we tried to find sensible solutions in both night and many trialogue meetings, because they approved the sensible compromise we had reached just one hour ago.
In order to ensure comprehensive and coordinated measures, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, has set up a crisis coordination cell for European aviation after the meeting of the Transport Council on 4 May 2010.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the problem itself, in this case, is illegal logging, few that create the conditions for the trade in illegal timber.
I actually come from a country, Portugal, and the regions, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and very dissident in regions which, in social terms, are quite fragile and where it would actually be necessary to maintain the quota system after 2015 as well.
People are not the product of different cultures; different cultures are the product of different people.
In some cases, these are, in fact, so good that they should be given consideration.
(SV) Mr President, Iceland, with 300 000 inhabitants, is a small country, but in reality it is a great and fantastic nation.
Mr President, MEPs have an important role to play in investigating health claims decisions.
Therefore, on our part, it is a firm'yes' to Nabucco, but it is also our decision to support the efforts of our governments to ensure the well-being of our population through diversification of supply.
We note the ban on political parties, corruption in the justice system, human rights violations, the right of speech and the right of association are seen differently from countries such as Britain and the majority of other European countries.
It is also quite obvious that we need a mix of energy resources on as broad a possible basis, involving many energy sources, which will contribute to stabilising the energy situation and to ensuring the diversification of every nation, and also of the peoples of Europe.
However, I have doubts that this Parliament, in denouncing some repulsive practices, exercises international law, where the legal basis for this is anything but clear.
In voting in favour of this motion for a resolution on Tunisia, I clearly express my support for the Tunisian people and for the historic democratic revolution that has begun.
It also calls on the Member States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies, such as national action plans or targeted social measures, in order to reduce energy poverty, and to report regularly on their measures to resolve this problem.
If a law and a decree are passed in the Hungarian Parliament, so that it can only be modified from now on by a two-thirds majority, you are aware that it will not be easy to change it after the next elections.
General tariff preferences (debate)
Today, we voted in plenary on the recommendation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.
However, the new sense of mutual trust opens up another major problem.
This year, we have allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS, but the real costs will be possible to assess after the first year of operation, when a report on the joint spending in the work of the EEAS is submitted to the European Parliament.
My question concerns Pakistan, whose chronic instability is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis of both the region and Afghanistan as a whole.
Of course, we cannot ignore the natural biological differences between men and women.
We must not forget these factors, including when it comes to the idea in the proposal to earmark revenue from infrastructure charges.
(HU) Mr President, in this directive, I welcome the clearer definition of patients' rights, the end of endless waiting lists and the proposed solution as an exit in a case where experts are not available in a home country.
Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, I would like to make a few comments on the matters and issues that have been raised.
Last week, in committee, I accused the Belgian Presidency of being a ghost Presidency.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran as I am concerned about the continuation of human rights violations there, particularly in view of the right of association, expression and information, and because I support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people.
Above all, it will be very important to finance the speedy start.
One thing is to create such a mechanism, but it must also be accessible and comprehensible to EU citizens in order to make full use of it.
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive, but also make them safer, as regulators and law enforcement authorities will work more closely together on all matters relating to certification, inspection and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights.
I do not know whether the European Parliament can take part in the fundamental debate on the European Arrest Warrant.
However, its private aspect not only strengthens the image that Europe represents to the world, but also promotes European citizenship.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today aims to amend the regulation adopted in 2004, which improved and harmonised the safety rules relating to the protection of passports and travel documents against abuse, while introducing elements of biometric identification.
Secondly, we need to establish a kind of temporary institutional framework for the mechanisms for imposing decisions.
Having said that, from a more recent point of view, some of the agreements that we have recently concluded, such as the free trade agreement with Korea, are very good.
It is therefore important for Parliament to remind the Commission once again of the social clause contained in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade will realise that the current approach of constructive cooperation with the European Union is much more effective than the constant efforts to rewrite history.
It is strange, however, that the European Commission has not found the necessary arguments, nor has it found the time, to influence the Latvian Government, to end discrimination on the grounds of language.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to step up any form of assistance to the Pakistani Government by urgently lifting this harmful discrimination against religious minorities in the country.
It will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and human trafficking.
That is acceptable and legitimate, and that is what we have fought for.
Today, more than ever, it is clear that financial institutions should be preoccupied by their actions.
Our common aim is to reduce catches and discards as much as possible, and that is what we have achieved in committee.
The main purpose of trade assistance is to strengthen the domestic and international competitiveness of 48 countries.
Even if we accept the reflection on internalising external costs as a starting point, it is unacceptable to punish only heavy goods vehicles and not ordinary cars in order to reduce traffic congestion, just as the old'polluter pays' principle is applied in a clear discriminatory way.
I am encouraged by the understanding and support I receive in this plenary debate.
In addition, we also have some concerns on the starting point of the road.
The primary objective of the European Union and of the governments of its Member States, whether the centre right or the centre left, is to defend the continued profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union.
It is therefore necessary to adopt measures aimed at disseminating good practices and raising awareness of the benefits offered by ICTs among local decision makers.
Mr President, we have not heard an English interpretation of the previous speech.
However, there is a very important aspect of this recast, this codified text, which concerns the whole reform of the TEN-T networks over the next decade.
Mr President, Parliament's compromise resolution on Ukraine is crucial for the people of Ukraine, but we must not forget that it is also very important for the people of the European Union, because Ukraine is our important partner, particularly in implementing the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) with Eastern Europe.
Therefore, the Commission must have a strong impact.
We cannot interfere in what lies exclusively with the United States Government of America.
People governing our forests receive little or nothing because they provide hidden functions that many take for granted.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that the list of unresolved problems is becoming longer, not shorter.
With regard to Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy on relations with Latin America, I would like to ask both the Council and the Commission, which Baroness Ashton is now presenting, to take urgent action on three issues.
There are large retailers who have a strong market presence in some Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are more satisfied with what we are currently proposing than with what has been in force since 2002, because they have seen that certain aspects, which were not the intention of the legislator in 2002, were not in their interests, but rather made it difficult for them to combat the assertions of competition that the large retailers represent.
It must establish the'Regional Political Partnership of the EU for Peace, Security and Development in the Horn of Africa', created by the Committee on Development in April 2007.
In those years, particularly after the historic enlargement of 2004, the circumstances and ambitions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) have changed considerably.
Spain is taking on the baton of the Presidency of the European Union just as the Treaty of Lisbon was in place.
In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already set out in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda, and that it is one of the priority actions of the Single Market Act.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) I should like to give my emphatic support to Mr Swoboda's proposal.
The Commission draft was amended in accordance with the report that we are now voting on and with the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is therefore important to reach an agreement at first reading.
These are the people who need help most and must not be excluded because of their location.
The entire medical assistance, regardless of its distinctive characteristics, falls within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
However, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that a recent study by the European Union for cardiology has demonstrated once again that this methodology is quite limited to the low participation of women in such tests.
It is not our intention to use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, nor should we be prevented from achieving social and environmental objectives.
I would ask, in particular, that in this largely agricultural area, a greater focus be placed on the recovery of organic waste, that the deadline set for exchanging best practices be verified.
It is a perfectly incomprehensible legal provision according to which the Orthodox priests, chicken and patriots of Turkish citizens must be.
The most important point in the context of this position, which has been adopted by Parliament, is the attention paid to the unbundling of measures that are therefore potentially incompatible, not only as legislation, but especially in terms of their implementation.
(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has secured the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
At least the subject of the single digital market, it has been a priority for the EU.
This would be an important step forward in the direction of the transparency, openness and clarity of the European process.
(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and the debate on this matter makes perfect sense.
It is a model of economic development that Europe is supposed to propose for Europeans?
I usually do not allow ordinary speakers to exceed the allocated time, but I think we all agree that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important to us.
We want appropriate strategies based on new technologies, innovation and investment, a strategy which, once implemented, will significantly improve the quality of life of all European citizens in the Danube region.
It is a major achievement, although this directive, without addressing the legal basis, recognises the unquestionable rights of patients and opens up new possibilities for accessing better treatment.
Year after year, the Court of Auditors was unable to reassure us that the EU budget was used legally and correctly, and I was really worried about the lack of control over taxpayers' money when I was the main accountant of the European Commission in 2002.
This, for me, is a huge challenge and a great honour.
To be honest, we must acknowledge our historic responsibility for climate change and our per capita emissions are still much higher than those in China or India, for example.
I am sure that dialogue will be constructive on this basis.
We therefore regret that, as with Europol, haste has prevailed over the desire to protect fundamental freedoms.
I agree with the Commission's proposal, which aims to introduce an additional, simpler method of using the reserves of the European Social Fund to provide a quicker and more effective response to the economic and social difficulties that Europe is facing.
Frankly, I should actually vote against the composition of the Commission, but there are also some very good candidates in it - including the Polish candidate, Januszwanu Ledowski.
President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but, alongside Britain, there are, in fact, 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that while we are very sensitive to the concerns that you have expressed, I must also listen to other legitimate concerns.
I believe that we need to maintain carefully the neutrality of the EU's humanitarian response, even though this is sometimes difficult in crisis areas.
In addition, it adds new facts to what Parliament has already said in the past, such as the call on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the Commission to assess the results of investigations carried out by all parties and to report back to Parliament, to point out that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States require comprehensive monitoring and to express the concerns about the pressure from the non-governmental organisations, including the reference to the follow-up to the Goldstone report.
I also hope that this decision will help to resolve the disappearance of fish species.
I hope that my question will not be seen as a challenge, but as a reminder of thinking.
I am always prepared - and I hope also able - to go back and clarify our results, but we must endorse what we find ourselves.
This result will strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the talks on international trade, especially in the World Trade Organisation's ongoing negotiations.
When Europe speaks with one voice, the United States will have to adopt the same goal.
That is why I personally support the prices set out for European tobacco growers, at least as long as the people of Europe smoke.
If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries take this problem more seriously than others.
I would therefore like the European Social Fund (ESF) to be independent and separate from European structural policy.
The number of infections continues to exceed the spread of treatment, and two thirds of people who needed treatment in 2009 have not yet received it, meaning that the 10 million people who need access to the necessary effective treatment have not had that.
Indeed, when the dignity of every person is respected, we no longer view any minority negatively.
I welcome the Commission's proposals to simplify this fund.
In future, all the EU institutions should ensure that our budgets are targeted at helping individuals and businesses who are going through difficult economic times and are planning their recovery.
The fastest way to curb themselves entirely is to have much more practical and efficient than any actions from above down is to support civil initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions.
I would say to all those who are still struggling against this treaty today in the mistaken belief that it is a Treaty that strengthens the European Union: those who are fighting this Treaty are actually strengthening our so-called partners or, if you like, our opponents.
The European Union has adopted global capitalism, which will suffice us all.
We will soon have a TEN-T meeting where the Commission will work towards developing a network of other modes of transport.

The first person who asked to take the floor this morning was Mr Madlener.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community.

I would like to remind the House that, according to a recent inception, there are still 20 million unemployed in the European Union - the figure is now likely to increase to 25 million - meaning that the attraction of yet more asylum seekers is a kind of group suicide.
Sanctions must be imposed by the Commission, not by the finance ministers.
Sri Lanka, in its economic recovery, depends on the EU's foreign direct investment and economic support.

This document is the result of a compromise after long negotiations, which highlights the implementation of passenger rights without imposing additional burdens on carriers.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union has been working for 10 years to create legal instruments in the field of economic immigration.
The Stihler report is a valuable tool for removing the national administrative and technical barriers preventing construction products from marketing in the European Union and for further building the single market in the sector.
If we really want to achieve the goals set out by our foreign policy in the Treaties, I am sure we still have a lot to do before we can start returning illegal immigrants from the EU to Libya.
That is why I voted for the resolution on the European Innovation Partnerships within the framework of the Innovation Union flagship initiative, and I think we should all get involved in innovation work because, as I said, this is very important for the future.
In the UK, we have a newly elected government that has made promises in this area.
The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -.
The economic crisis and environmental policy can go hand in hand and bring us positive results, both in the environment and in the creation of new jobs.
Some Member States do not use all of the European Structural Funds and leave 30 or 40% unused.
In fact, I ask myself - even if the Commission said that it had information and that it publicises it, that it is mandatory to publish it - why it was then unknown, for example.
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I firmly support the proposal to conduct an effective information campaign in order to improve the visibility of the points of single contact.
I find it rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling on us to tackle the economic crisis and to make sure that the implementation of economic policy objectives is mandatory.
Today, I voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation on unitary patent protection, because I do not think it is justified to circumvent the matter in the Council because of the language arrangements.

I would like to remind you of the joint agreement of the European Parliament and the Council that 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
Let me assure Parliament that we will continue to address these issues at the highest level and remind the People's Republic of China of human rights international obligations.
I hope - and I am sure - that your votes will form the basis for this agreement.
Firstly, I regret that my colleague, Mr McCreevy, is absent from the Commissioners here - I think perhaps the season of the Congolese Tunds has just reopened!
You may not be aware of this, but there is a need, for example, for extensive animal testing in order to check such claims.
However, I have some misgivings, Commissioner, about the fact that, in the process that we are starting here, the CARS 21 and the industry alone have a considerable impact.
We do not agree with this.
The EU aid planned for 2007-2010, intended to support the development of democracy and good governance in Moldova, amounts to more than 50 million euros.
Indeed, we cannot understand how an unlawful worker can accept his job and he is a person who accepts to cover his residence and livelihood, ultimately punished.
I believe that this measuring system, based on the approval of the different parameters of research, will lead to political decisions that will be more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.
At the same time, I would like to stress the need to make the deepening of the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus conditional and directly link the elimination of restrictions on freedom and ending violence against participants in peaceful demonstrations and against human rights defenders.
Finally, Madam High Representative, you will travel to the Middle East.
Worse still, the US Congress has even adopted a law to protect members of its forces only a month after the Court of Justice was established in July 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain very briefly that this report includes amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which were adopted in plenary on 19 June 2008, rejecting the Commission proposal aimed at allowing the sale of poultrymeat for human consumption, even when it was antimicrobial.
Madam President, first of all, I would also like to express my deep sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and the deepest concern for the fate of four other Cuban prisoners and one political activist who also began a hunger strike from the protest.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the multiannual programme 2010-2014 on the area of freedom, security and justice (Stockholm Programme).
Our motto should be that we should not lose a single cent.
The Union and, in particular, the Mediterranean countries, have always been at the forefront of providing humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi people, because the principle of solidarity with the people living in such problematic circumstances is fundamental.
Often, workers themselves have been isolated, and access to trade unions is very difficult in this situation.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank both Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today.
However, despite some of the amendments that have helped to improve it, the report by Mrs Guillaume is a real incentive to abuse this procedure by overloading the relevant services, thereby depriving those cases where we should really look quickly.
We now have a responsibility to do everything in our power, but I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work, which is well-being for us all.
We have completed a really huge programme with some important reports.

The Commission and the Council must step up their efforts to ensure that human rights are respected in the Republic of Congo.
(EL) Madam President, with regard to what the Commissioner said about evaluating every proposal, I should like to ask whether a preliminary study can be carried out into the area in question on the basis of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and the specific characteristics of this area, or whether there are criteria that each country will have to follow from the outset and meet during its programming.
We also need to address the issue of Roma women facing particular problems of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence; there is a particular problem with young Roma people, because their lack of skills in these times of economic crisis makes it even more difficult for them to have access to employment.
I am pleased to vote in favour of this amendment to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to extend the scope of its action in the area of housing in favour of marginalised communities in all Member States.
At the same time, it is also a reminder for all policy makers in their spheres of competence that public authorities really must play their part if effective freedom of the press is to be achieved: they must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and promote its development.
Mr President, I think the European Union has become far too big, there is far too much cultures in it, and I simply do not trust the system in the very least, and that will exacerbate it.
It is too early to announce the results of this analysis, as the honourable Member is probably aware that the unanimity of the Council is required for every step in this process.
It is important to bear in mind that they serve the prospect of integration with the EU as the greatest stimulus for the Balkan countries to embark on the necessary reforms, and also as a factor for regional stability.
Now that advertising has an even greater role, it is essential to lay down criteria that enable consumers and patients to have full awareness and certainty regarding the types of effects that these medicines have.
According to Neil Armstrong, this would be a small step for the European funds, but a major leap for the European economy.
Thirdly, there are simply no security gaps which people constantly claim will be created if we do not support the interim agreement.
Furthermore, the rapid dissemination of the Internet and e-commerce in recent years has affected the increase in online gambling supply and the resulting emergence of cross-border issues that remain unresolved.
All those who take decisions in this area should have equal access to professional information about the country of origin and the bodies authorised to deal with applications, and the same should apply to the people who request asylum.
Therefore, after all these years, I appreciate how important a step it represented the creation of the only multinational parliament in the world that was elected by universal suffrage.
26 Member States of the European Union are spending EUR 200 billion per year, and these 200 billion must be spent today on a higher quality than in the past.
