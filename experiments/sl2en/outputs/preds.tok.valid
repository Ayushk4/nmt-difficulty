Closure of sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions from the report discussed by the European Parliament on Wednesday remind us that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much more adverse impact on the environment than internal production , which is subject to stricter rules on reducing carbon dioxide emissions which contribute to climate change .
In fact , it is difficult to accept the fact that the recipient countries are unable to use these funds .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
Maritime institutions in the Member States must work much more closely together in order to coordinate their training programmes and also offer opportunities for paid jobs and exchanges of experiences with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
We note that we are increasingly demanding more and more of our farmers .
We need to strengthen Frontex and the EU needs to put pressure on the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
I would also like to add something that no one has yet mentioned , with the exception of Commissioner Almunia .
The areas sensitive to the effects of climate change are mainly as follows : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity and , last but not least , the health of the population .
Allow me , both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission , to express my regret at the death of nine Turkish soldiers and weapons of a terrorist attack last week .
Mr Piebalgs , I congratulate you on all that you are doing .
However , it is reassuring that , in the face of opposition and the concerns expressed by members of the Committee on Culture and Education on the reduction in the importance of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is rising and causing problems in many European Union Member States , the necessary amendments that I supported and have increased the appropriations initially planned for Article 1502 on lifelong learning programmes ) .
Then he took power as a minority government with totally different political beliefs , but nobody saw this as a coup d &apos;état .
The fact that we , the international community , have been watching , while the issue of Abyei remained unresolved in a referendum is , in fact , a very irresponsible and recipe for the future restart of the war .
The case of the Romanian Red Cozme , who was brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian community , proves once again that crime knows no borders and that ignoring this community &apos;s problems is having harmful consequences .
There needs to be a strong EU food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon sets a new political example in Europe , both in terms of the need to combine resources for the Member States in order to achieve optimum results , and of cooperation in common strategies and operations , which will also help Europe to become a political union to which its founders drew a long years ago .
That is our request .
We all support the Single Market , which Hungary has supported since the beginning .
Inevitably climate change is forcing society and the economy of the European Union to adapt to the new reality .
Individual states will continue to promote internal stability and will help to find social and economic solutions and to remedy ethnic tensions .
It is a fantastic three-year birth and , as in the case of any short deadlines , I am pleased that it is coming to an end .
The need for NATO to maintain constant vigilance and to have support , and now , particularly in Afghanistan , is essential .
However , something will have to happen and we will have to start moving things forward .
In this respect , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , exceptions , the possibility of setting the highest level and , last but not least , the place of taxation of supplies within the EU , will have to be addressed .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the highest youth unemployment and our automotive industry has been decimated , partly because of the funding of jobs in Slovakia by the European Union , which has taken off essential jobs of the Ryton plant .
It is essential to ensure that these young institutions are not forced to celebrate or undermine the key rules for reforming the financial sector .
Enough is enough .
We should also accelerate the creation of a network of research centres which can divide specialised infrastructures and exchange useful information and data .
Qimonda fulfils the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of creating a European Asylum Support Office , because the situation in third countries , particularly Africa and the Middle East , is continuing to deteriorate .
Mr Severin has looked very closely at the strategic reciprocity that Europe needs a strong United States , and the US needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this wave of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion of it can integrate into the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that the Canadian authorities will do their utmost in the near future to lift visa requirements .
Ultimately , it was not the food inspector or the EU food safety agency that had come to this discovery , but only the companies themselves .
Belarus ( debate )
Therefore , we should also use our military capacities , with an emphasis on soft power and prevention , to open up new points on the agenda , which otherwise existed before , but which were clearly formulated in Munich , as President Obama &apos;s policy allows us to enter the new era of the disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to be able to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been drawn up by the Committee on Budgets some time ago .
In September , members of the MoDem party voted against the appointment of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission , as his past work does not speak in favour of re-election .
By restructuring our agricultural policy , we can ensure that animal welfare is the focus , that animals live in a situation that is suitable for animals , and that animals are strong and strong , based on the principle that it is better prevented than cure .
We are now afraid that if the scope of this directive is extended , the directive will suffer the same fate as the last attempt to introduce the &apos; Made in in &apos; origin mark - in other words , that the Council will reblock it .
( SL ) I would like to join with my colleagues in suggesting that the policy , the Member States and the European Union think , first of all , of all , about small and medium-sized enterprises in the recovery measures .
Activities such as the United Kingdom and the US , both by exceeding their deficits by 10 % , will have to make large adjustments to restore the sustainability of their public finances .
We need to separate things , or will Prime Minister Leterme have to comment on a new media law in Hungary , and I am sure that is not his duty .
Obviously , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Apart from being an insult to wine growers , particularly to Provansa , which has pursued quality policy , it would also be unacceptable for us to legislate on the by-product that comes up with the blending of finished products and allow misleading references to rosé colour .
However , we need to do much more .
What happens is that jobs will be lost in rural Europe and our food production capacity will be reduced .
Let us also remember that , despite these institutional matters , the Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is having a huge impact on the need to move on climate change , the need to move on the financial crisis , the concern in Europe is that we need a policy to create jobs - many important matters to be addressed .
However , let me stress that we know full well that many of the texts needed for police and judicial cooperation will require a new basis to enable Parliament to perform its function as a colegislator .
I also congratulate the rapporteurs for having released the ethical element , which will , of course , fall under the competence of the Member States .
This is a good thing , because , after all , it is young people who will decide the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we must not forget those who have already made a significant contribution to building Europe .
In other words , we are creating an economic recovery plan in which we are giving three and a half billion worth of the energy giants &apos; oligarchies and not a penny to partners whose help to impose changes for the conversion to green energy .
Fishing quotas and the management of stocks are fundamental to avoiding total overfishing in inland waters and oceans .
We would prefer Parliament &apos;s resources to be increased by means of redistribution and measures to increase efficiency , not by increasing the common budget .
Furthermore , this package could show how European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , effective and constructive way in such an important area .
I am convinced that transferring funds to an early stage , as advocated by the Commission in its proposal for a recast , will enable us , in other words , to take advantage of the economic scope &apos;s original stages in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have produced a good report and we have managed to reach a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to extract European business from countries where the level of environmental requirements does not reach our grasp .
All the contributions have been helpful .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is obviously getting worse .
They need to work hard to achieve an agreement between the 27 Member States that reflects Europe &apos;s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and I thank Mrs Andrikienfor an excellent report .
Tourism is , without doubt , one of the economic sectors with the most important development potential .
At that time , money was earmarked for two types of projects aimed at reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions , i.e. carbon capture and storage and wind power plants in the North Sea .
If we were proposed that money from the EGF be allocated to workers made redundant in Britain , we would be voting in favour and we would be criticised if we did not .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the Court is fully working , but it is still in its infancy .
This partnership covers our neighbours and involves our immediate neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as more remote ones , such as Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Along with my colleagues in the Commission , we are working very hard to ensure that gender mainstreaming is integrated into all the policies that we are going to present .
These projects will help to overcome the differences between the links between systems in the European Union and will make it possible to make even more optimistic use of the European Union &apos;s energy resources secular .
Moreover , this approach is based on politics and I think that Europe needs more policy than anything , which is certainly one of the duties of our Parliament .
There is also the failure of the International football Alliance to introduce pull technology , while other sports have already done so .
We can organise a wide range of training courses and workshops that can provide real help in accessing EU funds for rural development .
Others use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral arrangements with suppliers , which often do not respect the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
In addition , we welcome the fact that we have also succeeded in creating a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the drafting of legislative programmes .
In particular , the Member States have made significant efforts to achieve their commitments on the pact .
The aim is for the EU to respond to the major social challenges affecting all Member States , to which it cannot rise ( ageing population and health , energy supply , water and food , sustainable development , the fight against climate change , etc . ) , and to developing knowledge that will enable our businesses to be more innovative and increase their competitiveness .
Although tomorrow we will support the resolution , I think there are some inconsistencies in the budget , and I would like to point out two of the most important ones .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will move forward on the issues of governance for the global economy , particularly with regard to financial regulation and timely measures following the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to talk a little bit more about this issue .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was set up in 2006 to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns in order to assist them in their reintegration into the labour market .
The basic question lies in the fact that Europeans do not want to accept the consequences of freedom of establishment , which would inevitably come out of accession .
This is an unthankful , difficult role .
This is exactly at the top of our list of priorities .
However , EU support is essential for ensuring the independence of that country .
The Israeli Government is progressively continuing colonialisation , and this following the perpetration of war crimes at the beginning of this year .
The assessments and additional visits by teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready for full membership of the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal still has five surface long-liners , as before .
an increase in budget resources for these areas and for the establishment of new military capabilities , which will lead to a new arms race ,
I would also like to emphasise the contrast between the commitment of the Pakistani Government to religious freedom and its leadership in the organisation of Islamic countries in support of the United Nations &apos; fight against the defamation of religion &apos; agenda .
This afternoon , I stress this because it is my honest opinion .
I think that the compromise reached by the Council is a good one , as it guarantees equal rights and equal treatment .
In this context , the rapid and coordinated intervention of European governments and institutions is an absolute necessity , as is the introduction of returns programmes to old cars , the value of which returns to the purchasing price of the new car , financial aid and similar measures .
I believe that the legal basis proposed is correct , but it does not seem any more consistent than the important entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon when the functions and powers that are currently shared between the two pillars are consolidated .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure , this is now an issue &apos; .
Such a policy is doomed to failure if people working in the fishing industry do not comply with the rules of the fishermen and the traders selling fish to consumers .
This wasteful , inefficient talk in Parliament , the mass that gives us a painful picture of a responsible democracy , the terrible deception of the voters who sent us seed .
This is regrettable because it seems that we should be united on this issue .
We no longer say that trade liberalisation and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industry in Europe , where we care in some way , because climate change must take priority .
The debt burden - the painful proof of which we have witnessed - is an obstacle to economic growth , not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
In addition , this report will help clarify the various air agreements and process them in a more appealing way , and also indicate which criteria we need to pay attention and what aspects we need to monitor .
I will vote in favour of the telecoms package , but I am going to do so in some way negligence , because I believe that , as a matter of principle , this is the issuing of the basic principle of liberalising telecommunications that this directive is to achieve at the highest level .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing a crisis that has so far been lacking .
The measures will be more successful and will cost taxpayers less if we are able to coordinate our efforts with each other .
The European Commission is working on a directive that will make it easier for Belarus to obtain a visa for the EU , and on a readmission agreement .
Let me give an example .
Let us look , for example , at bringing up children and schools .
We also do not know whether the standards we support in the area of legal trade in timber will be accepted and whether they will work at global level - some speakers have already pointed out this problem .
Establishing the Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis as an authority for examining and assessing the coordination of measures taken by Member States to support sustainable quality growth is essential .
in writing . - I supported the amendment to the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to make it possible to use more effective vaccines and reduce bureaucratic procedures for farmers .
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for the establishment of strong , united EU policies .
By abstaining , I would like to express my deep disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which was much below the expectations of the citizens .
Late payments often cause problems both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
We certainly need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , no one denies this , but we must not insist that citizens are struggling , because they are our only opportunity to emerge from the crisis .
To this end , they have an early warning system in the United States .
One of these cases is my constituent , Andrew Symeou .
We must defend our rights , freedoms and democracy together .
Put things right : that is what Europeans have asked for by voting in this House , and that is what we have to guarantee them if they are to be held in five years &apos; time by voting for more .
Part of the wordings that the European Council is responsible for and endorsed by the European Council itself .
The private expenditure on a person &apos;s final consumption has increased by more than 80 % over the last decade .
At the moment , I think it is useful to actively consider ways in which existing legislation is implemented properly .
The conclusions of the summit in this respect are very vague .
To this end , it offers a proposal for uniform instruments to allow the implementation or insurance of measures in order to prevent problems in recognising and translating instruments originating in other Member States and in the standard formula on the manual of documents for applications in another Member State &apos;s territory .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because important policy areas and individual opinions have been taken into account .
The Commission can support Member States through financial cooperation programmes at European level .
The Council &apos;s conclusions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 established the power of the Member States to cooperate at national , intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes , which , thankfully - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - even form part of the legislation in some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not also be seen as support for the &apos; subsidy gold &apos; of the EU .
Hopes have been made more and more frequently and the Internet has now completely changed our habits , partly because our lives are becoming increasingly cold .
As far as information is concerned , I can say that we are providing continuous information when we receive it .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment in the education of the young generation is , and I am thinking of lifelong education .
We want the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am delighted that these issues have been resolved satisfactorily in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the left )
Thousands of people have been damaged in this case , often with small children and with no adequate financial means .
Procedures are totally different when it comes to reversing the Commission on the basis of the provisions of the future Treaty and the title of Parliament through the procedure for tabling petitions .
All parties in the Middle East conflict must respect human rights .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece asked questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We must face up to our responsibilities .
We know that UNESCO has prepared the presentation to the Chinese authorities of its impact on the traditional heritage and culture of Kashgar .
in writing . - MEP has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety by introducing stricter safety requirements for car manufacturers .
For this reason , I have voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown the ability to act and have strengthened our resistance .
If we are going to discuss Parliament &apos;s position with the external bodies , for example , with human rights organisations that could be affected by this , and if we do not reach an agreement , although I hope that this does not happen , and if the individual projects cannot be implemented , I believe that these Parliament &apos;s position will support and understand .
These Thursday afternoon &apos;s sessions are becoming increasingly surrealistic , both because of their considerable empty and because of the way they are dealt with and how they are dealt with .
I am convinced that it is still completely unclear whether Moldova will manage to elect its President and , if this does not happen , the country will obviously have new elections next year .
in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began operating on 1 January 1999 and , at the same time , 11 EU Member States adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I too should like to endorse and welcome the current compromise , because it raises the issue of the democratic deficits that women have had to cope with for years by helping their dealings , domestic crafts , small and medium-sized enterprises and the free professions where their work has not been recognised for years .
Of course , our political decisions have shown themselves in different ways and have sometimes been contradictory .
I would say that to climate justice because it is the relationship between developing countries and the developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for financing mitigation and adaptation measures , and a way of showing our willingness to take a leading role .
I would therefore also like to know what the Commission &apos;s position is on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to banks which have benefited from this aid , but did not take the appropriate social approach .
Not only do I have three children , I also have an grandchildren who are currently writing milk .
We are prepared to draw up technical assistance programmes that will accompany the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities have to introduce .
I am waiting for the Commission to come up with a strategy .
As you say , we need to constantly update our statistics , and Eurostat is looking into it .
I sometimes wonder if we have not learned enough about the consequences of our actions unless we follow European solutions to European problems and try to find something specific , even though we have to deal with it together .
Electronic monsters also reveal that scientists who have been sceptical about this hypothesis have been expelled from technical scientific processes in order to avoid public error in research .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
The Internet perhaps shed light on this very thorny part of society , with which we are still seriously dealing , and this is a very bad thing .
We know what type of people we are dealing with , so institutions need to be aware that they pose a greater risk of inspection and therefore need to be subject to stricter inspections .
In revising the RoHS Directive , we have paid attention to improving the safety standards for electrical and electronic devices which are in sale in the European Union .
Preventive work is carried out mainly in schools , as this social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependence .
It has successfully increased that it reunites the continent at the end of the Cold War , and it is now called on to preserve previous achievements and to continue integration once the better times have come .
Many Members would like us to have answers to our questions this evening and out of respect for them , we would like to implement it in a regular manner .
But those of us who have been involved know that there was no alternative to this sector &apos;s problems , that we hope we are now on the way to resolve some of the problems that this sector has encountered .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provision , we have decided to refrain from such reference in this report , because we oppose any kind of family policy that is predicted at EU level by national governments .
Last but not least , I believe that in the forthcoming talks on this subject , we will also have to deal with the EUBAM Rafah case : how to revive this mission and how we can extend it .
So the Commission is monitoring the situation and will act if necessary , but I do not think we should go beyond the place of Community law , and the Commission will certainly remain within Community law .
Since we all want to have a real European diplomatic service together , which will not only be an extension to the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we are going to debate today are of fundamental importance , but which will vote tomorrow .
in writing . - In the light of the undiminished gaps between men and women in terms of employment rates , salaries and access to managerial positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC and , at the same time , to ensure that its provisions are transposed fully and effectively into national legislation .
I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
Indeed , I would like to try to reassure the Commissioner that there will be no further negotiations over the next few weeks if the blows are not extradited .
We will soon discuss this issue in the discussions on the recast of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , on Wednesday , 20 October , the European Parliament adopted the report of its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already talk of raising taxes in the near future so that public finances do not pour into debt .
Today is the time to speak out against the right to practise religion freely for Christians and members of other religions .
In the EU , 31.5 % of employed women are part-time ( 30 hours or less per week ) compared to only 8.3 % of men .
I , too , am cautious , as does the Commissioner and the Deputy Prime Minister , and it seems to me that there will be vague , but there are still a lot of clouds .
At the time , it is rare for us to know what scale the imminent economic crisis will have .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction when it shows itself to be on the side of the consumer .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
This policy has become a key feature of the economic recovery package , which provides added value and supports efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , while demonstrating European solidarity .
It is also unfortunate that we still do not know if and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , but we certainly need to adopt it without further delay .
However , I think that the event clearly shows how bad the agriculture is , particularly in my own county , if farmers have to wait in line , in the winter cold in order to provide themselves with modest resources out of EU aid .
Southern European countries waited until it was too late .
This must be done by achieving smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will express our will through a democratic vote , so it is a very important day tomorrow .
It should be said that the provision of housing is an urgent need for everyone , especially in a modern state of prosperity .
In my opinion , prioritising as political resources should be set out under a small , transparent and democratic perspective .
This project is dealing with the installation of the traffic management system .
( HU ) In recent months , in Vojvodina in northern Serbia , fear has once again been distracted by the multiple nationalities living there , mainly among Hungarians .
Today , we will vote on the outcome of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I know that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved a result in our name that is practical and feasible .
in writing . - We agree with parts of the proposal that govern equal treatment of Parliament and the Council as regards participation in meetings and access to information , regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament , cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives , assessment of the impact of legislation and application of &apos; soft law &apos; ( rather than criminal law ) , we oppose : the reintroduction and tightening of compulsory deadlines for implementing directives and the use of languages in relation to the European Union and its officials .
You all know that there can be no broadcasting without access to the radio spectrum , and the EU wants to ensure , through its policy , that all market players have non-discriminatory access to the radio spectrum .
This will provide us with a general and fairly comprehensive framework for the action of the Commission on equality between men and women in the areas just mentioned by the Member , from employment right up to other matters where it is important to ensure and guarantee such equality .
We look forward to seeing other political and economic powers submitting their offers as well , as so many of them have not done .
Dementia and , in particular , Alzheimer &apos;s disease , are not only a serious health problem , but also a huge , sensitive ethical and social problem , the insecurity of which will continue to increase as the European population ages .
I would also like to state that you have pointed out very carefully that we should not confuse different responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to mix the responsibilities of the Member States with the responsibilities of the European Union .
rapporteur . - Mr President , let me start by thanking my shadow rapporteurs , who have tackled in detail this question : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have given them our hand and , with the full support of the European institutions , I am asking Minsk to adopt it , because this will bring great benefits to you and to the people of Belarus .
We must watch closely the developments , because the President has said that the annual savings of European companies will be EUR 38 billion .
Now , following the judgment against Liu Xiaobo , we have seen the police ban on a homosexual party , which clearly threatens to cause a political iceberty for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your message to Ukraine today has been clear .
We must be aware that this can only take place with the involvement of parliaments , because only the majority of the regulations can be adjusted properly in the parliaments , and that this process and the proposals concerning the Transatlantic Legislators &apos; Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are extremely important .
One of the speakers mentioned helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am very pleased to see and hear you here .
I would like to emphasise this in this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who help their self-employed people .
Anyone who was following the Gaza conflict can bear in mind the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , the relationship with the United States is , strategically speaking , the most important relationship of the European Union .
Let me say that my ambition is to reach a political consensus at the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do any more and do better , with less money .
I am encouraged by the large number of participants at the Copenhagen meeting that the cooperation of such a large number of allies will , in the end , lead to success .
Mr President , I would like to speak in support of the motion not to finish with a resolution , because I have heard Mr Schulz say something that I think is very important : if we really want this debate to cover &apos; Europe &apos; and not just Italy , then there is no point in voting on the resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of Information in Italy &apos; .
That is why I have decided to vote in favour of this report .
In this Parliament recommendation , the proposal for approval of the regulation proposed by the Council , which should not be delayed , is to simplify the administration of procedures with the new regulation and to ensure equal treatment of legally resident third-country nationals in the field of social security .
The figure is rather shocking , and I mentioned this figure in the report that I drafted during the previous term of office of this House .
But EU Arctic policy may even be a less emotional idea than the appointment of a fully unqualified Baroness Ashton , Sa Pallin of former left-wing students , for the High Representative .
One such achievement is the free trade agreement with South Korea signed on 6 October , which is the most ambitious trade agreement concluded so far by the European Union , and which must be a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels , because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed , and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I think we have attached too little importance to the development of completely new types of cars , hydrogen cars , electric battery cars and cars on fuel cells .
Then we will all go our own way .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand during this complex process , the European Union is willing to support the country as much as it can .
For this derogation , which should make it possible to create jobs and wealth , to really benefit the local population and not to harm the European fish processing and canning industries , it was essential to have an impact assessment as quickly as possible and to allow it to be cancelled if necessary .
This is what the Commission and the Council are doing at the moment in a very commendable way to ensure that gas deliveries are restored as soon as possible ; the threats of triggering a legal dispute are , of course , not very effective .
Member States urgently and without delay must investigate cases of extreme human rights abuses by Roma women , punish the perpetrators and ensure that all the victims are found and are compensated .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a rather complicated issue .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of working with the national supervisory authorities , but also - and we have not yet spoken about this - the importance of cooperation with the national parliaments and , in particular , with the committees on European affairs , budgets and budgetary surveillance .
At this time , when the European External Action Service establishes its rules of access to data and documents , I suggest you make sure that this is a modern organisation , open to a citizen who does not treat foreign policy as a assumption in the secrecy of functioning diplomats .
All countries are currently changing their economic policies in order to emerge as quickly as possible from an unfavourable economic situation and to achieve at least a kind of level of economic growth .
Let me also mention the Japanese people .
Mr Barroso has replied to me that this is an internal matter .
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened , but should preserve and strengthen .
It is no secret that the sources of our European identity stem directly from a Christian tradition .
Although this benefits large corporations , it also hinders public transport and causes an ever-deterioration in the network &apos;s state of affairs and a reduction in safety .
On the other hand , we cannot leave the debate on Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU to one side .
This risk must be managed effectively and the tragic events in Japan remind us that it needs to be done immediately .
The main objective of the Agreement is to provide greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or plummeted items used in medicine .
In short , I may end this report this evening , but the work is far from being done , not for me or for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and emphasise that my group - right from the very beginning - has been rather vigilant in accepting SIS II due to numerous implications for data protection .
The appropriate conditions must be provided .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman received a total of 3.098 complaints compared to 2008 , when 3.406 , which represents a drop of 9 % , were 3.06 .
In its October decision , the European Court also clearly rejected the forced retirement age .
In the area of safety , the environment and the smooth road transport , too , considerable potential of EGNOS and GNSS systems can be exploited , as they can be used to pay for tolls .
Cohesion , which accounts for nearly one third of the budget , remains a budgetary area where the estimated error rate exceeds 5 % .
I would , of course , also like to thank the rapporteurs for submitting a report that has received majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposed way out of the crisis into a green economy , that is , through energy , broadband networks and innovation , is to open up the way for big business to new profitable industries , not to protect the environment and not to serve the needs of the ordinary people .
I therefore share the concern that you have expressed that such an important objective for the Hungarian Presidency , instead of what unites us , could distort national debates or peculiarities .
I agree with the frequent payment of costs based on prior authorisation , in justified and precise cases , where cross-border healthcare covers the collection of a patient in a hospital of at least one night and requires highly specialised and costly medical equipment , or where there is a major risk to a patient or population .
The best road to our leadership role would be , and this is still the case now , if we were to push for more onerous reduction targets , at least 30 % .
Deficits are particularly harmful to those players who are really working to cushion damage in the environment .
The visa scandals do , of course , show how relaxed the accession of some countries has visas .
The destitute populations of rural areas who are most in need of financial resources are left to fend for themselves once again .
I know that you are capable of facing these challenges .
- Mr President , the Czech Republic , I warmly welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orbán has not presented himself to the groups of the European Parliament as a European politician seeking consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; blow &apos; , which kills populist and nationalistic tone &apos; protecting Hungarians from &apos; attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I see the report as a positive one and I congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to build a nuclear bomb .
I am totally opposed to the idea of the United States of preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
This is , however , only one of the conditions for European stability .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s report is very important , because we will be able to establish a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
On the basis of this , we are committing ourselves to creating a situation in which the fishing sector is sustainable and able to develop in the long term .
As we know , living conditions in the wonderful Arctic region have claimed , and it is also clear that with new technologies and achievements , the region will gradually be open to making greater use of natural resources , starting with fishing .
Youth unemployment rates reached 20 % at the beginning of the year as a result of the economic crisis , while the school leaving rate reached 17 % , all of which particularly affected young people in rural areas .
There is currently an extremely wide range of environmental signs , images and texts on the market that can confuse consumers , from the images of forests on vessels containing hazardous substances , to claim on non-carbon foods , and even eco-cars .
in writing . - We voted against this proposal as it advocates taking responsibility for the rubber of the underdeveloped third world countries instead of the countries of this part of the world itself .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for stepping up all the time and treating a lunch , but I do so every 10 years , so maybe you will not mind it .
This is a delicate function ; a function that needs to change things for the better , but it simply does not have enough experience .
Only last year , we agreed to abolish these rules , and while consumers did not notice a great difference , they have seen it and are still aware of it by our producers .
I believe that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only about saving and reducing citizens &apos; social rights .
We must not allow the budget to be reduced for the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , because this would mean that agriculture in Europe is probably less worthy .
At the same time , large direct direct indirect and indirect costs are being generated as a result of the early closure of such large-scale power plants envisaged in economic calculations .
I would therefore like to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction at the compromise proposal reached in the context of the negotiations .
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , honourable Valdis Zatlers , it is a great pleasure for us all to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the dramatic situation has grown apart .
By concluding an agreement with a third country through which the flows of illegal immigration can take place and by concluding a readmission agreement - which is a goal - to upgrade the European Union agreement with such a third country - which is a general approach and the principle of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum - we are essentially consolidating the borders of the Member States of the European Union .
We regret that the report did not fully adopt our proposals , but we welcome the fact that the completion of the report is very close to our conclusions .
Given that promoting a more competitive agricultural system in an open environment for world trade is one of the tasks that President Barroso has set out to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I will take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner in Parliament and ask him how he sees his own cooperation with his responsible colleague for agriculture in concluding the Doha Round .
The report proposes to simplify monitoring and financial supervision and reinforce technical and scientific assessment through a peer review based on excellence .
The proposals that have been made here today should be viewed , analysed and understood in this respect .
We must also highlight the legal and administrative obstacles ( legal personality , financial regulations and , in some cases , intellectual property ) , which can discourage a number of important actors in the fields of research and small and medium-sized enterprises from cooperating .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will reconsider Directive 2007 / 52 , in view of the aspects that it has just given .
That is why I also voted for a point which highlights corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , on a new point that we have developed together , that is , on the question of transparency , progress has been rather slow recently and that , with the new rules on access to documents , the possibility has , in fact , been reduced to those who conduct infringement proceedings or require infringement proceedings have not been brought to light .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) As my colleague , Mr Charles Tannock , I would like to say that in this House , who is unfortunately always half-empty at this hour , we are not debating the terrible human rights situation in Burma for the first time .
It is therefore up to society to act in such a way that women and men can freely choose between two logical possibilities , both of which are legitimate , if we look from a broader perspective and not just from the perspective of work .
It now promotes the consumption of products with reduced nutritional value , making thousands of livestock farmers unable to market their products in the country , which accounts for 50 % of its needs , on the white dog .
The overall consequences of the current situation on our portfolios and the development of our business cannot yet be clearly defined .
In the context of the Middle East peace process , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is just as important today - maybe even more important , whenever ever .
Fossil fuels create a centralised , hierarchical and inflexible distribution of energy .
In this respect , I share the views highlighted by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , it is now half the Hungarian Presidency of the EU , so we need to look into what has been achieved so far .
In my opinion , in reviewing the first railway package , it is necessary , above all , to identify the problems faced by the Member States , which have received explanations of opinion from the Commission , and it also needs to identify the ways in which they can be dealt with .
Israel is not aware that such a broad military response promotes new potential suicide assassinations and attracts new casinos at the earliest opportunity .
The authorities in Burma have chosen not to take into account the protests against the closure of Aung San Suu Kyi and the calls for her release by a large number of states and organisations , including the Secretary-General of the United Nations , the ASEAN Secretary-General and the numerous Member States of ASEAN , to which Burma also belongs .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , pointed out that the guarantees for the EIB &apos;s activities in the EU budget at the end of 2009 were nearly EUR 20 billion , which is also very great for the EU , and so , in my opinion , Parliament quite rightly expects clarification on the risks associated with this obligation .
It is unfortunate that Finland has already supported this project , but on behalf of Tim Soini , and I would now like to find out on my behalf where information about this project , which the citizens of all the countries in the Baltic Sea need before construction work can start .
Without active cooperation from the Czech Republic , this decision would never have been taken .
I believe that an information campaign on this issue is necessary .
Since 1999 , Serbia has , in fact , failed to ensure that people &apos;s personal documents from Kosovo are checked .
Action has been taken in this area , too , and clear and precise rules have been introduced .
Are they looking for a vision proposed by Mr Corbett , the United States of Europe , or rather a relaxed vision of a free market for Europe supported by my party ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patrizia Toia , on the quality of the report which she is presenting today .
This is not impunity - impunity is if the current situation continues for several years to come .
It is rare for someone who embodies so many qualities to be met .
And I am sure we will all agree in Slovenia that we , of course , also have such a burdensome test to do right now .
It is not a good sign that some Member States do not want an employment summit this Thursday .
We have seen a great deal done to meet the criteria and we therefore call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all the requirements as soon as possible .
In such a situation , to allow the Moldovan Government to force its inhabitants to finance such uncertain European programmes and agencies as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky ATM Research Programme ( SESAR ) , although Moldova is neither a member of the European Union , it reminds itself of cynicism .
We would be dealing with two birds with one another because this infrastructure could boost the European economy and give jobs and could mitigate the consequences of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit in Hanta Mansijscus , it was agreed that our common objective is to reach a strategic agreement which would create a comprehensive framework for EU-Russia relations in the near future and help create opportunities for them .
It is now clear that there is still a lack of requirements in the Mediterranean area , and Libya in particular : we need to think a little more about it in order to realise that we may need stronger measures to understand what is happening and also to apply coordinated measures for the Mediterranean .
The significant funding of this line by Europe was conditional on the project being supported by the local population and funded by private Italian investment .
( SK ) Madam President , reports on the accession process in the Balkan countries were published a week ago .
That is why we also abstained on the proposals from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on the TV1 issues in Portugal , although the Portuguese Communist Party criticises this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed a reporting system based on each country that transnational corporations should respond with reports on an equal footing .
The key issue highlighted in the report is the problem of prostitution and trafficking in women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to address you directly .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to completing the Court &apos;s work , the arrest and trial of Mladić and Hadžić will not be ended .
I also call on the Commission to support the compensation requirements imposed on those responsible companies by flying farmers who have not faithfully trapped their own livestock .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) in order to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find solutions to it , we must continue to apply the same approach .
But you know that our message is structural reform ; structural reforms to maximise Europe &apos;s growth potential and capacity for job creation are essential .
Particularly during the current global financial crisis , this partnership can be the strongest and can open up greater opportunities for commercial , scientific and technological exchanges , enabling us to emerge from this crisis in stronger and more stable positions .
We can no longer tolerate inaction .
in writing . - Approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has given rise to increased responsibility for Parliament , along with the administrative burden that is associated with this .
In a period of unprecedented crisis that is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort must be made to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or poor workers does not reach 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption , which I have proposed , along with four other Members , and which has been adopted by more than half of the European Parliament with a view to committing the Council and the Commission to legislation that is genuinely effective in the fight against corruption .
Mr President , the chairs of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , are fully joining your programme for Parliament and for the leadership of Parliament over the next five years .
Let us keep these promises in the name of democracy !
We believe that it is through such a dialogue that we will be able to help these countries , especially through greater cooperation with civil society .
Although I , as a socialist , believe that the gutter would not , under the conditions in Sri Lanka , bring a solution , the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
This is the right time to defend simpler , less costly measures for small and medium-sized enterprises , which will , of course , create the possibility of more jobs and more growth .
In the fight against this phenomenon , it is very important to adopt uniform security measures in the European Union , including repackaging .
Whenever we talk about collective claims , let us also think about the United States and the extremes there .
The imminent entry into force of the agreements on extradition and legal assistance between the EU and the US would encourage cooperation in the area of criminal law , as well as remove the grey of the hitherto enabling exceptional renditions flights .
I have three proposals , and I would very much like to ask for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already made several requests for concrete judgments , whether sport is exclusively of social interest or , conversely , includes economic aspects , which would mean that this activity is of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens should be one of the most important tasks of our institution , and that citizens should know this .
Only then will it show whether this proves to be a marginal issue and whether the unquestionable positive results of the directive will prevail .
By modernising freight logistics and promoting co-modality , i.e. by combining different modes of transport within the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase progress in the Baltic region .
The Member States must decide through a democratic process whether they want to ratify the current ILO Convention .
According to Eurostat data , in January 2011 , the minimum monthly income was between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that will ultimately be adopted will not be so bad .
The Copenhagen Summit was disappointing for various reasons .
We call on international donors , both government and non-governmental , to stop performing their activities in some areas if the bill is adopted .
This is a barrier to the legal protection of individual rights and an aspect that we must discuss again .
( DE ) Mr President , thank you very much .
Václav Havel told us today that Europe is the homeland of our homelands .
So , if , on a police officer in Slovakia , I am invited to respond in Slovak , even if Hungarian is his mother tongue and his reply is in Slovak .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to look again at one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the field of police and justice in relation to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the US .
In 2009 , we saw a worrying increase in various forms of national protection both in the individual Member States of the European Union and in the new emerging economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency has not been taken seriously - either by the Commission or by the Council .
Finally , in the area of politics , it is important to have an alliance within the framework of the World Trade Organisation with the ACP countries .
We need to do something else .
If we can help to bring together the abandoned orphan family and the family that yearns for children , then our contribution will really be very important .
As an important step towards making the 2020 strategy a success , I would therefore like to talk in particular about how important it is for the various EU institutions to stop competition against each other and for us to work seriously on the instruments without which the objectives of the 2020 strategy cannot be achieved .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU &apos;s humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza also require a strategic and long-term reflection on the issue of Gaza .
It is therefore necessary to develop other indicators which will help clarify what factors affect the country &apos;s living standards .
Health professionals believe that treatment with the right medicines can postpone , for a year , the time for sufferers to move to an expensive care institution .
Mr Tajani , the Commissioner for Industry and Enterprise , has made a commitment to consider losses in this sector .
Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft conclusions which aim to implement the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , this vote tomorrow is essentially a vote on the state of the European Parliament .
In an uncertain global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union must strengthen its strategic autonomy and defend its values , pursue its interests and protect its citizens , for which it must develop a shared vision of the major challenges and threats , and provide its capacity and resources for an appropriate response , thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
Now is good time for mutual relations and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This will represent a step forward in the direction of greater transparency in the European institutions , and I hope that it will contribute to giving the European project among the citizens of Europe greater legality .
I propose to you that you look at the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and on the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - , and
But , if we want to be successful , then we also need to support this action through strong , strong and determined policy measures .
Mrs Ronresults , I will tell you this last time .
I would have liked exclusions to have been set out with a clear time limit or with definitive criteria , however they are regulated , perhaps the Commission would have considered which proposals it intends to propose in order to meet India &apos;s requirements to some extent .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning I have heard all possible criticisms made of the Italian Prime Minister except for the fact that , thanks to their entrepreneurial actions , tens of thousands of people provide jobs .
However , if we are discussing this at the right moment , it is a matter for Parliament itself to reflect on .
This is why this report highlights the importance of an unknown programme , but also calls for change : amendment of overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations and low performance rates , which is still too inaccessible to small and medium-sized enterprises at a time when the funding of research is still important in terms of transforming the research results into products and services ; ensuring better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders , at a time when the funding of research and national funds is still divided .
It is a fact that the ECB is not independent in the Greek crisis ; it has chosen the other way .
It will not lead to a failure of competitiveness in our industries .
He called for a global ban on the so-called &apos; body scanners &apos; .
Statistics show that cardiovascular diseases cause approximately 4.3 million deaths in Europe every year , and over 1.7 million people die from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective public health measure to protect Europeans from infectious diseases , but it is also important for healthcare to reach developing countries so that it can contribute to longer life expectancy and the fight against poverty .
We must therefore state loud that the banks are using the new rules that have been introduced in the euro area to increase their profits at the expense of the citizens is pure stupidity .
Indeed , in this economic situation and , furthermore , here in the European Parliament , we must ensure that expenditure is managed .
This is why I believe that enhanced protection for the rights of industrial property , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
He has played an important role in observing all the trials before the Supreme National Security Tribunal and periodically assessing the detention conditions in Syria .
We need a European strategy in order to combat natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
At the time , all the new Member States appeared to be following the EU &apos;s basic principles and the ban on discrimination and to safeguard and value linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
It not only applies to financial credit , but also to social credit .
These new measures would help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights , particularly with regard to the recognition of qualifications and their social rights and their right to reside .
This issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just unique .
In its conclusions , the Council is encouraging the Commission to continue its impact assessment so that , if necessary , an EU legislative proposal on bio-degradable waste can be drawn up by 2010 .
It is a fact : men have the right to participate fully in the first few days after the child &apos;s family arrival .
These efforts deserve understanding and not criticism , although this is not the most important thing in all .
The reality is that we in Europe need to make our total dependence on Russian energy supplies a difference .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the eleventh largest trading partner of the European Union : trade relations between the European Union and Canada accounted for 1.6 % of the EU &apos;s common external trade in 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to point out that I did not include this in the Rules of Procedure , but Marylène Renault .
The fishing sector of the country is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at today &apos;s debate , we are discussing four reports , so I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their work and the European Commission for their cooperation .
With regard to the summit , I very much agree that this is an important opportunity .
The regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage in a uniform and unbureaucratic way - and here I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s comments - throughout the EU without interfering in existing cooperation between the Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama has said that the representatives of China are invited to consider the documents of the government in exile to make sure he has not encouraged violence .
This is their answer to the difficulties that are hampering their progress and integrating into the world .
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
Every day , we have seen numerous demagogic claims in the media , but also here in the European Parliament , that we have no professional basis whatsoever .
As human rights are a key aspect of the agreement that binds the EU and Pakistan , autonomous trade preferences must be dependent on respect for human rights in that country .
That is why I voted for the directive on the energy performance of buildings as it is intended to have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , because it directly affects the buildings in which they live and use them .
Amendment 9 establishes an unacceptable position - albeit temporary - derogations from the principles on which the European Union is founded , including four basic freedoms .
It is unacceptable for us that Parliament should state this as a reason for calling for a larger budget .
It is time that we finally walked this one-sided privilege of the United States .
Mr Dalli and the Commission , now that we have this directive , I would be pleased if we paid more attention to the regulation on social security , which is the fundamental system in which it is clarified who is paid , and in which it is increasingly well organised .
Let us never lose sight of our aim , let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way to preserve and protect the Arctic for future generations .
I think it was very necessary , and it is a good example of the achievement of this Parliament in shaping the budget using resources which , as I say , have not been used in other areas .
Let us now look at the hypothesis .
If we want this , we will have to make every effort to invest in limiting the energy intensity of the economy in all sectors .
In such sensitive sectors as clothes , leather goods and furniture , the establishment of conditions for the consumer to decide on the basis of facts is an important issue for those companies that have chosen to retain production in Europe , thereby keeping European knowledge and European jobs .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has not managed to put a stop to this extremely destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument that promotes the strengthening of relations with third countries with some tangible benefits .
Moreover , this is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission not only has the right , but is also obliged to express its opinion .
With this draft document , we have broken up and we have done so because we have to look after patients .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency .
I believe that every patient has the right to enjoy quality care and care provided in his language , close to the place where he or she live , and to his family .
When we speak in this Chamber , we must use the terms adopted by everyone , and by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , a candidate country , has been adopted as the &apos; Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos; and not as a &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This can be achieved and would bring about better results .
Recent events in the European economy , including with regard to Greece , have shown that there is a pressing and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
In order not to lag behind , Stuart Wheeler &apos;s donor has stated that membership costs us EUR 120 billion per year , which is about 3 times more than the actual amount .
I hope that he succeeds in this two-pronged approach to Belarus - I think Mr Tannock called him a &apos; stick and carrot &apos; .
We can talk about other matters - energy , the prevention of proliferation , and many others too , but most importantly , in my opinion , the three reports before us today have a fundamental consensus on what we have been working on in the last period .
Then he also said that the Commission should start considering the possibility of Eurobonds - finally , I could say .
Situation in Lithuania following the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors ( debate )
This is not the credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises
Under this regulation , tyre suppliers must use labels and labels which will provide users with information on fuel consumption and rolling resistance , wet down a brick based on and external rolling resistance .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
In this attempt to make the EU more ambitious and ambitious objectives more ambitious , I also think that in the final phase of the COP 16 negotiations , the European Union should give its main negotiator more flexibility in order to be able to respond to developments during the negotiations .
Therefore , balanced and transparent measures are essential , since obtaining the confidence of our entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for the success of the project .
There is the problem of the catastrophic impact of extensive urbanisation on the environment , particularly in coastal areas and in Spanish islands , as well as in other areas , such as Hungarians , for example .
It is important for the Special Representative for Central Asia to monitor the situation very closely , in close cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the European Commission .
These procedures include the necessary maintenance and surveillance after closure ; recovery , storage and decontamination of waste ; environmental upgrading of facilities ; and support in replacing the energy capacity of the decommissioned power plants , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
That is my conviction .
I come from a country where , whenever I go to the supermarket , I meet a man who is driving a bicycle with a engine which , on the other hand , has a lodged bicycle .
For example , there has been a very comprehensive debate on the sale of fertile land in developing countries and countries which do not have arable land ; their purchase is a very interesting topic for debate , and I think it is also a subject on which we can achieve a common understanding .
However , the key objectives of the European Union , without a trans-European network , will not be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco is hosted in 17 of the 27 Member States , and in any case , governments also provide subsidies .
One of the three - English , French or German - will apply automatically to ensuring legal certainty in the EU .
This is a very controversial topic in Ireland and it is only water to all those who argue in favour of rejecting the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Presidency has made every effort to reach an agreement , but ultimately it has concluded that the European Council must decide .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that our opinions sometimes differ .
That is how the Commission will work .
This was perhaps a one-off event related to relocation into the new , permanent sites of the agency .
The proposed amendments will also enable less developed Member States , including Romania , to benefit from this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , it is very encouraging that so many Members across the House should commend the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
I do not need to emphasise either point in the current situation .
Together , we will work towards a successful conclusion to the Doha Round in 2010 , because this is extremely important in helping to promote recovery and fight protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a special day for me because , after ten years of good and loyal service , I was the last to hold the sitting here in Brussels .
From the point of view of efficiency , I also consider it interesting that these delegations should take on some consular functions , such as the regulation of Schengen visas .
We seem to have spent a great deal of time discussing among ourselves on a daily basis instead of discussing it with others , and we have rightly been overcome in the end .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s draft should be better prepared , so Parliament must take more time to make decisions .
Perhaps it is planned to go even further than what is now on the table .
Without the European Union and its protective shield , all Member States would be much worse off .
As a social democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress towards general basic education , reducing poverty and improving access to safe drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso , with the Treaty of Lisbon , told us that the Commission is speaking with a voice on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
There can be opinions , there may even be disagreements , even Eurosceptics may be allowed , but the final outcome must be the same .
Lukashenko , a great political ashist , has been able to carry out his pre-election campaign and to exploit all political and economic benefits , while showing constant contempt for democracy and human rights .
In this joint statement , the European Union and Russia have therefore announced negotiations and the conclusion of agreements between Russia and the European Union &apos;s neighbouring Member States on local border traffic .
This is crucial for the future prosperity of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself have spoken about the summits that still need to be filled in the implementation of our legislation in many Member States .
We must treat these people as free populations and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must realise that the people of the South of Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure that their recycling can not only prevent environmental and health damage , but also reduce the loss of raw materials .
I must warn you that there is still an international arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir , which is disregarded by the authorities in that country .
This letter also endorses the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the first year of the project &apos;s operation , and appropriate preparatory work has begun .
Mr President , I would expect you to call for order .
As far as the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal is basically reasonable , because it addresses the prohibition and gradual exchange of resources that have a serious harmful effect on human health .
The purpose of the proposal for a decision is to set out the fishing opportunities for European Union vessels on the basis of the available surplus stock , as well as the financial contribution separately for access rights and assistance for the sector .
In the EU , we must give all the help of the Tunisian Government of unity , and we must give all our assistance to EU citizens , including the British citizens who have been stranded there after they were on holiday in Tunisia .
Fellow Members , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and proper for the island of Taiwan to be transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these traditional means of communication are often unsuccessful , either for commercial interests or because their management belongs to a certain political centre and indirectly requires employees to exercise self-censorship .
We cannot coexist in the European Union , while this situation continues , and we therefore consider it very important that the Commission , the bodies of the European Union and all of us make proposals for the same purpose to bring this situation to an end .
That is one thing and I will be following many social , environmental and economic criteria as well , because I am committed to assessing all the legislation in advance .
That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , it is very good that we are talking about Belarus in the European Parliament , but speaking is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to support the motion and defend it .
I am pleased to see that East Jerusalem is speaking about the capital of a future Palestinian state , or Jerusalem , two states .
The third thing we can learn is that the European Union must be prepared .
There are even major differences between regions in the same Member State .
Prevention and elimination of violence against women are essential strategic objectives , which are important for the progress our civilisation is making .
I look forward to hearing your answers .
The previous results of the referendum in 10 southern countries were announced on 30 January and showed that the vaccine was supported by a large majority ( 9.5 % ) .
Personally , I think that Europe needs a united energy policy in order to avoid over-dependence on resources from a single area .
The UVO has also revealed the huge flaws in the traceability system employed by Brazil and has revealed the difficulties that many shipments in transit to the European Union have not had the necessary approval .
These committees will now be able to speak in an exchange .
So I think the most important question now is : how and what can we continue to build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency ?
Following this crisis , the role of the European Union must be strengthened .
The central part of this proposal is the insistence on mutual dialogue , the fact that opinions must be taken into account and respected .
I urge the Lithuanian authorities to renew the Polish names of the streets and towns in regions where the majority of the inhabitants of the Polish minority are members .
Since all these measures are interconnected , indispensable and compatible with the level of ambition set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious result , in accordance with citizens &apos; expectations as soon as possible .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it brings about a significant improvement in the situation .
For this reason , I have voted in favour of this report .
This report aims at raising the level of permitted risk , simplifying bureaucratic monitoring mechanisms and increasing confidence in the scientific and business community .
Mr President , I support the comments made by Mr Daul .
The resolution adopted today highlights the fact that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operator , while respecting their different or specific identity .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask a question to the President of the Commission , who has been employed by discussing the photographs that we have seen in recent weeks from the Mediterranean , where many people have managed to flee from the situation in Africa to Europe , while some have failed .
In any case , this is not happening and the situation in Lampedusa is a sad example of this .
Israel bombing and dozens of gestures .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the common agricultural policy and food security is an important issue .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and progressive debate .
This must be a partnership based on mutual respect , respect for shared commitments and also for the values championed by the European Union when it comes to human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and creates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
That is why , in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , we have tabled an amendment calling for - not only with regard to Europe , of course , we are also very appealing to the United States , as the Commissioner knows very well - a very rapid complete abolition of all kinds of export subsidies .
Most of those who contributed highlight the need to direct the CAP or its focus on the competitiveness of European agriculture , respond to climate change , food security and quality requirements and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit due to take place in May .
The next item is the joint debate on :
It is , of course , extremely important that the European Union increase the specific subsidies for cities , because there is great potential for the economy and finance in cities , as cities have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will only be formally presented next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , as recommended by scientists , and in order to halt the decline in biodiversity , we need significant financial resources .
Only the carrot and stick that form the key dynamism of the accession process can force the governments of these countries to focus on doing the work and reforms that can , for the time and for all , consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
Given their importance , I will focus on two reports .
In the interests of legal certainty for all those involved throughout Europe , we must guarantee equal rights for those who are accused of crimes , and they must be made obligatory to inform .
External affairs and diplomacy come under national sovereignty , so we voted against all the reports on this matter .
I am talking about the article in favour of Mr Weber .
I also appreciate the positive assessment of the ongoing efforts of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the situation in the region expressed in the proposal .
I hope that the events in Greece will not come across for a few hours ago , and I hope that this can be a sign , on the contrary , of a unanimous effort to create a European identity with solidarity and partnership .
We have been in contact every hour with those in Tunisia and with the people of Egypt , with our delegations , whom I salute for what they have had to deal with over the last few weeks , and we have been in direct contact with the government and with the services .
I am convinced that this financial instrument is even more important as a result of the financial crisis , as it enables a more effective economic recovery , and in future it may be a pilot project for creating a more generous energy fund .
These inspections were inadequate .
Then we will be able to make a major contribution from Europe , but it must not be unscrupulous .
I voted in favour of the European Ombudsman &apos;s special report following the draft recommendation to the European Commission in complaint No 676 / 2008 / RT concerning the excessive delay in response to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
Compared with the existing legislation , the main progress made with this directive is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and have access to information on the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I would reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in a flexible manner , as well as to review the regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund with the aim of adapting to the requirements arising from the tragedy .
Following consultation with consumer rights organisations and representatives of the business world , I understand that we must insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I have already said that anyone who raises questions will be designated as a negative guys in this debate .
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case , trade agreements - and political intervention with the parliamentary means at its disposal , such as the presentation , resolutions and oral questions , in order to take note of the progress of these negotiations .
There is no acknowledgement here of citizens &apos; input in social cohesion or inter-generational solidarity .
Legal reform relates to admissibility .
This is one of the most serious issues of human rights in the European Union today .
It is therefore necessary to make adequate financial resources available to enable opportunities to be taken , and new sources of global competitiveness to be exploited by the EU .
In many European countries where public authorities are in trouble , they usually tend to settle their obligations belatedly and often , as a result , certain companies go bankrupt .
The G20 conference also set fiscal havens at risk as one of its key objectives .
However , such an answer is not from the political class .
The dollar , of course , remains the king of world transactions and still provides a secure investment , but the huge debt they have accumulated in the United States , which has claimed the rest of the world to invest in their lifestyles , will go increasingly far beyond doubt over the ability of the first economic power to fulfil its commitments .
We must provide society with the right tools and the right measures to combat and defeat those who want to destroy it .
Iceland , which was not even interested in joining the European Union , has shown itself to be so long as it was rich .
This is not a new request , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving all actors in order to ensure a very high level of agreement among the local communities .
However , there is a problem that is forcing the international terrorism into neighbouring countries and areas as much as they continue the conflict in Afghanistan for as long as possible .
We must fight fragmentation and I call on Commissioner Andor , both , to retain the comprehensive regulations of the European Social Fund and not to divide this fund , as is sometimes proposed in this House .
Of course , things are such that we do not get everything we want in the compromise .
I would also like to take this opportunity to once again thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug for their constructive attitude throughout the budget process , as evidenced by our very good cooperation in this work .
The Socialist Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent assassinations of human rights activists in Russia .
It would be better to stress that this is not about negotiations with an unknown end , which would allow more realistic alternatives than a privileged partnership .
That is why , above all , this is the US problem , which Washington must solve .
I would also like to say that we should embark on reforms which would guarantee universities more independence and would make them more European , open students and researchers , and more dynamic in building a knowledge society .
The journey they buy can be stored in national reserve and distributed later if the Member States so wish .
I therefore call once again for 25 May , his execution day , he asks himself for International Day for the heroes of the fight against totalitarianism , as many unknown people who , like Pilecki , have sacrificed their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be remembered .
Let me touch briefly on the issues that we have done .
If this is to become a majority in the European Union in the next parliamentary term , it would destroy a strongly funded peace plan , which consists of the wars in the Balkans .
I really hope that this will encourage people to participate in EMAS , not because I want to play the game of the figure and to see EMAS competing with the ISO , but because I think the system is good and could help us meet our sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker answered a blue-card question from Cristian Dan Preda under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be very important and I trust it will go well .
Regulatory dumping and its social consequences should no longer be tolerated .
This aspect is essential for ensuring an effective Neighbourhood Policy .
By defining best practices resulting from experiences in the Member States , and by following basic standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment , and by protecting against direct and indirect expropriation , we will have the foundations for a coherent European policy on this issue .
I know that during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , partners in the sheep meat sector advocated mandatory origin marking .
Mr Kelly , I am aware of the complexity of this issue .
Although most countries are facing numerous economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to halting the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will provoke a serious parliamentary debate on reform of the own resources system .
The whole legitimacy for these measures has thus increased .
President of the Commission . - Like the European Parliament , the Commission has the right to express its opinions on the audit process .
The levels of fraud in Spain and France , for example , are supposedly low .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solutions and in whether their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to set up a network for exchanging statistical data via Member States and a platform for carrying out research into the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I also agree with many in this House that relations between Europe and Russia will be better if we have more European solidarity .
As far as freedom of speech and association is concerned , Syria still has a long way to go .
Much remains to be done to ensure women have fair access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate the need to reassess that the proposal is thus subject to compliance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware that the situation of dairy producers is unsustainable .
I voted in favour of the report because I particularly wanted to highlight one danger mentioned : the lack of meaningful and wide-ranging information for consumers on health features , composition and origin of certain types of fish .
After all , history is full of examples of intervention by Western countries , which had previously damaged rather than benefited .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and that crime prevention is incapable of tackling for several reasons .
The agreement between Palestinians is a key political event and , unlike what we have just heard in this Chamber , Hamas has recognised PLO and the Palestinian Authority as a partner in the negotiations .
Countries are arguing and negotiating the division of the marine bottom .
The last is a particularly important sector , taking into account the problems with the energy infrastructure that ...
In other words , it is precisely the institution that is supposed to protect us against criminals ( indirectly by providing professional training to police officers ) that ends up on the suitability benches .
However , the transfer of power from Fidela Castro &apos;s hand to his brother Raúl did not bring either democratic reforms or the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency assessments will be shown in all advertisements containing information on energy consumption or related to product prices .
Ladies and gentlemen , you all know about the Washington Consensus : you were impressed by it .
In this way , we could also react appropriately to the realities on the ground which Frontex is already examining anyway .
Finally , I would like once again to thank the rapporteur , the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the various committees that have worked together for their very positive and constructive efforts .
We have worked on this with the Czech Presidency and I very much appreciate the support of the Presidency in our efforts to find a viable way forward .
Particularly in view of Mr Wessberg &apos;s commitment to the private company sector , the candidate is particularly pertinent in striking a balance between EU legislation and the specific demands of the market and also the people of Europe .
Up until now , the conflict in 17 days has claimed 1 000 lives .
The number of falsified medicines will decrease , and the use of medicines will only be safer by taking such measures .
We also need to learn from the Opel dossier : it is not yet too late to launch a coherent European strategy for the automotive sector .
We did this because , like you , President Obama and I reject the wrong choice between security and our ideals .
The pact for the euro is , unfortunately , proposed to make wage savings a permanent one .
Recently , a new attempt was launched at the airport in Manchester , and the legal advice was given that the application of these devices on minors could constitute a violation of childcare and safety laws against the nature of the dream produced .
Furthermore , the money will not go directly to the artists .
In the field of civil aviation , it is necessary to support the development of the EGNOS system and the use of EGNOS applications for landing procedures .
Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations , as well as for the relevant maritime management measures ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations ( recast ) - Sewage inspection of the State of ports ( recast ) - Standarkness and notification of shipping ,
I am voting in favour of the report on the creation of a new microfinance instrument that will help people whose jobs are at risk , create or develop micro-enterprises .
It is important that the report by Mr Vlasák , with which I strongly agree , has made some progress in this direction , and I think that this report will enable us to define better the legal framework of the issues of the cities and also to introduce instruments such as municipal operational programmes as operational programmes that can give cohesion policy new quality .
During the trialogue , it became clear to me that the improvements that I presented on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and efficient energy markets .
During the current economic crisis , it is extremely important that the self-employed be supported and encouraged .
In short , there is no need to ask Brussels for them .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( ES ) Mr President , it is clear to all of us , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and the whole of Europe that energy has become a foreign policy tool , an element of change that can interest in conflict or unite us , and that is precisely the subject we are dealing with today .
I voted in favour of this report as the food programme we are considering is a key instrument for helping those at risk who are suffering greatly in the current economic crisis , even when it comes to meeting basic needs .
In most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , at least one officially supported export credit agency ( ECAs ) , and ECAs represent the largest source of official financing for private sector projects in the world .
That is why we do not vote in favour of the report .
By taking this position , we have helped to bring this common government down .
With the establishment of Conseil Français du culmummut in 2003 , Mr Sarkozy , who was Minister for the Interior at the time , introduced Islam into the French institutions .
In this respect , I have already asked the European Commission for an opinion and called on her to consider the possibility of establishing equal opportunities for women in science .
This is a fight that we will continue to fight to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unlimited access by end users to services .
Great European politicians and thinkers knew very well that a common approach to economic problems was a force that was able to bring Europe together .
The borders between freedom and security do not stop at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , since this summer , the Commission will take the lead in coordinating the strategy in relation to development in key areas such as the promotion of civic education , vocational guidance and employment .
The cost will be borne by the state of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of the establishment of a more sustainable transport system .
A decision on starting a dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for the stability of the region .
So we can expect an accident with a nuclear reactor every 25 years .
In my opinion , greater eligibility for housing expenditure cofinanced by the ERDF must lead us to consider other possible trends in the medium and long term , whether in terms of eligibility for funding or allocation for certain strategic priorities .
The time has come today to talk again about the violations of religious rights in both countries , this time against Christians .
Climate change : one of the greatest threats facing our planet .
Of course , there was a great deal of emphasis , as I expected , on human rights - on the importance of ensuring that this is a clear part of all the dynamic relations we have and that they cover our work .
I must also say that until now , the European Union does not have the power to regulate air traffic at all .
However , Europe is not an ovation or a cure for the economic crisis .
In this way , I can confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and the optional provisions .
I do not think that any of the warm words that have been voiced here today , nor those expressed by the Commission , can it change the facts , that the European Union is not present in Libya and that it is not even able to stop the crisis in the towns or actions of Mr Gaddafi .
That is why I firmly believe that by adopting these two regulations , the European Parliament would make a lot of benefits for EU citizens because we would have the opportunity to impose much greater choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I , too , hope that the European Council will manage to agree on measures to reassure the markets and the euro area once again , because this should be in all our interests , whether we are its members or not .
Funds in the context of pre-accession aid have proved particularly sensitive .
This is a reason for a great deal of gratitude and pleasure .
We therefore call on all parties to put an end to war and violence , and we call on the EU to act accordingly .
The world around us faces energy challenges with determination .
The indicator for measuring the energy performance of buildings must be included in advertisements for sales or for rents appearing in the media .
It is important to step up the efforts made to diversify EU investment in cross-border structures , encouraging the production of alternative , unconventional forms of energy at local level and improving infrastructure connections with new energy sources .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market , which , as a result , leads to a growth in internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we should consider creating a rapid response tool within the ENP in order to respond immediately and flexibly to political change in partner countries , as was the case recently in the Southern Neighbourhood .
The fact that someone in this House who supports Serbia condemns the EULEX mission is simply appalling .
The problem , then , is that only the Members who can listen to you in the original language are listening to the problem .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciate the fact that the Swedish Presidency has highlighted issues concerning our fellow citizens , our electorate , namely the changes to the environment and climate , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because in order to do a good job , we need to be in tune with those who have voted through us .
The EU budget cannot , as some Members of the European Parliament claim , be used to supplement national budgets at a time of austerity ; instead , it should reflect the difficult situation in which the EU Member States have found themselves .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty has not given the Council the power to deal with the national constitutions of the Member States .
It is not business as usual .
You can say that I am a cynical , but students do not always arrive at a study , and tourists do not always arrive on a visit for a limited period .
Is it the global financial crisis that has turned into the economic crisis at the root of this situation , is we are tackling our own mistakes , neglect and lack of action here ?
My second &apos; but &apos; concerns the role played by the Belgian Presidency in the period following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The main objective of these regimes was to maintain the territorial integrity of this huge country , which is inhabited by a series of extremely diverse nations .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economic and politicians have already proclaimed the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still facing negative consequences .
It is mainly so in many areas with Japan , but I acknowledge Japan &apos;s right , for example , to protect its market by rice , to protect fish producers , to pay higher prices than they are on world markets , and to oppose mass imports that would destroy the agricultural population , in the same way as I recognise our economies &apos; rights to protect certain sectors of activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I am going to talk about two concepts - coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of older people use the Internet .
For my part , therefore , I am determined to work on this new strategy in order to strengthen the priorities in the social field , as I have already told you , when we discussed the broader political guidelines for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will come to the point straight away to ask you what measures - and here I am using many - the Commission intends to take in the short term to address these shortcomings .
This is what has been lacking until now and it has not been sufficiently visible to our citizens .
Citizens are not interested , and rightly so .
- ( The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m. )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal so that it will support , by an overwhelming majority , the report by Mrs Muscardini , whom I thank , like the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania supports the open-door policy aimed , in particular , at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that , moreover , everything must be done to prevent the effects of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I refer , of course , not only to accidents at work that happen quite often , but also to the hazardous substances used in the working processes .
In September 2009 , the Council started by examining in detail the proposal in order to amend the decision to set up a European Refugee Fund .
With this in mind , it is important to pay particular attention to the islands and the outermost regions , which are currently unable , in addition to the constant difficulties , to the devastated infrastructure and the loss of personal , commercial and agricultural assets , and , in many cases , to resume their normal activities immediately , especially in regions that are almost exclusively dependent on tourism , since media pictures can be imagined by potential visitors .
Since 11 September 2001 , we have not seen such a comprehensive disruption of the industry with such huge financial losses and , regardless of the financial difficulties currently facing all Member States , I would call on them to support plans to support industry that simply cannot refrain from continuing to lose .
At the same time , we must acknowledge that our exposure to risk is also increasing .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in the Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make a minor language and perhaps semantic comment .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
We can want something - we can very much like - but we need to see the reality .
Consumer organisations support binding measures on the judicial system of collective redress in all Member States , along with other options , such as extending existing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms ( ARS ) .
The problems are not down to the Turkish Cypriots , as some people have argued .
I would like to ask the Commission what it has done to ensure slaughter of horses in the country of origin so that they do not have to pass on long and serious trends towards consumer countries .
That is what we need to do .
I sincerely wonder , ladies and gentlemen , where all human rights defenders , who so pleased that the West is secular and pluralistic , are discouraging a disgraceful view from the Middle East , which will slowly create a place for just one religion .
This is in progress and we are in contact with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who spend our money are worthwhile contempts , but Mr Schulz is also irresponsible politicians who are now further increasing their deficits and debts on the backs of the younger generations .
For this , I must thank the French and Czech Presidencies , the Commission and the rapporteurs from the various groups .
We believe that the work now has to be done by the Member States .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been good ; the relationship has , in fact , been squeezed together .
We should strive to ensure that the programmes we are offering are given the greatest possible support to the reforms implemented in these countries in order to bring them closer to the Union .
It is also very important that all Member States maintain national contact points , which provide patients with all the information necessary , e.g. about the availability of healthcare , procedures and the necessary documentation .
Earlier , we felt all events in the Soviet Union with ideological pressure , whereas today we are talking about trade in the situation of complete individual freedom .
Whether this is a private or public fund , this report refers to a very specific matter , namely , firstly , that Parliament observes that it has no legal requirements , that the deficits of this fund are subsidised and , secondly , that there will be no subsidy to such deficits .
They certainly have the most expensive reputation for Helene Tyrojan , for whom thousands of ships have sent in the fight !
Aid that distorts competition undermines the future of the European automotive industry and will have negative consequences for both employment and technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that in the forthcoming debate , we should be aware of things .
You have heard from various Members who have said that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with the reverse voting mechanism .
( FR ) After all this , I think it is very important to remember the real issues at stake here .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
In order to show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric slander , I urge you , today , to paint your garden list and thus express our opposition to this practice .
Democratic control is sidelined , as national governments hide behind the Commission and Trojk in the most basic measures , whereas the Commission addresses these matters to national governments .
New Multiannual Financial Framework ( continuation of debate )
As a result of the threats to the Commission from triggering a conflict before the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now begun to allow the decadlerine decabinet .
It is clear to those of us from the rural constituency , and to those who are on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the current situation in which livestock farmers find themselves is simply untenable .
The savers deserve transparent information that can be understandable and available .
I believe that our task could be to support the Chinese people in achieving harmony in their society .
During the vote , I supported these two mechanisms , because I believe that we need to be demanding and ambitious if we want to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus safeguard our future .
It is also important that the organiser of an initiative - the social organisation or the non-governmental organisation - clearly and specifically define the subject and the objective of an initiative , although it does not have to submit a bill .
In Latvia , the city of the Daugavpils , in which more than 90 % of the population speaks Russian .
I would therefore like to welcome Prime Minister Jan Fischer &apos;s apology , as well as the recent proposal by the government of the Czech Republic , who is demanding from the Ministry of Health that a series of measures be implemented on 31 December 2009 to ensure that such violations no longer take place .
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark for policy makers throughout the world .
At the moment , the effects of globalisation have completely been overshadowed by the financial and economic crisis and the adaptation of the criteria for allocating funds from the EGF is our considered reaction .
in writing . - ( PT ) This resolution implies the signing of the declaration of independence of Kosovo , on 17 February 2008 , recognised by 69 Member States , and encourages Member States to participate in the joint approach to Kosovo , taking into account Kosovo &apos;s planned accession to the EU .
Compared to the other two institutions , we can say that Parliament is leading when it comes to transparency , so I would not make this one of the priorities because , as far as access to the documents and transparency of the meetings and activities of the Members of the European Parliament is concerned , we are more open than any national parliament .
This was the internal formulation of policy by the Italian Minister for Reform , Umberta Bosnia .
I warn the observation of the human rights observation groups in Asturia - my region - and many other organisations deserve to be taken seriously .
I am voting in favour of the Casini report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution in relation to the ban on pork and cattle breeding .
I have therefore chosen to abstain from the vote and will follow closely the investigation under way .
However , the data of the European Commission are not entirely appropriate , nor for determining the measures to be applied to discipline the Member States with the highest level of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions in sectors outside the emissions trading scheme .
Turning to another question , I can assure honourable Members that the Commission is aware of the fact that it is demanding control of antimicrobial resistance of a multidisciplinary approach .
We were very hopeful yesterday &apos;s trialogue about the final agreement .
Additional projects based on an annual growth rate of approximately 27 % in the coming years indicate that this value will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe it is necessary to adapt the legal basis of the proposal so that the text takes the form of a regulation rather than a decision of the Council .
Many people ask me what ACTA means and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because EU financial assistance will help people who have become victims of globalisation to find work and return to the labour market and help them escape recession .
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms , particularly through broadcasting audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and I hope that the EU will play a leading role in radio spectrum and in creating software for development and innovation .
All this consists of common concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe and the problems that arise by accepting a country that shares a border of more than 80 million inhabitants : factors that will further strengthen my unfailing conviction that Turkey is not right to enter Europe , whose unity depends primarily on the Christian spirit .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Protests from the floor )
This means harming environmental and consumer safety because we would return to the market old equipment , which is a huge amount of energy consumed and which may be dangerous .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I wanted to thank the mayor Balingenu , Dr Reiteman and the local world , for enabling this monument to be set to honour these young people .
Thirdly , I have a lot of request to address to Mrs Kroes , namely , to speed up digitisation in the Member States if we are to be proud of this important flagship project in the future .
Anyone who has experienced and seen the consequences of the environmental disaster caused by the mistake of Baia Mare in technology and the resulting release of toxic waste in the islands with massive effects on the River Tislands in Hungary and the Danube in Bulgaria would do everything possible to ensure that something similar in the European Union is not repeated .
This is a responsibility for all of us : Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and businesses ; basic movements , as you said , are crossing the divide .
For this reason , I agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when it proposes rejecting the Commission proposal .
It is important that we have had the courage to convened this summit , that we called on the social partners to participate , that we prepare it together with them more thoroughly - before the Employment Meeting takes place , that three rounds will be organised in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague - and that we try to reach conclusions that will benefit from the June Council .
Indeed , at first reading , the European Parliament established a good foundation for the proper application of the rules on the provision of cross-border health services in the Member States , so that patients , where justified and in accordance with certain rules and without burdening the courts , can receive amicable or hospital care in another Member State .
This was also a proposal in the Barnier report , but we have not yet reached a decision .
There is no time on the walk .
With yet another brutal exercise of distortion of reality , we are once again faced with the European Parliament &apos;s petty attempt to interfere in Venezuela .
In 2009 , the Commission published the material for a debate involving new data , as well as the opinions of the various types of users on this issue , and we will soon touch upon the results of the public consultation .
Thank you for your presence .
I would add that , if a person is detained , this is provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights .
I hope that this amendment will receive majority support tomorrow .
