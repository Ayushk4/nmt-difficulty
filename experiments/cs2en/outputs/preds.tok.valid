Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the London Summit will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report we have debated in the European Parliament on Wednesday indicate that imports of agricultural products from third countries have a much more negative impact on the environment than internal production covered by much stricter rules on reducing carbon dioxide emissions , thereby helping climate change .
It can , in fact , be accepted that the countries that are provided with this money cannot be used .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime authorities in the Member States must cooperate much more with each other to coordinate their training programmes and offer opportunities for paid work and the exchange of experiences with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we are highlighting is that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers .
The FRONTEX agency must be strengthened and , at the same time , the EU must force the leaders of the Member States to fulfil their obligations .
I would like to add one more point which no one has yet mentioned , except Commissioner Almunia .
The following are particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change : water resources , agriculture , energy , forest economies and biodiversity , as well as the health of the population .
Let me also express , on behalf of myself and on behalf of the Commission , regret the death of nine Turkish soldiers and one police in the terrorist attack that took place last week .
Mr Piebalgs , congratulations on what you are doing .
However , it is gratifying that , due to the resistance and fears expressed by the members of the Committee on Culture and Education about the deterioration of education and training policies , especially at a time when unemployment is on the rise and causes problems in numerous Member States of the European Union , the Committee on Budgets has tabled the necessary amendments , which I supported and has increased the previously planned means ( such as Article 1502 for lifelong learning programmes ) .
Then , the minority government came to power with completely different political convictions , but no one thought this would be a coup d &apos;état .
In fact , the fact that we , the international community , looked at when the Abyei question was left unresolved in the referendum is very irresponsible and is a recipe for the future start of the war .
The case of a Romanian player called Mariana Cozmy , who is brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows once again that crime does not recognise borders and that overlooking the problems of this community is counterproductive .
You must have a reliable European food policy .
The Treaty of Lisbon should present a new political model in Europe , both in terms of sharing Member States &apos; resources to achieve optimum results and in terms of efforts to share strategies and operations which create a political union that the founding fathers dreamed of Europe years ago .
That is what we are calling for .
Everyone , as Hungary has done since the beginning , supports the single market .
The impossible climate change is forcing society and the economy of the European Union to adapt to new realities .
The various countries will continue to promote internal stability and help find both socio-economic solutions and address ethnic movements .
It was a wonderful three-year-old affair and , like most of the short-term gloomy affair , I am pleased to see it coming to an end .
It is absolutely essential that NATO maintains its continued vigilance and supports , especially today in Afghanistan .
However , something will have to happen and we will have to set things in motion .
In this regard , common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , will have to be dealt with , excluding the system from the possibility of setting a maximum rate and , last but not least , instead of taxing stocks within the EU .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the highest unemployment rate for young people and our automotive industry has been decimated , partly because the European Union finances jobs in Slovakia , which have taken on a substantial proportion of the Ryton plant .
It is essential to ensure that these new authorities are not forced to weaken or undermine the key rules for reforming the financial sector .
That is too much .
We should also allow the creation of a network of research centres that can share a specialised infrastructure and exchange useful information and data .
Qimonda is meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of setting up the European Asylum Support Office , as the situation in third countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , is deteriorating all the time .
Mr Severin has excellent mention strategic reciprocity - that Ervopa needs a strong United States and the United States needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this flow of refugees will mean , which percentage of them will be entitled to be included in the resettlement programme .
I very much hope that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will make every effort to abolish this visa .
After all , this problem has not been raised by the food inspector or by the EU Food Safety Authority , but by the enterprise itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we should use our vision of military capabilities with a view to soft power and prevention to tackling the new agenda , which has already existed , but which has become clear in Munich , as President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter the new era of disarmament negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present to you this evening a report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which the Committee on Budgets has already drawn up for a long time .
Members of the MoDo party did not vote in favour of the Barroso nomination as President of the Commission in September , because his performance so far was not to show his re-election .
By reforming our agricultural policy , we can ensure that animal welfare is at the heart of their species &apos; concerns and is strong and relevant , according to the principle that prevention is better than cure .
We are now afraid that , if the scope of this directive is extended , the directive could have the same fate as the last attempt to introduce &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , it will be blocked by the Council .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members who propose that politicians , Member States and the European Union put SMEs at the heart of their efforts for economic recovery .
Countries like the United Kingdom and the US , whose deficit exceeds 10 % , will have to undergo major changes if their public finances are to be renewed .
We should not mix all things together , or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on a new media law , and I do not think that is his job .
It is clear that there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
Furthermore , it would be unacceptable for wine-growers who seek to follow a quality policy , particularly in Prova , to recognise a by-product based on blending two final products and to allow misleading references to rosé wine .
But much more needs to be done .
It will be the case that people will lose jobs throughout Europe and that we will reduce the capacity of our food production .
Let us also realise that , despite these institutional matters , this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is , of course , very affected by the need to move forward on climate change , by the financial crisis , by the concern in Europe that we need a policy for creating jobs - a lot of important issues that need to be resolved .
However , I would like to stress that we are well aware that many of the documents needed for police and judicial cooperation will require a new basis , which will allow Parliament to fulfil its role as colegislator .
I also very much appreciate the fact that the rapporteurs have abandoned this ethical dimension , which will , of course , continue to belong to the Member States .
This is a good thing because , after all , they are precisely young people who will decide on the future of Europe , but on the other hand , we should not forget those who have already contributed significantly to building Europe .
This means that we are doing an economic recovery plan where we are giving 3.5 billion energy oligopolies and not just one euro to partners that we need for green change .
Fishing quotas and the management of fish stocks are essential for preventing overfishing in completely exhaustive fishing stocks in inland waters and oceans .
We would have preferred Parliament &apos;s resources to have been increased rather than by means of an increase in the total budget .
Moreover , this package could show how the European institutions can cooperate responsibly , efficiently and constructively when it comes to such an important area .
I think that the frontloading approach promoted by the Commission in its recast proposal , in other words , improving the first-instance governance , will allow us to make real savings in the medium term .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have prepared a good report and have succeeded in reaching a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to leave European jobs to countries that do not have as high environmental requirements as we do .
All the contributions have benefited from things .
( LT ) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly getting worse .
Considerable efforts must be made to reach an agreement between the 27 Member States , reflecting Europe &apos;s unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and to maintain the heart of European integration .
Madam President , I speak as Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , it was calculated that this money could only be used for two types of projects , both those that aim at reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere , that is to say , carbon capture and storage , and those of wind farms in the North Sea .
Perhaps if the EGAF funds were proposed to be provided to redundant workers in Britain and we would vote in favour of this , we would be criticised for it .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that the Court is fully operational , but still in the plenary .
The programme concerns our neighbours and includes our closest neighbours , such as Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as neighbours other than Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Together with our colleagues , we are committed to the idea of gender mainstreaming being included in all the policies we are going to present .
These projects will help close the gap between systems in the European Union and enable the European Union to use its own energy sources at the moment .
What is more , this approach has a political basis , and I think that Europe needs more policies than anything else - and that is one of our responsibilities as a Parliament .
Another issue is that FIFA has not yet established a technical selection facility , unlike other sports organisations .
In fact , we are capable of organising different types of training or seminars where we can actually help ensure that access to EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas is provided for .
Others are using the fact that we are lacking this policy as an excuse for justifying their bilateral agreements with suppliers , who often ignore the requirements for transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
Moreover , I welcome the fact that we have also managed to establish a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on legislative programming .
Above all , many Member States have worked very hard to fulfil their obligations with regard to the pact .
The objective is to allow the EU to respond to the major social challenges affecting all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone ( demographic ageing and health , energy supply , water and food supply , sustainable development , combating climate change , etc . ) , as well as to develop knowledge enabling our businesses to continue to innovate and enhance their competitiveness .
Although we will support the resolution tomorrow , I believe that there are some irregularities in the budget , and I would like to draw attention to two of them , which I believe are the most serious .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his excellent work .
We will also move on with good governance of the global economy , particularly with regard to financial regulation and early measures following the G20 Summit from Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to address this point in greater detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
The crucial issue is the desire of Europeans not to suffer the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would inevitably arise from accession .
It is ingratible and difficult .
This is the first list of our priorities .
However , support for the EU is essential to ensure the country &apos;s independence .
Following the war crimes committed by the Israeli Government at the beginning of the year , military operations continue to carry out an occupation .
in writing . - ( FR ) The evaluations and repeated visits of expert teams have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to fully join the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal has remained as before the 5 surface long-liners .
an increase in the budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities , which will lead to further arms race ;
I would also like to draw attention to a contradiction between the commitment of the Pakistani Government to freedom of religion and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries &apos; fight against defamation of religion &apos; in the United Nations .
I say this here this afternoon , because I sincerely believe that .
I consider the compromise reached by the Council to be a good one , as it guarantees both equal rights and equal treatment .
Under these circumstances , rapid and coordinated action by European governments and institutions is absolutely essential , with the introduction of programmes for returning old cars to a single amount , financial assistance , etc .
However , the proposed legal basis is , in my opinion , the issue does not seem to be particularly aligned with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which will bring together the powers currently divided between these two pillars .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure &apos; is a question .
If the people working in this sector , from fishermen to the traders who sell fish to consumers , this policy will inevitably fail .
This Parliament , which is a costly and unfruitless discussion club , which is a fine illustration of responsible democracy , is a blatant deception in the voters who sent us here .
That is regrettable , because we seem to have to be united on this issue .
We no longer say that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy 100 % of our industries in Europe , where we fail to do so , because climate change must take precedence .
The burden of debt - painful proof of the economic growth we are seeing - not only in our European countries , but also in the United States .
Moreover , this report will help clarify and work out the various air agreements in as simple a way as possible , and highlights which criteria we should focus on and which aspects we should monitor .
I will vote in favour of the telecoms package , but I do so with some hesitation , because I believe that the main principle of the liberalisation of telecoms , which this directive was intended to achieve , has been fundamentally betrayed .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
Their effect will be more costly and taxpayers will suffer if our efforts are coordinated .
The European Commission is preparing a directive to facilitate the acquisition of visas to Belarusians and a readmission agreement .
Let me give you a concrete example .
Let us look at child education and school training , for example .
Neither do we know whether the standards we uphold on the legal trade will come into force and will apply worldwide - some speakers have already raised this issue .
The establishment of a Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis as an institution for analysing and evaluating the coordination of the measures taken by Member States to promote sustainable quality growth is important .
in writing . - I voted to amend the legislation on vaccination against bluetongue in order to be able to use more effective vaccines and reduce the bureaucratic burden on farmers .
I voted in favour of this report as it calls for the creation of a strong , integrated EU policy .
By abstaining from the vote , I wanted to express my deepest disappointment at the outcome of the summit , which far from meeting our citizens &apos; expectations .
Late payments often cause problems both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
Of course , we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour , but we should not insist that everything remains down to citizens , because they are our only chance to exit from the crisis .
In the United States , the early warning system is working to this end .
One of these cases concerns my constituents , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , our freedoms and our democracy .
Let us act quickly : it was demanded by Europeans when voting for this Parliament , and that is what we need to give them if , in five years &apos; time , we want to go to the elections in greater numbers .
The European Council has discussed and approved the elements of the text for which it is responsible .
The final private consumption of people has increased by more than 80 % than the last decade .
At this stage , I believe that it would be useful to engage in effective thinking about appropriate routes to enforce existing legislation .
The summit &apos;s conclusions in this regard are very vague .
To this end , the proposal offers a single instrument for recovering or precautionary measures in order to avoid problems regarding the recognition and translation of instruments issued in another Member State , and a standardised form of reporting formula for documents relating to debts within the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because they take into account important policy areas and individual positions .
The Commission can encourage cooperation at European level through financial programmes .
For example , the Council &apos;s decision of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 gave Member States the power to cooperate at national and intergovernmental level in carrying out these crimes , and fortunately - we all remember the case of General Pinocheta - even form part of the legislation of certain Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be seen as approval of the EU &apos;s &apos; golden subsidy mine &apos; .
Our purchases are taking place at an ever-increasing distance and our habituality has changed the Internet completely today , inter alia , because our life is becoming increasingly ruined .
As far as information is concerned , we are delivering that as we receive it .
Finally , I would like to say that the best investment is investment in education for the young generation , by which I mean lifelong learning .
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that all these issues have been resolved in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre )
In this case , these were thousands of people , often small children , without adequate funding .
The procedure for interfering in the Commission is completely different from the petitions procedure in Parliament under the provisions of the future treaty .
Human rights must be respected by all the parties to the conflict in the Middle East .
Mr President , the credit crunch in Greece has raised questions about the ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We all have to face up to our responsibilities .
We understand that UNESCO has officially addressed the Chinese authorities in an objection about the impact that this reconstruction will have on Chilean traditional heritage and culture .
in writing . - MEP Schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase vehicle safety by introducing increased safety requirements for car manufacturers .
I therefore voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown our ability to act and we have taken a determined stand on them .
When we talk about what position Parliament is to take on external bodies , for example , human rights organisations , which could be affected by this , and if we fail to reach an agreement , although I hope that this will not happen and if individual projects cannot come into being , I think there is support for Parliament &apos;s opinion here .
This Thursday afternoon &apos;s sitting offers an increasingly surreal direction in this House , both in view of the holidays we are seeing here and in view of the issues under discussion and the way in which they are treated .
I think it is still not clear whether Moldova will manage to elect its president and , if it does not succeed , further elections will probably be held next year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union came into being on 1 January 1999 while , at the same time , 11 EU Member States adopted a single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I too should like to support and welcome this compromise , as it responds to the issue of the democratic deficit suffered by women , in particular , over the years when assisting their self-employed spouses in shelves , small and medium-sized enterprises and in free professions , without the recognition of their work over the years .
Of course , our political decisions are clearly different and sometimes contradict each other .
I would have liked to have seen climate justice because it concerns relations between developing and developed countries , the will to put forward a credible proposal for funding to adapt to climate change and the mitigation of its effects , and the way in which we see our willingness to lead .
I would therefore like to know the Commission &apos;s opinion on this issue .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid provided to the banks , which have benefited from it , but have not taken an appropriate social approach .
Not only do I have three children , but I also have a blank church at present .
We are ready to develop technical assistance programmes which will complement the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities have to implement .
We are waiting for the Commission to present this strategy .
As you said , our statistics still need to be updated , and Eurostat is looking at this .
I sometimes say that we have not learned enough from the lessons we have learnt from the lessons we have had when we are not looking for European solutions to European problems and trying to find something ourselves , even if this is a matter that we should deal with collectively .
E-mails also that scientists who were sceptical about this hypothesis have been pushed out of the professional evaluation process to avoid a lack of research and will be turned away by the public .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has thrown its finger at this very dark section of society we are still contending with and we are dealing with it very hard .
We know what people are proud of here , and the authorities must therefore be aware , when inspecting science , that these people pose a high risk and therefore need to be subject to stricter controls .
Our priority in revising this directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic goods to be sold in the European Union .
Preventive work is carried out mainly in schools , as this social group is most susceptible to drug addiction .
It has successfully expanded to reunite the continent at the end of the Cold War and is now tasked with saving past results and continuing integration before the situation is improved again .
Many Members want to get answers today to their questions , and out of respect we should have the negotiations properly .
But we have known that there is no other option that the problems of the dairy sector must be solved and , hopefully , we are now on the way to solving the problems faced by this part of agriculture .
Secondly , while the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provision , we have abstained from such a reference in this report , as we oppose any family policy being dictated at EU level - it is a matter for national governments to decide .
Finally , I believe that the further talks that we will hold on this subject must address the issue of EUBARafah : how to revitalise this mission and how it might be extended .
That is why the Commission is following the situation and , if necessary , will intervene , but I think we should not go beyond the framework of the structures contained in Community law , and the Commission will definitely be following Community law .
As our common vision is to establish a real European diplomatic service which will not just extend the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations on which we will be discussing today and voting tomorrow are of key importance .
in writing . - Given the ongoing gap between men and women in terms of unemployment levels , salaries and access to managerial positions , I call on the Member States to speed up the application of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC by ensuring its full and effective transposition in national law .
I abstained on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I really want to try and get out of the commissioner the fact that there will now be no further progress until refugees are transferred in the next few weeks .
We will soon address this issue in discussions on the recasting of the first railway package and on the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , Wednesday , 20 October , the European Parliament adopted the report by its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
There is already talk of tax increases in the near future in order to keep public finances in circulation .
The time has come for us to show our voice so that Christians and the supporters of other religions have the freedom to pursue their faith .
In the whole of the European Union , 3.5 % of women ( 30 hours or less a week are working on part-time ) compared to only 8.3 % of men .
I share the cautious optimism of both the Commissioner and the Minister , and I have the feeling that clouds are beginning to disappear , but there are still many of them .
At the moment , only a few of us would be able to estimate the extent of the economic crisis that has come .
Parliament is therefore moving in the right direction and shows that it is on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this excellent report .
This policy has become a key feature of the economic recovery package , as it provides added value and supports efforts to promote modernisation and sustainable economic growth , which also demonstrates European solidarity .
It is also unfortunate that we do not yet know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , and we obviously need to put it into effect without further hesitation .
However , I think that this situation clearly demonstrates the plight of the agricultural sector , at least in my region , if farmers are to wait outside the queues , in the winter months to ensure that there is a huge amount of EU funds .
The Member States of southern Europe have left this too late .
This should be done through smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
On behalf of our citizens , we will show our democratic will ; three is therefore a very important day .
It should be said that housing is an absolute necessity for everyone , particularly in a modern social state .
In my opinion , identifying priorities which are political means and which should be subject to control should be transparent and democratic .
This particular project addresses the deployment of the transport management system .
( HU ) In recent months , Vojvodina has been ruled in northern Serbia by several nationalities living there , but especially between Hungarians , climate fear .
What we are going to vote on today is the result of a compromise - sometimes a difficult compromise - and I think that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved our name on a result that is workable and feasible .
in writing . - We agree with those parts of the proposal which stipulate that Parliament and the Council are on an equal footing with regard to access to information ; that there will be a regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament ; that citizens &apos; initiatives will be subject to cooperation ; that there will be an assessment of their impact ; and that there will be a &apos; soft law &apos; ; rather than a sanction law ?
You all know that there can be no broadcasting without access to Iraqi spectrum , and it is a policy of the European Union to ensure that all market operators have non-discriminatory access to radio spectrum .
This will provide us with an overall and fairly comprehensive framework for the Commission &apos;s activities in terms of progress on equality between men and women , in the areas my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to the next sphere , in which it is important to ensure and guarantee this equality .
We expect other politically and economically important states to submit their offers , but in many cases this has not happened yet .
Dementia and , in particular , Alzheimer &apos;s disease are not only a serious media issue , but also an extremely sensitive one which will continue to grow in the context of Europe &apos;s ageing population .
I also want to say that you have stressed with great care that we should not confuse the different responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to confuse the obligations of the Member States with the responsibilities of the European Union either .
rapporteur . - Mr President , let me first begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs who have dealt with this in detail : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Dahl .
We have given them our hand and , with the full support of all the European institutions , you should take ownership of it in Minsk , because you and the people of Belarus can gain a great deal .
We need to monitor in detail what is happening , because the President said that , thanks to European companies , we would achieve annual savings of EUR 38 billion .
Now , following Mr Liu Xiaobo &apos;s ruling , we have seen the police ban on the weakness of homosexuals , which means that the time for the ice period for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals is in danger in China .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine today was very clear .
We have to acknowledge that this will only happen when involving parliaments , as most of the regulations can only be adapted appropriately through parliaments , and that the process and proposals relating to transatlantic dialogue between legislators and transatlantic assemblies are extremely important .
Someone spoke of the helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , it was a great pleasure to hear your speech .
This is an aspect I would like to highlight with regard to this agreement .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament is today sending a clear signal to all women who are helping their partners in self-employment .
Anyone who was in the aftermath of the Gaza conflict can witness enormous human suffering there .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States of America are the European Union &apos;s most important strategic relations .
I have to say that our ambition is to reach a political consensus on the June European Council .
However , we all know that Europe cannot achieve better results with less money .
On the other hand , a large number of parties took part in Copenhagen , which gives me the hope that such a large number of alliances will have a chance of success .
Mr President , I would like to support the motion against the resolution , because I have heard something very important from Mr Schulz : if we really want this debate to include &apos; Europe &apos; , and not just Italy , there is no point in voting on a resolution called &apos; SvFreedom of Information in Italy &apos; .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
This recommendation by Parliament is proposing to approve a regulation tabled by the Council , without further delay , as this new regulation would simplify the supervision of procedures and guarantee the same treatment for third-country nationals legally residing in the EU in the field of social security .
This is a rather shocking figure , and I said it in the report I produced during the previous parliamentary term .
However , this policy may not be as strange as the appointment of a totally incompetent Baroness Ashton , the kind of Sarah Palina exual left , to the post of High Representative .
One such achievement is the free trade agreement with South Korea signed on 6 October , which is simply the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union , which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 level , as I firmly believe that reduction is needed and their position is weak starting point for the negotiations .
I think we have attached little importance to the development of completely new modes of cars , hydrocarbons , cars and fuel-related cars .
Then our journeys will evolve .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
The European Union , as a partner for Thailand , is ready to support the country as it will only be able to support it during this complex process .
In order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow the creation of jobs and welfare , will actually benefit local populations and does not harm the European fisheries product processing sector and the European canning industry as quickly as possible , it is essential to establish an assessment of its impact and to allow its suspension if necessary .
This is what the European Commission and Parliament are trying to ensure that gas deliveries are restored as quickly as possible ; of course , the expulsion of claims is not a very effective step .
It is essential that Member States urgently investigate extreme violations of the human rights of Roma women , punishing perpetrators and ensuring that all victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) Mr President , this is a fairly complex matter .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation with national supervisors , but also to the importance of cooperation with the national parliaments and , in particular , with the committees on European affairs , the budget and budgetary control .
I would like to ask you to propose and ask you to create a modern organisation that is open to citizens and which will not be understood as a matter that is the preserve of several indigenous diplomats .
All countries are currently doing their economic policy to get out of an unfavourable economic situation , at least for a kind of economic growth .
Let me also mention Japan .
Mr Barroso has reacted by being an internal matter .
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be watered down , but rather protected and reinforced .
It is not a secret that the European identity is drawing directly from Christian traditions .
It is good for big corporations , but it breaks off public transport and causes the underlying rail network and the deterioration of security .
On the other hand , discussions on Turkey &apos;s future membership of the EU must not be left behind .
This risk must be effectively eliminated as it reminds us of the tragic events in Japan .
The main objective of this agreement is to ensure that workers are protected against the risk of suffering all sharp injuries used in health .
In short , I have completed the report , but the work is far from over , not for me and not for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work , and I would like to stress that my group - from the outset - has approached the adoption of SIS II with great caution , given the implications of personal data protection .
We need to establish the right conditions .
in writing . - ( PT ) In 2009 , the Ombudsman registered a total of 3 098 complaints lodged by 2008 , which represents a 9 % drop .
The compulsory retirement age was also decisively rejected by the European Court of Justice in October after reaching the retirement age .
The potential for using EGNOS and GNSS is also an area of security , the environment and road traffic flow , as these can be used to toll collection .
In the area of cohesion , which accounts for nearly one third of the budget , it remains true that this is the only budget area where the estimated error rate exceeds 5 % .
I would , of course , like to thank the rapporteurs for presenting a report which has received a majority support .
I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The proposed way out of the crisis to the green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , aims to expand large business into new profitable sectors rather than protect the environment and meet people &apos;s basic needs .
I therefore share the concern you have expressed that such important objectives may be undermined by national debates or by peculiarities than by what unites us .
I agree with the conditionality for reimbursement of previous authorisations in justified and specified cases where cross-border healthcare involves a patient &apos;s residence in hospital , with at least one night requiring highly specialised and costly medical equipment or represents a particular risk for the patient or the population .
The most important way to guide would be for us , and still remains , to push for a more stringent reduction in emissions of at least 30 % .
Negotiations harm the tense of those who seek to limit environmental damage .
Of course , the visa scandals in the past show how relaxed some states have access to visas .
The people most in rural areas are being left once again to their destiny .
I know that we have sufficient potential to meet these challenges with honour .
- President of the Czech Republic , let me extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
Mr Viktor Orbán did not speak to the groups in the European Parliament as a European politician who strives for consensus and compromise , but as a &apos; champion of populist and nationalistic tone &apos; which &apos; defends the Hungarian people before &apos; attacks &apos; .
Therefore , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I value the report positively and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need Russia &apos;s help to persuade Iran not to run the nuclear bomb .
I totally oppose the idea of prevention bombing and countering NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of Europe &apos;s stability conditions .
Mr President , the Garriga Polledo report is a very important piece of work which will allow us to establish a new financial framework for a competitive and sustainable Europe that supports inclusion .
With this in mind , we will try to establish the conditions under which the fisheries sector will be sustainable and able to develop in the long term .
Certainly , living conditions in the beautiful Arctic are harsh but , at the same time , there can be no doubt that , with new technologies and progress , natural resources in this area will inevitably be used .
Unemployment among young people has reached 20 % as a result of the economic crisis at the beginning of this year , while the number of students leaving school is 17 % , with young people from rural areas most affected .
Today , a very wide range of environmental hallmarks is pending on the market , pictures and texts can be confusing for consumers , from the images of forests containing hazardous substances to saying that they are not neglecting a carbon footprint , and that there are even ecological cars .
in writing . - We opposed this proposal because it intended to shift responsibility for the plight of underdeveloped Third World countries to European countries rather than leave it to those countries themselves .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking your time and abstention , but I do so only once in 10 years &apos; time , so perhaps you will not object to it .
This is a delicate piece of work ; work that needs to change things for the better , and it is simply not sufficiently experienced .
We only approved the repeal of these regulations last year ; consumers were not particularly affected by the producers and are still praising this important change .
I believe that the proposals contained in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only moving towards austerity measures and limiting the social rights of citizens .
We cannot allow a reduction in the common agricultural policy budget because it would mean that agriculture in Europe is probably worth less .
At the same time , however , the rapid closure of such a huge amount of facilities is linked to huge direct and indirect costs if we express economic calculations .
I would therefore like to express my satisfaction with the Commission with negotiating the compromise proposal .
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia , Mr Vali dises Zatlers , it is a great pleasure to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament .
Then the drama has been born .
When it comes to an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigrants can receive us , and when it comes to a readmission agreement - which is the objective - and the EU &apos;s agreements with this third country are therefore strengthened - in which the global approach and philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration are strengthened by the Member States &apos; borders .
We regret that the report does not fully accept our proposals , but we welcome the fact that there is a conclusion that is very close to our heart .
Given that one of the tasks assigned to President Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture is to promote a more competitive agricultural system in a more open global trade environment , I intend to use the presence of the Commissioner in the House to ask him how he sees him as a colleague responsible for agriculture in order to conclude the Doha Round .
The report proposes to simplify monitoring and financial control and improve technical and scientific evaluation through a comparative assessment based on excellence .
The proposals being made here today should be viewed , analysed and understood in this sense .
At the same time , it is necessary to highlight legal and administrative barriers ( legal personality , financial rules and sometimes intellectual property ) , which can discourage many key players from participating in research and SMEs .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will re-examine Directive 2007 / 52 from the aspects it has just mentioned .
I therefore also voted in favour of measures that appreciate corporate social responsibility .
We are seeing that , with regard to the new item we have put together , the issue of transparency , progress has been rather slow , and , with the new regulations on access to documents , those who deal with infringement procedures or those calling for the introduction of infringement procedures are getting under way or starting .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Like my colleague , Charles Tannock , I would like to say that in this Parliament , which is unfortunately always empty this hour , this is not the first time we have discussed the appalling human rights situation in Burma .
The role of society is to act in such a way that women and men can freely choose between two logical choices , each of which has a wider vision , such as a vision of work .
It is currently promoting the consumption of products with a rather limited nutritional value , forcing thousands of livestock farmers who are unable to sell their products on the market , which only produces 50 % of their demand .
It is not yet possible to see clearly all the effects of the current situation on our portfolios and on the development of our activities .
Respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is equally important today - and perhaps more important than ever in the Middle East peace process .
Fossil fuels lead to centralised , hierarchical and inflexible energy distribution .
In this context , I agree with the views expressed by my fellow Members .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency of the EU is halfway through , so it is worth looking at the successes it has achieved so far .
I am of the opinion that the review of the first railway package must identify the problems besetting the Member States , which have received a reasoned opinion from the Commission , along with ways of resolving them .
Israel , in turn , is failing to realise that such a huge military response is feeding the new suicide potential of bombers and , on the first occasion , attracting new casinos .
The Burmese authorities have decided to ignore the protests against the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi , as well as the call for her release by many states and organisations , including the UN Secretary-General , the Secretary-General of ASEAN and a number of ASEAN States , which , in fact , are also a member of Barma .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , has pointed out to us that the guarantee of the European Union budget for the activities of investment banks has reached almost EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , which is also very much in the European Union &apos;s circumstances , which is why , in my opinion , Parliament rightly expects an explanation of the risks associated with this commitment .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but on behalf of Toutside Soini , I would like to ask myself : where are the information about the project that people in all Baltic countries have a right to start building ?
If it were not for the active involvement of the Czech Republic , this decision would never have been taken .
I believe that the information campaign on this is very important .
Since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to guarantee the verification of personal documents held by Kosovo &apos;s inhabitants .
Measures have also been taken in this area and precise rules have been introduced .
Do they want a vision of the federal nations of Europe proposed by Mr Corbett , or do they want a more free market Europe , which my party is supporting ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Patri Toia , on the quality of the report that she is presenting today .
That is not impunity - impunity will continue for many years to come .
It is difficult to find someone who embodies so much .
I am convinced that everyone in Slovenia will agree to an immediate stress test being carried out in Krško .
It is not a good sign that some Member States are not talking about a summit on Thursday at a high level on employment .
We have seen that much has already been done to meet the evaluation criteria , and we ask the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania meet all of the requirements as soon as possible .
Under these conditions , allowing the Moldovan Government to force its citizens to finance precarious European programmes and agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the Single European Sky ( Sky Sky Sky ( SESAR ) research programme , although Moldova is not a member of the European Union , is not a member of cynicism .
By doing so , we are killing two birds with one stone ; on the one hand , this infrastructure could stimulate the European economy and create jobs , and , on the other , could mitigate the consequences of similar crises .
As agreed at the EU-Russia Summit in Chanty-Mansyja , our common objective is to conclude a strategic agreement that will constitute a broad framework for relations between the European Union and Russia for the near future and will help develop possibilities for our relations .
It is now clear that we are still failing to respond to requirements relating to the Mediterranean region and Libya in particular : we need to think more about the fact that perhaps we need to take more initiative to understand what this is about to do , so that we can take consistent action with the Mediterranean .
A substantial proportion of European funds for the implementation of this link are conditional on support from the local population and on gaining funds from private investors in Italy .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , news of the accession process in the Balkan States was published .
For this reason , we have also abstained from voting on the proposals by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on TV1 issues in Portugal , although the Portuguese Communist Party is familiar with its criticism of this situation in Portugal .
The Committee on Development has proposed a reporting regime for individual countries so that multinationals have to report by country .
The key issue dealt with in the report is prostitution and trafficking of women .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to speak directly to you .
I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , when it comes to completing and condemning Mr Mladić and Mr Hadžić , the Court &apos;s work will still not come to an end .
In addition , I ask the Commission to support damages actions against responsible companies carried out by farmers who deliberately shamed their own livestock .
in writing . - ( LT ) I support the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies ( ICT ) to improve the Union &apos;s energy efficiency and make European industry more competitive .
In order to be able to find a solution , we must use the same approach in the future .
However , you know that our message is structural reforms - structural reforms in order to strengthen growth potential in Europe and job creation capacities in Europe are of paramount importance .
Especially during the current global financial crisis , this partnership can be extremely important as it opens up greater opportunities for exchanges in trade , scientific and technological areas to enable us to emerge from this crisis in stronger and more stable positions .
Advergence cannot be tolerated any longer .
in writing . - The approval of the Treaty of Lisbon and its subsequent entry into force mean greater responsibility for Parliament , along with the administrative burden that this entails .
At a time of unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort must be made to ensure that the number of European unemployed or workers does not reach 25 million people by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed together with four other Members of the European Parliament and which half of the European Parliament , one plus , has approved , in order to commit the Council and the Commission to producing a piece of legislation that would really effectively combat corruption .
Mr President , the heads of the European institutions , Mr Buzek , my group is fully signing up to your programme for Parliament and for the functioning of Parliament over the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let these promises be fulfilled !
We believe that it is through such a dialogue that we can help these countries , particularly through greater involvement by civil society .
Although , as a socialist , I do not think that partyrarian is a solution in Sri Lanka &apos;s environment , the Tamil people have the right to resist military oppression .
It is the right time to apply for simpler , less costly measures for small and medium-sized enterprises , which will , of course , lead to more jobs and more growth .
In order to combat this phenomenon , it is very important to adopt uniform security measures within the European Union , including repackaging .
Every time we talk about group claims , we reach a US system , experiences with him and his extremes .
Once the agreement on the extradition of persecuted persons and legal aid concluded between the EU and the United States has come into force , this would mean encouraging cooperation in the area of criminal law , as well as limiting the grey zone , which has allowed flights and extraordinary extradition .
I have three proposals and I would like to ask you all urgently for their support .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has been asked several times to decide in specific cases whether sports activity is a service which has purely social benefits or , on the contrary , covers economic aspects which indicate that it is a service of general economic interest .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is the top priority of this institution , and the citizens must know about this .
Only time will it be a marginal problem and certainly no doubt the positive effects of the directive will prevail .
We have an opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region by modernising the logistics of transportation and supporting co-modality of transport in the same transport chain .
The Member States should be able to decide freely , in a democratic process , whether or not they want to ratify this ILO Convention .
According to Eurostat , in January 2011 , a minimum monthly income was between EUR 123 in Bulgaria , EUR 157 in Romania and EUR 1 758 in Luxembourg .
Perhaps the text that will ultimately be adopted will not be so bad .
In many respects , the Copenhagen Summit was disappointing .
We call on international donors , both government and non-governmental , to end their activities in certain areas , if this bill is passed .
This situation has led to a weakening of the judicial protection of individual rights .
( DE ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
Today , Václav Havel told us that Europe is the homeland of our homeland .
Therefore , if I speak to the police in Slovakia , I am obliged to respond Slovak , even if his mother tongue is Hungarian , despite the fact that I will not understand his reply .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to return once again to one aspect of transatlantic cooperation on police activity and justice in relation to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of banking data from SWIFT to the US .
In 2009 , we saw an alarming rise in the use of different forms of protection of national interests , both in the individual Member States of the European Union and in new developing economies .
In the case of SWIFT , transparency has not been taken seriously - neither by the Commission nor by the Council .
Finally , in the area of politics , it is important that we join the ACP States within the World Trade Organisation .
We have to be very different .
If we succeed in helping bring together even a single abandoned season and a child family , then our work has been meaningful .
Therefore , I would like to talk about the success of the 2020 strategy as one of the most important points , in particular , how inevitable it is for the various institutions of the European Union to cease to compete with one of the most important points and for us to cooperate really with the instruments without which the 2020 strategy objectives will not be realised .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU humanitarian aid strategy .
At the same time , the terrible events in Gaza should make us look at Gaza in a more strategic and long-term way .
Other Indians need to be developed which will help explain what factors affect living standards in the country .
According to health experts , the use of correct drugs to treat a person suffering from this disease may be delayed by a year or so .
Mr Tajani , the Commissioner for Industry and Enterprise , has promised to deal with losses in this sector .
Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four draft decisions which seek the implementation of the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is , in large part , the vote on the position of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent global context , and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the EU must strengthen its strategic autonomy so that it can assert its interests and protect its citizens through a common vision for the major challenges and threats and the interconnection of resources and capabilities , thereby contributing adequately to international peace and global security .
A good time has come in relations between the two parties , and the results of the current global agreement are good .
This will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions , and I hope that this will give the European project greater legitimacy to Europe &apos;s citizens .
I suggest you read the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore ask for a proactive approach .
by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on the strengthening of surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - and , finally ,
However , if we want to successfully address it , we also need to support such actions with major and decisive political measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , that is the last time I will tell you .
I would like these exemptions to be provided at the same time with a clear date or with clear criteria , whether they have any structure - perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to put forward to meet India &apos;s requirements in part .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I heard that everything was done at the Italian Prime Minister , apart from the fact that , thanks to his entrepreneurial activities , tens of thousands of people are in employment .
Whether this is timely or not is , of course , an issue that Parliament should assess itself .
This report therefore serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme , while calling for changes : to change , on the whole , the burdensome administrative and financial regulation and the low performance of this programme , which still makes it far too ineffective for small and medium-sized enterprises at a time when they play an important role in changing the results of research and services , and to ensure better coordination between the various European parties and funding .
It is about the fact that the ECB has chosen the party in the event of the Greek crisis .
This will not lead to our industries becoming uncompetitive .
It called for a total ban on so-called &apos; softening agents &apos; .
Statistical data show that around 4.3 million people die from cardiovascular diseases in Europe every year and over 1.7 million people die from cancer .
Vaccines are the cheapest and most effective measures to protect the public health of Europe &apos;s citizens against contagious diseases , but it is equally important that healthcare reaches developing countries in order to contribute to an increase in life expectancy and combat poverty .
That is why we have to say loud that abuses of the introduction of new rules in the euro area by banks , which so want to increase their profits at the expense of our citizens , are blatant wrongdoing .
We certainly need to ensure , here in the European Parliament , in the current economic situation , that the expenditure is under control .
I therefore believe that increased protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential to European competitiveness .
He has played a very important role in monitoring all the exasperation before the Supreme State Security Court and regularly evaluating the conditions for taking into links in Syria .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters , as well as greater interoperability and coordination between the various Community instruments .
It seemed that all the new Member States would comply with fundamental principles of the EU , such as the prohibition of discrimination , as well as the protection and promotion of linguistic diversity and the rights of national minorities .
Not only is the issue of financial confidence decreasing , but also social confidence .
These new measures should give European citizens and businesses the opportunity to exercise their rights , particularly with regard to the recognition of qualifications , social and residence rights .
The issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not an isolated case .
The Council , in its conclusions , urges the Commission to continue monitoring the situation and , if necessary , to prepare a legislative proposal on bio-waste by 2010 .
Here is a fact : men are entitled to be fully involved in the first days after the birth of the child .
These intentions deserve praise and not criticism , although this is not the case now .
The fact is that we need to put an end to our absolute dependency on the supply of energy from Russia in the EU .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the 11th most important trading partner for the European Union , while trade relations between the European Union and Canada were 1.6 % of total EU trade in 2010 .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the rapporteur who has gone to the Rules of Procedure was Marylène Renault , not I am .
The country &apos;s own fisheries sector is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today &apos;s debate is about four reports , so I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work and the European Commission for their cooperation .
As far as the summit is concerned , I fully agree that this is an important opportunity .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage , which will be applied throughout the EU - and here I refer in particular to Mr Grosch &apos;s remarks - in a uniform and unbureaucratic way without intervening at the existing cooperation between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama said that he was happy to allow the Chinese authorities to study the documents in the archives of his exiled government and to make sure that he did not incite violence .
It is their response to the questions that have hindered their development and their integration into our global world .
in writing . - ( PT ) I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
We are seeing many demagogic and professionally unfounded claims on media websites , but we are on the floor of the European Parliament .
Given that human rights are a key aspect of a binding agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the proposed autonomous trade preferences must be conditional on respect for human rights in that country .
I therefore voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings , which will have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , as it will directly concern the buildings in which they live and enjoy .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position - albeit temporary - for exemptions from the principles on which the European Union is founded , including the four fundamental freedoms .
However , we do not consider it acceptable for this Parliament to make this a request for a higher budget .
It is finally time to put an end to this unilateral privileges of the United States .
Mr Dalli and Commissioner , now that we have this directive , I would like you to be able to focus more closely on the social security regulation , which is a system on which everything is based and which clarifies who is paid and where everything is well organised .
Let us not lose sight of our common objective , and let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
I think this really was needed and it is a good example of this Parliament &apos;s achievements when , to say it in this way , funds were not used in other areas .
Let us now think about the individual hypotheses .
I believe that , as the European Union , we are playing a global leading role in this revolution .
For companies that have chosen to maintain production in Europe , European knowledge and European jobs in sensitive sectors such as clothing , wheeled products and furniture , creating the conditions for consumers to make informed choices is a fundamental issue .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this very destructive form of crime .
The European Neighbourhood Policy has proved to be an effective foreign policy instrument which encourages the strengthening of relations with third countries and brings tangible results .
Moreover , it is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only a right but also a duty to express its opinion .
However , we have broken this threshold with the proposed document , and we have done so because of the need to look after patients .
The Committee on Budgets acknowledges the importance of these proposals and their urgency .
I believe that every patient has the right to receive the quality of care and care provided in his language , close to where he or she lives , close to his family .
When we speak in this House , we have to use the terms accepted by everyone , and FYROM , a candidate country , was accepted as &apos; FYROM &apos; rather than as Macedonia .
This is achievable and will lead to better results .
The recent developments in the European economy , not least with regard to Greece , have shown an urgent and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
That is not all that her sponsor , Stuart Wheeler , said that membership costs us GBP 120 billion a year , about 36times more than in reality .
This double approach to Belarus - the carrot method and stick , I think Mr Tannock called it - may be a success .
We could talk about many other issues - energy , non-proliferation , but I believe it is important that there is a fundamental consensus in these three reports that we have done over the last time .
Secondly , he also said that the Commission should start examining the possibility of implementing Eurobonds - I would say at last .
Situation in Lithuania with regard to the right to the protection of minors against the detrimental effects of public information ( debate )
This is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Entrepreneurs and SMEs
Under this regulation , suppliers must use tyres to use the label and label to provide consumers with information on fuel consumption and on driving resistance , wet grip and external noise .
We fully respect the right of each Member State to decide for itself whether or not to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon .
I also believe that , in order to achieve clearer and more ambitious results , the European Union should give some flexibility to the development of negotiations at the last stage in COP 16 .
It is therefore necessary to take balanced and transparent measures , as the precondition for the success of the project is to win the trust of entrepreneurs .
There is the problem of the disastrous impact of large-scale urbanisation on the environment , particularly in coastal areas and in Spain &apos;s islands , but also elsewhere , such as in the area around Madrid .
It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia monitor the situation very closely and work closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Vice-President of the European Commission .
These processes should include the necessary maintenance and surveillance following shutdown , treatment , storage of waste and spent fuel and decontamination , environmental modernisation of equipment and support in replacing the energy capacity of decommissioning plants with particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I think that is what it is all about .
I come from a country in which , whenever I go to the supermarket , I see a man who manages a wood with wood behind .
For example , there was a whole debate about the selling of fertile land in developing countries and countries that have no arable land - buying is , in itself , a very interesting topic for debate and one , in my opinion , also one of those where we can have a consensus .
However , without a Europe-wide network , the key objectives of the European Union will not be achieved .
In Europe , tobacco is growing from 17 of the 27 Member States , while the governments of all these are providing subsidies .
One of them - English , French or German - will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout the EU .
In Ireland , this topic is very controversial and is one of the key arguments of opponents of the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency has made every effort to reach an agreement , but at the end of the day , it has concluded that this matter must be decided by the European Council .
Although Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that we have a different opinion on some issues .
That is how the Commission will work .
However , it could have been the problems of a one-off nature that could be associated with the transfer of an agency to an administrative building with long-term delays .
The proposed changes will enable less developed Member States , which include Romania in order to acquire eligibility for this fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear how many Members from all sides of the House praise the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
I hardly can say how important both are in the current situation .
Together , we will seek a positive result in the conclusion of the Doha Round in 2010 , because this is extremely important in our efforts to promote recovery and combat protectionism .
This is a rather strange day for me , ladies and gentlemen , because today &apos;s sitting was , after 10 years , a good and fair service here in Brussels last time in my capacity as President .
In terms of efficiency , I also consider it interesting that these delegations accept some consular functions , such as the granting of Schengen visas .
We seem to spend a lot of time on day-to-day debate among ourselves instead of discussing with others , and the result is that we will get through properly .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos;s proposal must be better prepared , which is why Parliament should devote more time to its decision .
Perhaps there are also proposals which do not simply remain with the objectives that are currently under discussion .
All Member States would be far worse off without the European Union and its protective shield .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress on general basic education , reducing poverty and improving access to safe drinking water .
This morning , President Barroso said in hand with the Treaty of Lisbon that the Commission represents the European Union on environmental issues .
It is possible to express an opinion that may even be opposed , even Eurosceptics are allowed , but the final result must be the same .
Lukashenko , who is a abandoned political actor , was able to exploit the programme , enjoying all political and economic benefits , while constantly demonstrating his contempt for democracy and human rights .
Furthermore , according to the same joint declaration , the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude small border agreements between Russia and neighbouring Member States of the European Union which might be interested in this .
This is decisive for the future welfare of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself spoke about the delays in applying our legislation , which must be bridged in many Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of Southern Israel have the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure that their proper recycling not only prevents damage to the environment and health , but also leads to a reduction in the loss of raw materials .
I have to remind you that there is still an international arrest warrant on Umar al-Bashir , a fact which the authorities have ignored in that country .
This letter has also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to present to Parliament a comprehensive report on the first year of operation of the project , and preparatory work has already started .
Mr President , I would have expected you to respond to this .
As far as the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal is basically correct , as it addresses the prohibition and gradual replacement of products which have serious harmful effects on human health .
The main objective of the draft decision is to define the fishing opportunities offered to EU vessels based on existing stocks &apos; surpluses , as well as financial contributions for access rights and sectoral support .
The EU must provide all the help of the new Tunisian Government , enabling the maximum assistance to be given to EU citizens , including the British people who have been on holiday in Tunisia and who are now unable to leave the country .
Ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it is right and appropriate for the island of Taiwan to be transferred to the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , these , too , often fail due to commercial interests or because their management belongs to a certain political environment and indirectly forcing their employees to their gardens .
We cannot coexist in the European Union , while this situation continues , and I therefore believe it is very important that the Commission , the European institutions and all of us make proposals with the same aim of ending this situation .
This is one thing , and as I have committed myself to the preliminary evaluation of all the legislation , I will monitor a certain number of criteria , social , environmental and economic ones .
I therefore voted in favour of the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Fund .
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Georgieva , the fact that here in the European Parliament we are talking about Belarus is very good , but not just talk .
Mr President , I support this proposal and I would like to say a few words about it .
I am also very pleased that East Jerusalem is regarded as the capital of the future Palestinian State or Jerusalem of both states .
The third lesson is that the European Union must equip itself with armament .
There are , however , great differences between regions within the same Member State .
The prevention and eradication of violence against women is a fundamental strategic objective for the progress that our civilisation is seeking .
I look forward to your answers .
On 30 January , the preliminary results of the referendum were announced in 10 southern states and the overwhelming majority of the votes ( 9.5 % ) were in favour of secession .
Personally , I feel that Europe needs a single energy policy in order to avoid too much dependence on resources from one area .
The FVO has also revealed the huge errors in the traceability system that Brazil is using and has exposed the problems for many supplies on the way to the European Union , which have not had the necessary certificates .
We will now gradually take the floor for these eight committees .
That is why I think the most important question now is as follows : how and what can we follow on from the results of the Swedish Presidency ?
In the context of the effects of this crisis , the role of the European Union must be strengthened .
The most important thing for this proposal is to insist that dialogue is mutual , that attention must be paid to and respect the views expressed .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to renew Polish street and urban names in regions where the majority of the population is part of the Polish minority .
All of these measures are interlinked , corresponding to the ambitions set out in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , so we need to achieve this ambitious objective as quickly as possible in order to meet citizens &apos; expectations .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report because it represents a significant improvement in the current situation .
I therefore supported the resolution .
This report aims at greater tolerance of risks , simplifying bureaucratic control mechanisms and greater confidence in both scientific workers and businesses .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I endorse Mr Daul &apos;s comments .
The resolution adopted today emphasises the fact that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operators while respecting their different or specific legal personalities .
As a representative of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission , who has dealt intensively with the cuts from recent weeks in the Mediterranean region , where so many people have fled to Europe before the situation in Africa , but some have failed to do so .
However , this is not the case and the sad example is the situation in Lampedusa .
Israel is bombing and buying ghetto .
It is important to listen to people &apos;s views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
in writing . - The issue of the CAP and global food security is important .
I would like to thank you for a constructive and progressive debate .
This partnership must be based on mutual respect , respect for common commitments and also the values that the European Union respects in the area of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
Equal 3 % of EU GDP and trade surpluses of EUR 35 billion .
In this context , as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , we have tabled an amendment calling - not only within Europe , of course - very strongly on the United States , as the Commissioner is well aware - for export subsidies to be abolished completely quickly in all forms .
Most contributors stressed the need to transform the common agricultural policy into a competitive agricultural policy capable of responding to climate change , ensuring food security and suitable quality requirements and other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on
It is , of course , extremely important for certain urban subsidies to be increased by the European Union , as this is where the greatest potential for the economy and finance lies , because it is cities that have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by the Court of Auditors will not be officially presented until next week in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In order to achieve a 25-40 % reduction in greenhouse gases , as recommended by scientists , and in order to halt the fall in biodiversity , we need significant financial resources .
The only method of carrot and stick , which is the main driving force behind the accession process , can encourage the governments of these countries to concentrate on work and on the reforms that can , once and for all , guarantee stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will concentrate on two reports - given their importance .
For the sake of legal certainty , all those involved must have the same rights and must be obliged to provide information about these rights .
Foreign Affairs and diplomacy are in the area of national sovereignty , which is why we voted against all the reports on this subject .
I am referring to the article to satisfy Mr Weber .
I also applaud the fact that the proposal evaluates the positive constant efforts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what took place today in Greece a few hours ago will not be contagious , and I hope that this will , on the contrary , become the start of a joint effort to create a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have been in touch with Tunisia every hour , as well as with the people of Egypt , with our delegations , whom I pay tribute for what they have to contend with in the last few weeks , and we have also been in direct contact with the government and with services .
Indeed , I believe that this financial instrument is even more important in the light of the financial crisis , as it can help businesses overcome the crisis more effectively , and could in future become a pilot project for creating a more generous energy fund .
These controls were inadequate .
Then we will be able to make an important contribution as Europe , but it cannot be a bottomless pension .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman to Parliament following a draft recommendation to the European Commission in Complaint 676 / 2008 / RT concerning excessive delays in providing an answer to the Commission services of the Ombudsman .
The main progress that this directive has made in relation to current legislation is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare providers and have access to information about the quality and safety of the care they receive .
I would like to reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly and to review the regional programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund with a view to adapting them to the requirements arising from this tragedy .
Following consultation with consumer rights organisations and with business representatives , I understand that we must insist on even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
I said that anyone who is asking this debate is wrong .
This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case commercial ones - and the means at its disposal of parliament , such as hearings , resolutions and oral questions , to take political action to keep informed of the development of these negotiations .
There is no recognition of civil involvement in the area of social cohesion or inter-generational solidarity .
However , the issue of admissibility is correct reform .
Today , this is one of the most serious human rights issues in the European Union .
To this end , adequate financial resources must be made available so that the EU can seize opportunities and use new sources of global competitiveness .
In many countries of Europe , public authorities are aware that when they are in a difficult situation , they usually pay late and very often lead some companies to go bankrupt .
The G20 conference also declared the elimination of tax havens to be one of the key objectives .
There is no such response from the political class .
The dollar is , of course , maintaining its position on global transactions , as it is still permitting certain investment , but the US colossal debt of bullying at the expense of the rest of the world , which is to finance their lifestyle , will increasingly be sparing over the doubts of the ability of the largest economic powers to honour their commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has the right tools and the right measures to fight and victory against those who want to destroy it .
An eloquent example is Iceland which , as long as it was a rich country , was not interested in joining the European Union .
This , Mr Vice-President , is not a new demand .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving everyone in order to ensure a truly high level of local reception .
However , it is a problem that will put the fight against international terrorism into neighbouring countries and regions for as long as the fight in Afghanistan has been going on for so long .
We have to combat fragmentation and I therefore urge Commissioner Andor not to interfere with European Social Fund regulations and not to divide it , as he has ever proposed here in this House .
Of course , it is because of the nature of the point that we cannot get everything we want in the compromise .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and all three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for their constructive approach throughout the budgetary process , which is also demonstrating the very good cooperation we have enjoyed in this work .
The Socialist Group cannot remain indifferent to the recent murders of human rights defenders in Russia .
It would have been better to stress that the negotiations have no open end , which would very positively show the way to a more realistic alternative , one that is privileged partnership .
This is therefore , above all , an American problem which must be resolved in Washington .
Let me also say that we should carry out a reform that gives European universities greater independence and a greater European dimension , opens up to students and researchers and enables dynamic development in a knowledge-based society .
The code that they buy can remain in national reserve and , if the Member States so wish , can be divided later .
I therefore call once again for 25 May , the date of this execution , to be called the International Day of the heroes in the fight against totalitarianism , because the many unknown people who , like Pilecki , have lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms deserve to be recalled .
Let me say a few words about our actions .
If this approach were to become a majority in the next parliamentary term , the peace plan drawn up following the wars in the Balkans would destroy significant funding .
I really hope that they will encourage people to get involved in the EMAS programme ; not because I would like to play with figures or because I would like the EMAS programme to compete with ISO standards , but because I think it is a good programme and could help us meet the sustainability criteria .
( DE ) ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question from Cristian Dan Preda under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have already mentioned , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be very important , and I am sure it will go well .
Monetary dumping and the social consequences that result from it can no longer be tolerated .
Such a step is essential for maintaining an effective neighbourhood policy .
By identifying best practice based on the experience of the Member States , by complying with basic standards such as non-discrimination , fair and equal treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriation , we will lay the foundations of a coherent European policy on this issue .
I am aware that during the consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , representatives of the sheep meat sector defended mandatory origin marking .
I am well aware of the complexity of this issue , Mr Kelly .
Although most countries are facing many economic and financial problems , we must pay particular attention to stopping the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must admit that this report will give rise to a serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own resources system .
Overall , it is therefore easier to meet these requirements .
President of the Commission . - The Commission , like the European Parliament , has a right to express its opinion during the screening process .
For example , the rate of fraud in France and Spain is regarded as &apos; suspiciously low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
Citizens are interested in solving the solution and whether their savings are still secure .
It is therefore important to create a network for the sharing of statistical data across Member States and a platform for coordinating research , which addresses the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s .
I , too , share the view expressed by many colleagues here in Parliament that the greater the greater the European solidarity , the better the relations between the European Union and Russia .
Syria still has a very long way to go to achieve freedom of expression and association .
Much remains to be done to guarantee women equal access to the labour market .
However , I would like to reiterate the need for the proposal to be recast in order to take into account the measures arising from the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
in writing . - ( SV ) We are fully aware of the sustainability of the situation of dairy farmers .
I supported this report because I wanted to emphasise , in particular , one threat that is mentioned : the lack of correct and exhaustive information for consumers on the health characteristics , composition and origin of particular species of fish .
After all , history is full of examples of interventions by the West , which have done more harm than good .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and cannot resolve the issue of crime prevention for several reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a key political event and , contrary to what has just been said , Hamas has , for the first time , agreed that the PLO and Palestinian leadership will act as its negotiating partners .
Countries are standing by and negotiate how they could divide marine tax .
The last sector is particularly important given the problems in energy infrastructure , which ...
In other words , the institutions which have been established to protect us from criminals ( indirectly through training police officers ) end up putting an end to the cold virus accused .
However , taking power from Fidel Castro &apos;s brother Raúl has not led to democratic reforms nor to the release of political prisoners .
Energy efficiency information will also form part of all advertising that includes information on energy consumption and will apply to the price of the product .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are all aware of the Washington Consensus ; you knew it .
In this way , we would also be able to react appropriately to current developments in the place that FRONTEX is already involved in any case .
Finally , I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and very positive approach .
We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this matter and I very much appreciate its support in our efforts to find the most contradictory solution .
Mr Wessberg , in particular , thanks to his practice in private business circles , is a suitable candidate , above all , for striking a balance between EU law and the specific requirements of the market and of European citizens .
So far , this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days .
The number of falsified medicinal products will decrease , and their use will only be safer if these measures succeed in enforcing .
We also have a lesson to learn from Opel &apos;s surface : it is still not too late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automotive sector .
We have taken these steps because , like you , President Obama and I reject false decisions between security and ideals .
Unfortunately , the pact for the euro proposes making wage savings permanent .
Recently , a new investigation began at Manchester airport , and a legal council has now been issued stating that the use of these machines to young people could be a breach of the safety and protection of children because of the final dream .
Moreover , this money is not directly applicable to performers .
In the area of civil aviation , its development and use of EGNOS applications for landing manoeuvres should be encouraged .
Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey operators and related activities ( recast ) - Common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey operators ( recast ) - Sport port State inspections ( recast ) - Conditions and information system for naval carriers &apos; transport requirements - Common Maritime Shipyards - Respect and Information System for Maritime Requirers - Respects - Respects - Respect and Information System for Maritime Requirers - Requirers - Respect of Maritime Requirers - Requirers - Requiree Shibies - Requiree Shibies - Requiree Requiree Shicts - Requiree Shicts - Requiree AC ( Shicts for Maritime Requiree AC ) - Requiree Shicts - Requiree Shicts
in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting in favour of the report on establishing a new microfinance instrument which will help people whose jobs are at risk , set up or develop micro-enterprises .
It is important that , thanks to Mr Vlasák &apos;s report , with which I fully agree , we have made some progress in this regard , and I believe that this report will enable us to define the legal framework of the issue better and to introduce instruments such as urban operational programmes as operational programmes capable of providing cohesion policy with new quality .
In the trialogue negotiations , I clearly understood that the improvements I am promoting on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and efficient energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , it is of paramount importance that self-employed workers are supported and encouraged .
In short , it is not necessary to ask Brussels for them .
Mr President , it is clear to us , Europe and the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , that energy has become an instrument of foreign policy , part of a change that is capable of fomenting conflicts or bringing us together , and that is what concerns us today .
I voted in favour of this report because the food programme , which is being considered here , represents a decisive tool for helping the poor who are suffering greatly during the current economic crisis and lack their basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Industrialised countries , including EU Member States , have at least one state-supported by export credit agencies , which together make up the world &apos;s largest source of state-supported funding for private-sector projects .
We are therefore not voting in favour of the report .
By drawing up this position , we have helped to destroy the common government .
In 2003 , Conseil Français was established by a culmutant ( French Council of Islamic Religion ) and , by that , Mr Sarkozy , the then Minister of the Interior , led Islam to the French authorities .
On this matter , I have already asked the European Commission for an opinion and for consideration of the possibility of establishing a special programme to create equal opportunities for women in science .
It is a struggle to continue to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unrestricted access of end users to services .
Europe &apos;s great politicians and minds have understood very well that the strength that could unite Europe is a common approach to economic problems .
The threshold between freedom and security does not stop at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
I hope that , starting this summer , the Commission will take on a leading role in coordinating strategies in key areas such as support for civil education , career advising and employment choices .
The costs will be borne by the countries of origin .
I am thinking , in particular , of what we can do to make the transport system more sustainable .
The decision to establish dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is particularly important for stability in this area .
We can therefore expect a reactor disaster every 25 years .
In my opinion , this increasing eligibility for housing , such as cofinanced expenditure from the ERDF , must lead to further developments , both medium- and long-term , whether this be about the eligibility of funding or the allocation of funds to certain strategic priorities .
Today is the time to talk again about violations of religious rights in both these countries , this time the rights of Christians .
Climate change , that is one of the biggest threats our planet is facing .
As I expected , of course , considerable emphasis has been placed on human rights , the importance of safeguarding human rights is obviously part of all the dynamic relationships we have and that involve our work .
I must also say that the European Union does not yet have any regulations to regulate air traffic .
Europe , however , is not a prescription for the economic crisis .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur the commitment that the Commission has already made with regard to comitology and optional provisions .
I do not think that any warm words that have been said here today , nor can the Commission change the fact that the European Union is not present in Libya , nor is it able at present to stop the urban or Gaddafi territorial situation .
That is why I think and believe that the European Parliament will approve these two regulations , so it will be a very nice gift for the citizens of the European Union , because they will be able to make a wider choice .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I , too , hope that measures will be approved in the European Council to reassure the markets and to re-establish stability in the euro area , because we should all be interested in this , whether we are members or not .
The funding of pre-accession aid has proved particularly vulnerable to irregularities and fraud .
That is the reason for great joy and thanks .
We therefore call for an end to war and violence by all sides , and we urge the EU to act accordingly .
The world outside Europe is facing this energy challenge .
The energy performance indicators of buildings must form part of advertising for their sale or misuse in the media .
It is imperative to encourage efforts to increase the EU &apos;s investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , incentives for producing alternative , non-traditional forms of energy at local level and to increase the infrastructure to ensure that new energy sources are linked .
A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for an efficient functioning internal market which , in turn , will increase internal demand and economic activity .
Furthermore , we should consider the possibility of creating a rapid response instrument within the framework of a neighbourhood policy that would enable an immediate , flexible response to political changes in partner states , such as the recent case of the Southern Neighbourhood .
I think the fact that someone here in Parliament who supports Serbia has condemned the EULEX mission is actually grotesque .
The problem , then , is that only those Members who are able to see you in your original language are listening to you .
We have lost a lot of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency places emphasis on issues that are worrying our fellow citizens , our voters , the environment and climate change , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because to do our job well , we must be in line with those who voted for us .
The European Union budget cannot serve as a complement to national budgets at a time of austerity measures , as some MEPs are arguing , rather should reflect the complex situation in which the EU Member States find themselves .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Madam President , Commissioner , honourable Members , the Treaty did not give the Council any powers to deal with the Member States &apos; national constitutions .
There can be no incumbent approach .
You can tell me that I am a cynical , but not all students are going to study and not all tourists will delay a limited period .
Is the cause of this situation of the global financial crisis , which has subsequently become an economic crisis , or are we facing our own mistakes and our own negligence and ineffectiveness ?
My second &apos; but &apos; concerns the role of the Belgian Presidency in the post-Lisbon period .
The primary objective of these regimes was to maintain together this vast state of affairs , which is populated by a number of completely different nations .
( PL ) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still faced with its negative consequences .
This is the case in many areas with Japan , but I respect its right , for example , to protect its market in rice and its growers , to pay greater prices than those on the world markets , and to ban massive imports that would destroy the rural population there , just as I respect our economies &apos; right to protect certain sectors of their activity .
( ES ) Mr President , I intend to speak about two terms : coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of the younger people use the Internet .
I therefore intend to reinforce the social priority of this new strategy , as I said when we were discussing the overall policy programme for the next mandate .
Therefore , Commissioner , I will go straight to the problem by asking you what measures - and I am using a number here - the Commission intends to take in the short term to address these shortcomings .
That is what we have been lacking or this has not been presented sufficiently visibly to citizens .
Citizens are not interested in this , quite rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 12 : 10 )
I hope that Parliament will send a strong signal and approve the Muscardini report by a large majority , which I thank , as well as the shadow rapporteur , Mr Susta .
At the same time , Romania supported the open-door policy aimed primarily at strengthening NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
Moreover , I firmly believe that everything must be done to prevent the consequences of the disaster and to restore living conditions .
I am also thinking very clearly about not only the workplace images that are occurring quite often , but also the hazardous substances used in working practices .
In September 2009 , the Council launched a detailed examination by the Council of the proposal to amend the decision on the creation of a European Refugee Fund .
At this time , it is important to take particular account of this island and the outermost regions , which , in addition to their permanent barriers , are now facing the problem of destroying infrastructure and personal , commercial and agricultural assets and , in many cases , are unable to continue their business immediately , particularly in regions that are almost exclusively dependent on tourism , because media presentation of events could discourage potential visits .
Since 9 / 11 , we have not had such a consistent interruption to air traffic with such huge financial losses , and despite the current financial difficulties of all Member States , I would urge them to support plans to help air transport , which simply cannot endure further losses .
At the same time , we have to admit that the level of risk increases for us .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in the Congo is appalling .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to make some small-scale language remarks , or married comments .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
You may want something to happen - you can really want something - but you have to take into account the reality .
Consumer protection organisations prefer binding measures for collective redress mechanisms in all Member States , combined with other options , such as the extension of existing mechanisms for resolving disputes against collective complaints .
The problem is not Cypriot Turks , as some people are saying .
I would like to ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin and not have to undergo long and exaggerating routes to consumer countries .
That is what we must do .
I would really like to know , ladies and gentlemen , where human rights defenders , who , like us , are happy that we have the west of secular and pluralist , while , at the same time , shamefully turning a blind eye to the fact that the Middle East is gradually becoming a place of single religion .
This is already happening and we are in contact with the authorities of these countries .
Mr President , bankers who are squandering our money are despicable , but , Mr Schulz , politicians who are now finishing deficits and debts to the house of the younger generations are simply irresponsible .
I owe that to the French and Czech Presidencies , to the Commission and to the rapporteurs from the various groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to do their bit .
Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament has been good with regard to the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights ; it has indeed been a very cooperative relationship .
We should strive to ensure that the programmes being offered give the greatest possible support to the reforms taking place in these countries in order to bring them closer to the European Union .
It is also very important that all Member States maintain contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information on the availability of healthcare , procedures and documents required .
Then , we felt any events in the Soviet Union to be ideological pressure , and now we are talking , in particular , about trade in absolute human freedom .
Whether this is a private or public fund , this report concerns a very specific matter , namely that Parliament confirms that , firstly , it does not have any legal entitlement to make its deficit subsidised and , secondly , that there will be no interference in such a deficit .
Their faces must certainly be the most expensive since the times of the Trojan fleet on the sea to thousands of ships .
The support which is leading to distortions in competition undermines the future of the European motor industry and has a negative impact both on employment and on technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think there are a few things we should bear in mind in the coming debate .
You have already heard the words of various Members about calling for a firmer Stability and Growth Pact with the reverse voting mechanism .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) In view of everything I have said , I think it is very important to remember the real problems that are at stake .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I would recommend that , today , you all note solidarity with the campaign to end this barbaric ritual of May , that the symbolic of our opposition to this practice .
By making the most important measures , national governments are sidelined by the Commission and the &apos; Trojka &apos; , while the Commission is letting these matters leave national governments .
New Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
Following the Commission &apos;s horror of legal action in the European Court of Justice , Sweden has now allowed the decaBDE .
To those of us who come from rural constituency and also to those who sit in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , it is clear that the situation that many livestock farmers are in is simply unsustainable .
The organisers deserve transparent , comprehensible and accessible information .
I believe that we could support the Chinese people in implementing a harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms during the vote because I believe that , in order to improve budgetary stability in Europe and thus safeguard our future , we must be ambitious and ambitious .
It is also important that the organiser of the initiative - social organisations or NGOs - should clearly and explicitly clarify the subject and objective of initiative , although not necessarily tabling a legislative proposal .
In Latvia , the town of Daul is responsible , where more than 90 % of the population is ruled by Russian talk .
At this point , I would like to applaud the apologies of Prime Minister Jan Fischer and the recent proposal by the Czech Republic Government to adopt a series of measures by 31 December 2009 so that these violations can not be repeated .
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers worldwide .
Now , the effects of globalisation have been overcome completely through the financial and economic crisis , and our artificial response is to adapt the criteria for EGF funding .
This current resolution mentions the declaration of Kosovo &apos;s independence on 17 February 2008 , which has been recognised by 69 Member States , and encourages Member States to cooperate on a common approach to Kosovo , given its planned accession to the EU .
Compared to the other two institutions , Parliament can be seen as a pioneer when it comes to transparency , so I would not make this the top priority , because we are more open than any national parliament with regard to both access to documents and transparency in the session of MEPs .
It was only the domestic gesture of the Italian Minister for Reform Umbert Bosnia .
Your monitoring centre of human rights in Asturias - my region - and many other organisations must be taken seriously .
They vote in favour of Mr Casini &apos;s report .
I am very disappointed at the adoption of this resolution on the ban on pork and beef .
I therefore abstained and will follow closely the ongoing investigations .
However , the European Commission &apos;s figures are not entirely adequate in terms of identifying the measures to be used to punish Member States with the highest rate of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 16.25 )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions in sectors which do not fall within the ETS by 20 % .
On the second question , I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware that AMR regulation requires a multidisciplinary approach .
Yesterday , the trialogue raises a lot of hope of final agreement .
In the coming years , future plans based on an annual growth rate of around 27 % indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal should be adapted so that it has the form of a regulation and not a Council decision .
Many people are asking me what bluefin ACTA means , and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because EU financial assistance will help people who have been victims of globalisation find work and return to the labour market , and will help them escape from the walls of recession .
Given that the Internet is the main tool for creating better conditions and developing and knowledge for citizens in the cultural field , particularly through broadcasting audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in radio spectrum and in creating development and innovation software .
All this will redouble the common concerns about the cultural and geographical disparities between Turkey and Europe , and the problems that would be caused by the adoption of a country which shares a border with more than 80 million inhabitants : factors that will continue to strengthen my unbearable belief that Turkey is not right to join a Europe whose unity depends , above all , on the Christian spirit .
Thank you , Mr President .
( Interjests from the floor )
This means going against the environment and consumer safety , because old energy intensive and potentially hazardous energy should be returned to the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate .
I wanted to express my thanks to my mayor , Mr Balingen , Dr Residen , and the local Council for allowing the memory of the lives of these young men .
Thirdly , I urge Mrs Kroes to speed up the digitisation in Member States if we want to be proud of this major flagship project in the future .
Anyone who has experienced and seen the consequences of the environmental disaster caused by the failure of the technology in Baia Mare , with subsequent release of toxic cyanide flows to water flows with far-reaching effects on living fallout of the Tisza rivers in Hungary , but also the Danube Region to Bulgaria , would do everything to prevent a repeat themselves in the European Union .
This is a task for each of us : it is a task for the Member States , for the Commission , for the Council and for Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries EUR 100 billion a year .
Secondly , displaced persons have the right to return to their homes and to their property - the fundamental freedom of movement , as you said , is the freedom to cross the divide .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which proposes rejecting the Commission &apos;s proposal .
What is important is that we have found the courage to convene that we have invited the social partners to do so in the long term - three cumbers will be held in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague before this summit - and that we will try to come to the conclusions that will be valuable for the June Council .
In fact , at first reading , the European Parliament has set a good basis for the correct application of the rules on cross-border healthcare provision in the Member States so that patients can use the necessary ambulanic or hospital treatment in another Member State in justified cases when complying with the rules laid down and without burdens on courts .
This coordination was also proposed in the Barnier report , but we have not yet reached any conclusion .
Time is running out .
Once again , we are faced with the disgraceful attempt by the European Union to interfere in Venezuela &apos;s matter by further grotesque distortions of reality .
At the end of 2009 , the Commission published a consultation document containing new data , but also the views of the various types of users on this subject , and I am now talking about some of the results of this public consultation .
Thank you for taking part .
I would just add that , if a person is detained , this is a right enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights .
I hope that this amendment will receive a majority tomorrow .
The Copenhagen Summit is the basis for further clarification of the Union &apos;s positions with regard to these key elements , allowing us to maintain our leadership and helping us to make Copenhagen a success .
Secondly , at this stage , the Commission does not have clear answers to many of the issues raised by honourable Members , such as territorial avenues , scope or existence of regions falling under Objective 2 , the basis for appropriate funding , the transitional agreement or the position of individual regions .
Secondly , the promotion of human rights is a priority of the Stockholm Programme which lays down strategic guidelines for the development of an area of freedom , security and justice in Europe .
in writing . - ( SV ) Once again , we have chosen to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to help a total of around 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering from the effects of the economic crisis and this extraordinary period requires extraordinary measures .
These studies should lead to the Commission &apos;s absence if its activities prove to be useless , redundant or costly .
The Arab League &apos;s plans and the Saudi Arabia peace plan envisage the end of the violence by recognising Israel &apos;s rights .
The EU must work to ensure that the poorest countries receive a higher level of effective assistance and , if necessary , that their debts are also provided .
