Closure of the sitting
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The debate is closed .
Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .

President of the Commission . - Mr President , the G20 Summit in London will be a key step in the global response to the global crisis .
The conclusions of the report that we are discussing on Wednesday in the European Parliament show that the import of agricultural products from third countries has a much more harmful impact on the environment than internal production , subject to stricter rules on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions , and contributes to climate change .
Indeed , it is difficult to accept that the countries to which such funds are paid out cannot use them .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
The maritime institutions of the Member States must work much more closely together to harmonise training programmes , as well as to offer paid work opportunities and exchange experiences with European maritime companies .
The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of storm Xynthia in Europe .
What we see is that we are increasingly demanding of our farmers .
Frontex must be strengthened and the European Union must oblige the national authorities to shoulder their responsibilities .
I would like to add something to which no one has referred so far , except Commissioner Almunia .
in writing . - ( RO ) Areas which may suffer the effects of climate change are , above all , the following areas : water resources , agriculture , energy , forestry and biodiversity and , last but not least , the health of the population .
Sixthly , my own personal friend and the Commission , the death of nine soldiers and a Turkish policemwoman following the terrorist attacks last week .
Commissioner , congratulations on everything you are doing .
However , the Committee on Culture and Education has opposed resistance , expressing the concern that policies in its areas of competence may be devalued , especially now that unemployment is on the increase and causes problems in many EU Member States , and I am pleased that the necessary amendments have been tabled in the case of Article 1502 on lifelong learning , which I have given my vote , and the required increase in the appropriations ( for example , in the case of Article 1502 ) on the subject of permanent learning programmes .
A totally different political minority government has replaced it , but no one has called it a coup d &apos;état .
The international community was irresponsible to turn attention to the referendum and the Abyei issue remained unresolved .
The case of the Romanian pupils Marian Cozma , who have been brutally murdered by two members of the Hungarian Roma community , shows to us once again that crime does not know borders and ignore the problems of this community is counterproductive .
We need a sound food policy at EU level .
The Treaty of Lisbon should be a new political model in Europe , both with regard to the need to pool the resources of the states in order to achieve the maximum results , both in order to work on common strategies and transactions that make Europe a political Union and with its founding fathers .
That is the demand that we make .
We are all , as Hungary has been since the beginning , supporters of the Single Market .
The inexorable climate change is forcing European Union society and the European Union &apos;s economy to adapt to a new reality .
Individual countries will continue to promote internal stability and find socio-economic solutions and solutions to ethnic tensions .
It was a wonderful story of love , lasting three years , and as part of the short-term love stories , I am pleased to see you come to an end .
It is essential that NATO maintains constant supervision and that it be supported in this work , especially in Afghanistan .
Whatever happens , it is our job to unblock the situation .
In this respect , a number of common aspects , such as reduced VAT rates , exemptions from the system , will have to be addressed , the option to establish a minimum rate and , in fungst , the impositive location of intra-European supplies .
Let me say a few words about the West Midlands region : unemployment among young people is the highest and the automotive industry has been decimated , partly due to the funds that the European Union has provided for the creation of jobs in Slovakia , to the detriment of key positions at the Ryton plant .
It is vitally important to ensure that these institutions are not under pressure to weaken or drop the basic rules for reforming the financial sector .
It is time to stop it .
This also requires the creation of a network of research centres that can jointly use specialised infrastructure and exchange information and data useful to their activities .
Qimonda corresponds to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
in writing . - I very much welcome the idea of establishing a European Asylum Support Office , given the continuing deterioration of the situation in third countries , especially in Africa and the Middle East .
Mr Severin has noted very well the strategic reciprocity , indicating that Europe needs strong United States and that the United States needs a strong Europe .
I would therefore like to ask the Council to make it clear to us that these migrant flows in terms of quotas can be included in the resettlement programme .
I firmly believe that in the near future , the Canadian authorities will make every effort to remove visas .
The case was not brought to light by the intervention of a food inspector or or an agency for food security in the European Union , but thanks to the company itself .
Belarus ( debate )
For this reason , we must use our vision of military capabilities with a focus on light power and prevention in order to define a new agenda , which already existed , but which only existed in Munich , given that President Obama &apos;s policies allow us to enter a new era of negotiations on disarmament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to present this evening the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been ready for a long time now to the Committee on Budgets .
In September , the members of the Democratic Movement did not vote in favour of the appointment of President Barroso as President of the Commission , because his curriculum was not such that his re-election was recommended .
By reorganising our agricultural policy , we can focus on animal welfare , adapting their living conditions to their species and ensuring that they grow healthy and strengthen , in line with the principle of prevention is better than cure .
We fear that if the scope of the directive is extended , it would suffer the same fate as the last attempt to introduce the &apos; made in &apos; origin marking - in other words , the Council would once again be blocked .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to join my fellow Members in proposing that politicians , Member States and the Union place small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their economic recovery efforts .
Countries like Britain and the United States , both with deficits that exceed 10 % , will have to make significant adjustments to restore the sustainability of public finances .
We should keep these two separate things separate , otherwise Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary , and I do not believe that it will .
It is clear that there is also freedom of expression in China .
- Report : Jean-Marie Cavada
In addition to the insult to wine growers who work for a quality policy , especially in Provence , it would be unacceptable to legitimise an underground from mixing other finished products and to authorise their misleading reference to the colour of rosé wine .
There are also very many other initiatives to be taken .
The result for the European rural world would be job losses and the reduction of food production capacity .
Let us also remember that , despite the institutional issues , this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is deeply embedded by the need to continue work on climate change , to continue the fight against the financial crisis , to address the concern in Europe , because we need a policy to create jobs , a number of important issues that need to be addressed .
However , we know that a series of texts necessary for police and judicial cooperation must be equipped with new foundations so that Parliament can fulfil its role as colegislator .
I congratulate the rapporteurs on excluding the ethical element which will , of course , fall within the competence of the Member States .
This is good because it is young people who , after all , decide the future of Europe , but we must also remember those who have already made a very valuable contribution to European integration .
In other words , we are drawing up an economic recovery plan in which EUR 3.5 billion is allocated to the oligarchy of energy giants and not just a single euro to the partners , which is crucial to making a change to the green economy .
Fish quotas and the management of stocks are indispensable in order to prevent excessive exploitation of internal waters and oceans .
We would have preferred Parliament to have withdrawn its budget by not increasing its total amount , but by implementing a redistribution of resources or increasing their efficiency .
In addition , the package could prove that the European institutions are able to cooperate responsibly , efficiently and constructively in such an important field .
The approach based on front loading , therefore , on finalising the procedures for the first instance , which the Commission has favoured in its proposal for a recast , will , in my opinion , enable us to achieve real economies of scale in the medium term .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we produced a good report and we managed to reach a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading .
We do not want to outsource European jobs to countries that do not have the same environmental requirements .
All the contributions were useful .
( LT ) Mr President , the human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating .
We must work hard to achieve agreement between 27 Member States by reflecting Europe &apos;s unity and the will to overcome the crisis by maintaining the essence of European integration .
Madam President , I rise as the Vice-President of the European Parliament for Democracy and Human Rights and would like to start by thanking Mrs Andrikienfor her excellent report .
Tourism is undoubtedly one of the economic sectors with the greatest potential for development .
At that time , the envelope was devoted to just two types of carbon dioxide projects in the atmosphere , namely carbon capture and storage , and wind parks in the North Sea .
If we were to propose to allocate money from the EGF to British redundant workers , we would be voting in favour of this and we would be criticised if we did not .
As far as the Court &apos;s activities are concerned , we know that it is in full operation , albeit at the beginning .
It cooperates with both our neighbours and even neighbouring countries , such as Belarus , Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova , and countries that are further away , such as the Republic of Armenia , the Republic of Azerbaijan and Georgia .
Together with my colleagues from the Commission , I have made a commitment that gender issues should be integrated into all the policies that we will be presenting .
Such projects will also help eliminate differences in connections between the various systems of the European Union and continue to make the best use of EU &apos;s own energy sources .
Moreover , this approach is about policy making , which certainly falls within the scope of Parliament &apos;s remit and , in my opinion , is the most necessary element of Europe .
The issue of FIFA &apos;s failure to introduce &apos; theoretologist online target &apos; , which has already been adopted in other sport , should also be considered .
After all , we can organise various types of training or laboratories through which real help can be provided to encourage access to EU funds intended for the development of rural areas .
There are others who use the lack of such a policy as an excuse to justify bilateral agreements with suppliers who often surpass the requirements of transparency and fair competition , not to mention European solidarity .
In addition , I welcome the fact that we have also managed to create a closer working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the area of legislative programming .
In particular , many Member States have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations .
The aim is to enable the European Union to respond to the major social challenges that concern all Member States and which are unable to respond alone ( ageing population and health , energy , hydrogen and food , sustainable development , climate change and so on ) , as to enable our businesses to become more innovative and competitive .
Even if we support the resolution tomorrow , I must point out that there are two inconsistencies in the budget , and I would like to touch on two issues that seem particularly detrimental to me .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would very much like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Csibi , for his magnificent work .
The issues related to global economic governance will also be dealt with , namely the Financial Regulation and the timely follow-up to the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh .
However , I would like to discuss this in more detail .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in global trade patterns and to assist them in their reintegration into the labour market .
At the beginning , there is a desire for European citizens who are no longer prepared to accept the consequences of the freedom of establishment that would inevitably result from accession .
This is a difficult and unthankful task .
That is the first of our priorities .
To ensure the independence of Kyrgyzstan , EU support is essential .
The Israeli Government continues its efforts to colonise forced tapping after committing genuine war crimes at the beginning of the year .
The additional evaluations and visits of teams of experts have shown that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to participate fully in the Schengen area .
Adjournment of the session
Portugal maintains its five long-liners .
the increase in budgets in these areas and the creation of new military capabilities which will contribute to a new arms race ;
I would like to stress the contradiction between the Pakistani Government &apos;s commitment to ensuring freedom of religion and its dominant role in organising Islamic countries in supporting the &apos; fight against the defamation of religion &apos; within the United Nations .
I say that this afternoon because I honestly think that .
I believe that the compromise reached by the Council is a good thing , because it guarantees equality of rights and equal treatment .
Under these circumstances , rapid and coordinated action by the European governments and institutions is an absolute necessity , for example , by introducing programmes that provide for the scrapping of old cars in the face of a significant drop in the purchase price of a new , financial assistance and so on .
In my opinion , the proposed legal basis is correct , but it does not seem very consistent with an extremely important fact such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which will involve strengthening the functions and powers that are currently being distributed between the two pillars .
Madam President , &apos; success or failure &apos; , that is the problem .
Such a policy will fail if those operating in the fisheries sector - from fishermen to direct contact with consumers - do not comply with the law .
This expensive factory of inconclusive words , which is Parliament , is overtaken by the illusions of responsible democracy , is , in fact , appalling the voters who sent us here .
This is regrettable , because it seems to me that we should be united on this subject .
We are no longer saying that the liberalisation of trade and the fight against climate change will destroy the whole of the industry in Europe where , in a way , the problem does not affect us , because it is nevertheless the climate factor that must prevail .
The burden of debt - and we are seeing the painful demonstration of this - hinders economic growth , not only in European countries , but also in the United States .
In addition , the report helps clarify the various agreements and prepare them in the simplest way ; it finds out the criteria that need to be applied and the issues to be kept in line with them .
I am going to vote in favour of the telecoms package , albeit with some reluctance , because I believe that at the highest level , an essential translation of the basic principle of the liberalisation of telecoms that this directive should have upheld has been used .
( PT ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , we are facing an unprecedented crisis .
These measures are intended to have a greater impact at a lower cost for taxpayers if we can coordinate our efforts .
The European Commission is preparing a directive which will simplify the obtaining of Community visas for Belarusians , as well as an agreement on returning them .
Let me give you a specific example .
Let us look at children &apos;s school and education , for example .
We do not yet know whether the requirements that we want to impose on the legal trade in timber will come into force and will be implemented throughout the world .
The establishment of the Special Committee on the Financial and Economic Crisis as a body to analyse and evaluate the coordination of measures taken by the Member States in order to promote sustainable quality growth is essential .
I voted to amend the rules on vaccination against bluetongue in order to enable the use of more effective vaccines and reduce the bureaucratic burden on farmers .
I voted in favour of this report because it calls for strong , integrated EU policies to be drafted .
I was very disappointed by the result of the summit , which was certainly not up to the citizens &apos; expectations .
Late payments often cause difficulties both in the internal market and in cross-border trade .
We all agree with the need for a policy of rigour and budgetary responsibility , but we must not throw all the consequences on citizens , which is our only opportunity to emerge from this crisis with full control of the situation .
The United States has an early warning system for this .
One of these cases is a constituent of my college , Andrew Symeou .
Together , we must defend our rights , our freedoms , our democracy .
Look at things : that was the request made by European citizens by the election of the current Parliament , and that is what we must give them if we want to increase the turnout of the ballot box in five years &apos; time .
The parts of the text for which the European Council is competent were discussed and agreed by the European Council itself .
The expenditure on private consumption was increased by more than 80 % over the last ten years .
At the moment , I think it would be useful , on the contrary , to start thinking effectively about how the existing legislation should be applied .
The conclusions of the summit on this subject are very vague .
In this respect , the proposal offers uniform securities for the adoption of enforcement or precautionary measures in order to avoid problems linked to the recognition and translation of instruments issued by other Member States , and a standard form of notification of documents relating to debts within the territory of another Member State .
I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because they take account of important policy areas and of personal opinions .
The Commission can support Member States with financial programmes to cooperate at European level .
For example , the decisions of the Council of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 offered Member States the opportunity to cooperate at national level in order to prosecute these crimes , which fortunately are , and we all recall the case of General Pinochet , even part of the legislation in some Member States .
Thank you .
My vote should not be interpreted as support for the policy of &apos; easy subsidy &apos; of the European Union .
Our purchasers are increasingly distant and the Internet has changed our habits completely , not least because of a life that has become increasingly frective .
As far as information is concerned , we are constantly reporting on the updates that we receive .
To conclude , I would like to say that the best investment is made in the education of young generations , and by that I mean lifelong learning .
We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
I am pleased that these issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council .
( Applause from the centre left )
In this case , thousands of people are involved , often accompanied by small and bail-out children .
The procedures are completely different when it comes to the Commission under the new treaty as regards the procedure for petitions in the European Parliament .
Human rights must be respected by all sides of the Middle East conflict .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
We must all shoulder our responsibilities .
However , we know that UNESCO has submitted representations to the Chinese authorities with regard to the impact of urban renewal programmes on Kashgar &apos;s traditional cultural and cultural heritage .
Mr Schwab has proposed a report aimed at improving vehicle safety by imposing more requirements on car manufacturers as regards safety measures .
For these reasons , I voted against this report .
The economic and financial crisis has hit us hard , but we have shown that we are able to act and we have strengthened our resistance .
If we are talking about Parliament &apos;s position with regard to external bodies , for example , human rights organisations that could be affected if we do not reach an agreement , but I hope that this will not happen , and if it is not possible to implement individual projects , then I believe that there is support and understanding of Parliament &apos;s position .
Thursday afternoon &apos;s sittings are taking on increasingly surreal connotices in this House , both because of the vacuity we feel , and because of the arguments and ways in which they are addressed .
It is not clear whether Moldova will be able to elect a president , and if that does not happen , it will , of course , face new elections next year .
in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Economic and Monetary Union began on 1 January 1999 and , at the same time , 11 Member States of the European Union adopted the single currency .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , should like to support and welcome the current compromise , as it raises the issue of the democratic deficit that women have been the victims of for years , although they have worked together with seafarers in the management of their business activities in the field of trade , craftspeople , small and medium-sized enterprises and free professions , without having enjoyed years of recognition of their work .
We know that our political choices are diametrically opposed and sometimes conflicting .
I would like to call it climate justice , because it is the relationship between developed and developing countries that we want to come up with a credible proposal for financing both reduction measures and adaptation to climate change , and how we show that we are ready to lead this process .
I would therefore like to know the Commission &apos;s position on this point .
I would like to remind everyone of the State aid granted to the banks , which have benefited but which , in return , have not taken a social approach .
I have not only three children , but I also have a grandchildren who , at the moment , are not only bowing to milk , as it is the only one who can interfere .
We are prepared to support technical assistance programmes that accompany the difficult austerity measures that the Greek authorities are being called upon to implement .
Let us wait for the Commission &apos;s project .
As has been said , we always need to update our statistics and Eurostat is working on them .
Sometimes I wonder whether we have not learned enough about the lessons of our work , when we do not apply European solutions to European problems , and let us try to find something specific to this , even if we do so in a College .
From e-mails , it is clear that scientists who oppose this have been removed from equal review procedures in order to prevent errors from being revealed to the public .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I welcome this timely debate .
Perhaps the Internet has only had the effect of shaping light on a very obscure part of our society , part with which we still have to do the bills and make them worse .
We know with those who do what we do here , and it is therefore necessary for the institutions to realise that these are situations where we need more inspections in certain plants .
During the work of revising the RoHS Directive , our priority was to raise safety standards for electrical and electronic equipment and electronic devices sold in the European Union .
Prevention work is carried out mainly in schools , as this group is the most vulnerable to drug addiction .
The EU was successfully expanded by bringing the continent together at the end of the Cold War , and it is now called on to defend past achievements and to continue integration once the crisis has emerged .
This evening , there are many colleagues who wish to have answers to their questions and , with respect to them , we would like to move things forward in a normal way .
However , those of us who were involved knew that there was no alternative , that there was a need to resolve the problems of that particular sector , and we hope that some of them will be resolved .
Secondly , although the ECR Group fully supports the need for provisions to protect maternity and paternity protection , we have chosen to abstain from this report because we are against any family policy that is imposed at EU level ; that is a matter for national governments to decide on .
Last but not least , I believe that in the forthcoming discussions on this subject , we will have to deal with the EUBAM mission mission , just as we can give it new life and perhaps expand it .
The Commission is therefore monitoring the situation and , if necessary , will act accordingly , but I believe that the limits of Community law must not be overcome and that the Commission will certainly be subject to European legislation .
Our common hope is that a genuine European External Action Service will be born , which is not simply the sum of the diplomas of the 27 Member States , and that is why the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations that we are discussing today and the vote on tomorrow are of paramount importance .
in writing . - In view of the continuing gap between men and women in terms of employment , salaries and access to managerial positions , I would like to call on the Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002 / 73 / EC and , at the same time , to ensure that national laws ensure that the related provisions are fully and fully implemented .
I abstained from voting on the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission .
I would like the Commissioner to make it clear that , in the coming weeks , there will be no further progress unless the fugitives are brought to justice .
We will address this in the short term , during the debate on the revision of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport .
Today , Wednesday , 20 October , the European Parliament adopted the report of the special committee on the financial , economic and social crisis .
We are already talking about further increases in taxes , in the near future , in order to bring public finances back to the table .
Today , it is time to expressly request that Christians and believers of other religions be free to practise their beliefs .
In the European Union , 31.5 % of women work part-time ( at least 30 hours ) compared to 8.3 % of men .
I share the caution expressed by both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council , and I can tell you that the sky is reasserting itself , even though many black clouds remain .
At the time , a few of us could have imagined the extent of the economic crisis that has hit us .
Parliament therefore moves in the right direction , demonstrating that it is on the side of consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent report .
This policy has become a key aspect of the economic recovery package , which can provide added value and support efforts to modernise and sustainable economic growth , while demonstrating European solidarity .
I also regret that we do not know whether and when the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force , and it is clear that we need to move in this direction without hesitation .
However , I believe that the situation clearly demonstrates the extremely poor state of agriculture , at least in my region , as farmers must make a shortage of days in the winter months , in an attempt to secure modest sums of EU funding .
The countries of southern Europe have waited too long .
These measures must be developed through smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , as stated in the Europe 2020 strategy .
We will vote on behalf of our citizens with a democratic vote , so tomorrow &apos;s day will be crucial .
It is clear that housing is an absolute necessity for all of us , especially in the modern social state .
In my opinion , the political priorities to be defined must be evaluated and must be made transparent and democratic .
This specific project concerns the installation of the traffic management system .
( HU ) Over the last few months , in Vojvodina , in the north of Serbia , there has still been a climate of fear among the various peoples living in this area , mostly Hungarians .
What we will be voting on today is the result of a compromise that is sometimes difficult , and I understand that Mr Lamassoure and the other rapporteurs have achieved something that is achievable and achievable for us .
in writing . - Although we endorse the parts of the proposal which include equal treatment of Parliament and the Council on access to meetings and information ; regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament ; cooperation on citizens &apos; initiatives ; and an assessment of the impact of the legislation ; and the adoption of &apos; soft law &apos; rather than punitive laws ; and , rather , of course , cooperation on the application of the directives , and on the basis of the application of the application of the application of the directives , and of the application of the application of the Commission , of the application of any confirmation of the Commission ?
You are all aware that access to radio spectrum is necessary for any transmission , and the spectrum that European policy wants to provide indiscriminate access to all operators on the market .
This will provide us with a comprehensive and fairly comprehensive framework for the action of the Commission on equality between men and women in the areas that my fellow Member has just mentioned , from employment to the other contexts where it is important to ensure and ensure equality .
Let us hope that the others , too , will make their offers available to them , because many of them have not been the case so far .
Dementia and Alzheimer &apos;s disease in particular are not only serious medical problems , but also a highly sensitive social and ethical issue , the seriousness of which will increase in parallel with the ageing population of Europe .
I would also like to add that you have paid great attention to the fact that we should not be confusing the various responsibilities , and I certainly do not want to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union either .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , who have addressed the details of this matter : Mr Szájer , Mr Duff , Mr Frassoni and Mr Dahl .
We have brought our hand to bear and , with the full support of all the European institutions , we call on Minsk to tighten it up , because in doing so Belarus and its people have a lot to gain .
We must keep a close eye on what is happening because the President said that we would save EUR 38 billion annually from European companies .
Now , as a result of the sentence against Liu Xiaobo , we have also seen the police prevent homosexual demonstrations , with the clear threat of transposing itself into an appalling era for the policy for dissidents , human rights defenders and homosexuals .
( SL ) Commissioner , your report on Ukraine has been very clear today .
At this point , we must recognise that we will only be able to achieve this objective if the parliaments are involved , because it is only through Parliament that the majority of the legislation can be adequately adapted , and the proposals related to the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance .
Some have spoken of helicopters .
Madam President , Commissioner , I was pleased to see you and listen to your speech .
That is the point of the agreement that I would like to highlight .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today the European Parliament is sending a strong message to women who help spouses in their self-employed activities .
Anyone who was in Gaza after the conflict is witnessing the enormous suffering of the people .
( ES ) Madam President , relations with the United States are the most important strategic ones for the European Union .
I must say that our ambition is to reach a political agreement at the June European Council .
However , we all know that the European Union cannot multiply and improve its actions with more limited resources .
At the same time , the large number of participants at the Copenhagen Summit gives me hope that the action of such a large number of allies will be more likely to be successful .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I rise in favour of the voting proposal to avoid the resolution because , in Mr Schultz &apos;s words , there is no point in voting for a very important resolution : if we really want this debate on the subject of &apos; Europe &apos; , and if we do not want to restrict it to Italy , then there is no point in voting on a resolution entitled &apos; Freedom of Information &apos; in Italy .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
Parliament &apos;s recommendation that the Council should be adopted and that it should not be postponed as well , because this new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals who are legally resident in the social field .
This is rather appalling , and I have also mentioned this in a report that I produced in the last parliamentary term .
However , an EU Arctic policy is perhaps not as shameful as the appointment of the extremely unqualified High Representative of the extremely unqualified Baroness Ashton , Sarah Palin from the former student left .
For example , a success is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October , which , quite simply , is the most ambitious trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union , and which must remain a point of reference for future bilateral trade agreements .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels , because I firmly believe that we need to reduce the budget , and the position adopted is a weak starting point for negotiation .
As far as the car industry is concerned , I believe that we have largely overlooked the development aspect of completely new types of cars , which are fuelled by hydrogen cars , batteries or fuel cells .
Then we will all continue in the process .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Badia i Cutchet for the own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union .
As a partner of Thailand , the European Union is ready to support Thailand as far as possible throughout the whole process .
In fact , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs and prosperity , would be of real benefit to local populations , and that it does not harm European industry for processing and the breeding of fishery products , should be carried out quickly and that its impact has been suspended if necessary .
That is what the Commission and the Council are doing at the moment in a genuinely commendable way to ensure that the gas supply returns as soon as possible ; threatening legal action is not , of course , a very effective approach .
It is imperative that Member States investigate without delay the extremely serious human rights violations committed against Roma women , punish those who have committed themselves to such crimes and ensure that all the victims are identified and compensated .
( LT ) Mr President , this is indeed a rather complex issue .
I would like to draw your attention to the importance of collaboration with national audit bodies , as well as to cooperation with national parliaments , which no one has yet mentioned , and in particular with the committees responsible for EU affairs , budgets and budgetary control .
My suggestion is this : now that the European External Action Service is regulating its access to information and documents , making it a modern organisation accessible to citizens who do not deal with foreign policy as if it were solely the prerogative of some diplomats .
All countries are reviewing their economic policies in an attempt to get out of this unfavourable situation as soon as possible and to return to economic growth .
I would also like to make a statement about the Japanese people .
Mr Barroso said to me that these are internal problems .
We therefore recognise those who oppose its weakening and , indeed , the need to preserve and consolidate it .
It is no secret that the roots of our European identity lie directly in the Christian tradition .
While it is useful for large groups , it is hindering public transport and is responsible for the deterioration of the network and for safety .
On the other hand , the debate on Turkey &apos;s future accession to the EU cannot be abandoned .
This risk must be managed effectively and , as we know , the tragic events in Japan are recalling , urgently needed .
The main objective of this agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or acuminated objects used in medicine .
In short , even if I conclude the report this evening , I have not yet finished my work , either for me or for the European institutions .
First of all , I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work and I would like to reiterate that my group , right from the outset , has been very cautious to accept the second generation Schengen Information System because of many implications for data protection .
The right conditions must be created .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman received a total of 3 098 complaints compared to 3 406 in 2008 , with a 9 % decrease .
In a ruling issued in October , the European Court of Justice also clearly rejected the obligation to think about reaching the retirement age .
There is also a significant potential for the exploitation of EGNOS and GNSS in the areas of safety , the environment and road traffic , which can be made more lasting as these systems can be used to collect toll collection .
With regard to cohesion policy , which represents nearly a third of the budget , this is the only area in which the estimated error rate is even higher than 5 % .
Of course , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs , whose report received the support of the majority .
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The aim of the proposal for a way out of the crisis to a green economy , namely energy , broadband networks and innovation , is to make large companies rich in profitable sectors , and not to protect the environment and satisfy grassroots requirements .
I therefore share your concern that such important objectives for the Hungarian Presidency risk being distorted by national particularities or debates rather than by factors that unite us .
I agree that it is necessary to make the reimbursement of costs conditional on the issuing of prior authorisation in the precisely described and justified cases , if treatment requires a collection of at least one night or highly specialised and expensive equipment , or when there is a particular risk for patients or the population .
The most effective way to do this would have been - and it is still today - to aim for a more significant target of reducing emissions , to at least 30 % .
Abuse is particularly damaging to those who are making genuine efforts to mitigate environmental damage .
The past visa scandals show , of course , how relaxed some states approach to the issuing of visas is .
The poor population in rural areas , which needs more funding , is once again abandoned .
I know that you have the capacity to face up to these challenges .
Mr President , I would like to offer you a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
Prime Minister Orbán has not presented to our Parliament &apos;s groups as a European political leader who is willing to support and seek a compromise , but as a &apos; fighter &apos; , which has regained the motive of populist nationalism , with the &apos; protection of Hungarian people &apos; from &apos; attacks &apos; .
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I support this report and congratulate Mr Szájer .
We therefore need the help of Russia to persuade Iran not to build nuclear bombs .
I strongly oppose the US idea of preventive bombing and NATO intervention .
However , this is only one of the conditions for stability in Europe .
Mr President , the report by my colleague , Mr Garriga Polledo , is a very important part which enables us to define a new financial framework for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe .
That said , we need to make a commitment to creating conditions so that the fisheries sector becomes truly sustainable and can develop in the long term .
There is no doubt that living conditions in the very beautiful Arctic are prohibitive , but it is also out of the question that , thanks to progress and new technologies , it will be inevitable that this region will become the subject of greater exploitation of its natural resources , of which fishing is an enlightening example .
At the beginning of this year , the unemployment rate among young people reached the 20 % level as a result of the economic crisis , while the school dropout rate reached 17 % , with young people in rural areas who are mostly affected .
Today , there is a huge presence on the labels , images and texts that call the environment and that can cause confusion among consumers : from the images of forests on infants containing dangerous substances to the submission of novel foods in terms of carbon emissions and even ecological cars .
We opposed the proposal because it allegedly gave European countries a responsibility for the dramatic situation of the third underdeveloped world , rather than giving that responsibility to the countries in question .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for using your time and postponing the landscape for lunch even further , but I do so only once every ten years , so I hope that you will not get bad .
This is a delicate task , a task which requires to change things for the best , and its experience is far from insufficient .
We decided to repeal these laws just a year ago : if consumers did not notice great differences , then the same cannot be said to producers , but indeed to be producers .
I believe that the proposals in the package are not ambitious enough , as their only aim is austerity and the reduction of citizens &apos; social rights .
We cannot allow the CAP to have a cut budget , because then it would mean that agriculture is probably less true in Europe .
At the same time , the early closure of such a great structure , which is included in economic calculations , means enormous direct and indirect costs .
That is why I really wish to express the Commission &apos;s satisfaction with the proposed negotiated compromise .
Mr President , Mr Valdis Zatlers , it is with great pleasure that we are all keen to welcome them on your first visit to the European Parliament .
The situation has evolved better later .
When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration can be transmitted , when a readmission agreement is in force - our objective - and when the EU agreements with this third country are consolidated - the global approach and philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration then there is a strengthening of the borders of the Member States of the Union .
We regret that this report did not fully meet our suggestion , but we welcome the fact that it comes to a very close conclusion .
Given that the promotion of a more competitive agricultural system in a more open world trade framework features among the tasks given by Mr Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture , I take this opportunity to ask him how the Commissioner for Agriculture is present with the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in order to conclude the Doha Round .
The report proposes the simplification of monitoring and financial control , as well as the strengthening of technical and scientific evaluation through a fair review based on excellence .
The proposals put forward today in this House should be framed , analysed and included in this regard .
We must also not forget the legal and administrative obstacles ( such as the legal personality , the financing rules and , at times , intellectual property ) , which can discourage the participation of many key operators in research and many small and medium-sized enterprises .
However , I would like to know whether the Commission will reconsider Directive 2007 / 52 on the issues that you have just listed .
This also led me to vote in favour of those provisions that reaffirm corporate social responsibility .
We can see that , with regard to the new development that we set together , which is transparency , the steps have been rather slow , and even with the new rules on access to documents , the possibility for those who make infringement procedures , who are demanding to open up infringement procedures , to know why they are closed or why they are open , is diminishing .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) As my colleague , Mr Tannock , has already said , I would like to reiterate to this House , which unfortunately is unfortunately always empty at this point in time , that this is not the first time that we have addressed the tragic human rights situation in Burma .
The task of society is therefore to ensure that men and women can freely choose between the two logical alternatives , each of which has its justification , if they have a broader perspective than that of work .
Today , it promotes the consumption of products with low nutritional value , jeopardising the survival of thousands of failed farmers who are unable to sell their products to a country which produces 50 % of their needs .
It is not yet possible to predict exactly all the consequences of the current situation for our portfolio and for the performance of our work .
In the context of the peace process in the Middle East , respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is , perhaps , important today as ever ever before , even more important .
Finally , fossil fuels promote centralised , hierarchical and inflexible energy distribution .
I share the views expressed by my fellow Members in this regard .
( HU ) Madam President , the Hungarian Presidency is halfway through its term of office and is therefore the right time to review the successes so far .
I believe that the first railway package analysis must identify the problems of Member States with justified opinions from the Commission , along with a method for resolving them .
Israel is not aware that such an extended military response can only provoke new suicide attacks and new rockets of Kassam missiles on the first occasion .
The government of Burma has chosen to ignore the protests against the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and the appeals for his release from many countries and organisations , including the Secretary-General of the United Nations , the Secretary-General and some ASEAN Member States , which , moreover , Myanmaphygiar belongs .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
The rapporteur , Mr Cutaş , pointed out that the EIB &apos;s activities guarantees in the EU budget amount to almost EUR 20 billion at the end of 2009 , a significant figure for the Union as well , and I therefore believe that Parliament has the right to request explanations of the risks that these bonds entail .
Unfortunately , Finland has already approved this project , but on a personal basis and on behalf of Mr Soini , I would now like to draw up the information on this project , which the citizens of all the Baltic States need before the construction work begins .
If it had not been for the active participation of the Czech Republic , this would never have been a reality .
I believe that conducting an information campaign in this respect is crucial .
Since 1999 , Serbia has been unable to monitor the verification of Kosovo &apos;s identity documents .
Once again , clear and precise rules have been introduced in this area .
Does they want to see the vision proposed by Mr Corbett , with the United States of Europe , or do they want the cheapest , free-trade vision that my party has put forward ?
in writing . - First of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Toia , on the quality of the report that she has presented today .

It is no good hope that some Member States are against the summit on the employment summit on Thursday .
We know that a great deal of work has been done to meet the benchmarks of reference , and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania achieve the criteria as soon as possible .
Under these conditions , tolerating the Moldovan Government &apos;s obligations to finance unreliable European programmes and agencies , such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme or the SESAR programme , when Moldova is not a member of the Union either , I think , a demonstration of cynicism .
This would mean taking two births with one stone , because these infrastructures would boost the European economy and create jobs , while at the same time mitigating the effects of similar crises .
At the EU-Russia Summit held in Khanty-Manyssik , the will of both sides to enter into a strategic agreement laying the foundations for relations between the European Union and Russia for the near future and to help develop the potential of these relations .
Now , there is no doubt that we are still living up to the requirements of the Mediterranean and particularly Libya ; some more thought is needed in acknowledging that perhaps we needed a stronger initiative both to understand what was happening and to put in place concerted action towards the Mediterranean .
Europe &apos;s large funding for this line was conditional on the existence of a shared project by local populations and on the existence of financing with Italian private investment .
( SK ) Madam President , a week ago , reports on the accession process in the countries of the Balkans were published .
We have therefore also abstained from voting on the proposals of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) on the subject of TV1 in Portugal , even though the Portuguese Communist Party is notoriously critical of this situation .
The Committee on Development has proposed a complaint system based on the country , in order to oblige large international business groups to report their revenues according to the country .

I voted in favour of the report on the European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) .
Secondly , with regard to completion , even when Messrs Mladić and Hadžić have been arrested and judged , the work of the ICTY will still not be completed .
I call on the Commission to support calls for compensation for companies responsible for deceived farmers who have inknowingly poisoned their livestock .
in writing . - ( LT ) I supported the European Commission &apos;s initiative to use information and communication technologies to improve the EU &apos;s energy efficiency and to increase the competitiveness of European industry .
In order to find solutions , we need to follow the same approach in the future .
As you know , however , our message focuses mainly on structural reforms : structural reforms are absolutely necessary to increase Europe &apos;s growth potential and Europe &apos;s capacity to create employment .
This partnership can be of great importance , particularly in the light of the global financial crisis that has hit us , and it can offer more possibilities for trade , science and technology , thus enabling us to emerge from the crisis stronger and more stable than before .
We can no longer tolerate action .
The approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon resulted in greater responsibility for the European Parliament , with its administrative burden .
Faced with an unprecedented crisis , which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs , every effort is made to prevent the number of unemployed and poor workers in Europe from reaching 25 million by 2010 .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I have proposed together with four other Members of the European Parliament , and that half the half of the European Parliament has approved , so that the Council and the Commission can commit to genuinely effective legislation on corruption .
Mr President , Presidents of the European institutions , President Buzek , my group fully subscribes to your programme for Parliament and for its management in the next five years .
In the name of democracy , let us keep to those promises !
We think that we can help these countries through this kind of dialogue , especially by strengthening the participation of civil society .
Although I am a socialist , I am convinced that in Sri Lanka &apos;s situation , wars cannot lead to a solution , the Tamil people have the right to defend themselves against military repression .
It is also the right time to give impetus to simpler and cheaper measures for small and medium-sized enterprises , resulting in the creation of more jobs and greater development .
In order to combat this phenomenon , it is very important to adopt uniform security measures within the European Union , including in relation to repackaging .
When discussing collective actions , the American model and its extremists are always mentioned .
The rapid entry into force of the EU-US agreements on extradition and legal assistance would intensify cooperation in criminal matters and would also remove the grey area with which the detainees were transported .
I would like to make three proposals and ask your strong support on this matter .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been several times to pronounce a position , in some specific cases , on whether or not to consider sports like a service that is smoothly beneficial to society or is an integral part of a number of economic aspects that translate its general economic interest into it .
I believe that the protection of EU citizens is absolutely the priority of this institution and that it must be informed of it .
Only time will it tell us whether this is a marginal issue or whether it will prevail in the undeniably positive impacts of the directive .
Modernising the logistics of freight transport and promoting co-modality , for example , by combining various modes of transport in the same transport chain , we have the opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region .
The decision to ratify this ILO Convention should be the responsibility of the Member States as part of a democratic process .

Perhaps the text that will ultimately be adopted will not be so unsatisfactory .
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment in many ways .
We call on the international donors , both government and non-government donors , to cease their activities in some areas in the event of the adoption of the law .
That is something that must necessarily be reinstated .
( DE ) Mr President , thank you very much .
Today , Václav Havel told us that Europe is the homeland of our homelands .
In Slovakia , therefore , if I address a policeman in Hungarian , they will be obliged to respond to me in the Slovak language , even though his mother tongue is Hungarian and regardless of the fact that I cannot understand his answer .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to pick up on one aspect of transatlantic cooperation on judicial and police matters relating to SWIFT , which has already been mentioned , namely the transfer of SWIFT bank data to the United States .
In 2009 , we witnessed a worrying recovery in the various forms of protection put in place by individual EU Member States and new emerging economies .
In the case of the SWIFT agreement , transparency has not been considered serious - either by the Commission or by the Council .
Lastly , from a political point of view , it is important for us to establish an alliance with the ACP countries within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
We therefore need to do something differently .
If we can meet a abandoned orphan and a family who so much wants of children , we will have made a very important contribution .
In order to take an important step towards success in the 2020 strategy , it is vital that the various EU institutions cease to compete with each other , but instead we must cooperate honestly to prepare instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the 2020 strategy .
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Chile and the EU &apos;s humanitarian aid strategy .
The terrible events in Gaza should also prompt us to look at this situation from a more strategic and long-term perspective .

Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , the Europol package consists of four projects aimed at implementing the Council Decision of 6 April 2009 .
Madam President , tomorrow &apos;s vote will be largely an expression of the position of the European Parliament .
In a turbulent global context and at a time of economic and financial crisis , the European Union is being called upon to strengthen its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values , to pursue its interests and to protect its citizens through the development of a shared vision of major challenges and threats , and to bring its capabilities closer to meet them properly , thus contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security .
This is a good moment in relations between the two parties and the results of the current global agreement are good .
The common register will be a step forward for greater transparency within the European institutions , which , in turn , should help legitimise the European project in the face of citizens .
I suggest that you consult the Rules of Procedure .
I therefore call for a proactive approach .
the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1466 / 97 on strengthening the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300 / 2010 - ,
However , if we really want to be successful in this area , we must support this action with decisive and decisive policy measures .
Mrs Ronzulli , I will repeat this again for the last time .
I would like to see a specific timeframe or specific benchmarks set in this regard , regardless of how the Commission intends to structure them , and perhaps the Commission could also reflect on what proposals it intends to bring to the table of the negotiations in order to meet India &apos;s requirements in some way .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning , I have heard a genuine statement against the Italian President of the Council that , thanks to his entrepreneurial activities , he really does work on tens of thousands of people .
If it is appropriate or not , it is a matter for Parliament itself .
The report therefore wishes to highlight the importance of an unknown programme and , at the same time , calls for changes : modifying administrative and financial rules , too burdensome , and the low success rate of the programme , which are still prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises , despite the fact that they play an important role in the process of transforming the results of research into products and services , as well as in improving cooperation and coordination between the various national sources of research , and the various sources of funding , for a time .
The point is that the European Central Bank is not independent in the Greek crisis : it has sidelined itself .
It does not mean that our businesses should lose their competitiveness .
He called for the total prohibition of so-called naks and body scanners .
According to statistics , cardiovascular diseases each year cause the deaths of 4.3 million European citizens , while cancer affects over 1.7 million victims .
Vaccines are the most economical and effective public health measure to protect Europe against infectious diseases , but it is also important that healthcare reaches developing countries in order to help improve life expectancy and combat poverty .
We must therefore state loud and clear that the exploitation of banks of the new rules introduced within the euro area to increase their profits to the detriment of our citizens is obvious .
In this economic situation , and especially in the European Parliament , we must ensure that we monitor expenditure .
I therefore believe that greater protection of industrial property rights , including patents , is essential for European competitiveness .
Muhannad Al Hassani had a very important role to play in all proceedings brought to the Supreme Court of State Security and in drawing up reporting on the conditions of detainees in Syria .
We need a European strategy to combat natural disasters and greater interoperability and coordination between the various EU instruments .

It was not only a financial credit that was plundered , but also a social credit .
These new measures would help European companies and citizens to assert their rights , especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications , social benefits and residence bonds .
The issue of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not a unique case .
In its conclusions , the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment with the objective of preparing , if necessary , a EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010 .
One fact : men have the right to be fully involved in the first days after a child reaches a family child .
These intentions deserve our appreciation rather than our criticism , although this is not the main point of today &apos;s debate .
The reality is that the European Union must break the link of absolute dependence on Russian energy supplies .
( RO ) Madam President , Canada is currently the European Union &apos;s 11th largest trading partner and trade relations between the European Union and Canada represented 1.6 % of the total trade trade with EU foreign trade .
Firstly , I would like to stress that the rapporteur who introduced this issue into our Rules of Procedure was Mrs Renault , not I .
The country &apos;s fishing sector is still completely underdeveloped .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today &apos;s debate provides for the examination of four reports , so I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work , and the European Commission for their cooperation .
As far as the summit is concerned , I agree that this is an important opportunity .
This regulation will clarify the rules on cabotage that will be applicable - and I say this in particular to Mr Grosch - in a uniform and non-bureaucratic way across the European Union , without any repercussions for the cooperation that currently exists between Member States under Article 306 of the Treaty .
On the contrary , the Dalai Lama called on the representatives of China to study the documents stored in the government &apos;s archives in exile , so that they can personally see that the violence has not been combated .
It is your response to the situation that has kept development and integration to the global world in mind .
I welcome the efforts made towards clarifying EU law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens .
We often hear demagogic statements that there is no professionalism in the media , and here too , in the European Parliament .
Since human rights are a key aspect of the agreement between the EU and Pakistan , the autonomous trade preferences proposed must be subject to respect for human rights in Pakistan .
I therefore voted in favour of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as it can have a significant impact on the lives of European citizens , given that it directly concerns buildings in which they live and use .
Amendment 9 introduces an unacceptable position on exceptions - albeit transitional - to the principles on which the European Union is founded , including four fundamental freedoms .
However , we are of the opinion that it is totally unacceptable for this House to use these reasons to demand an increase in the budget .
It is finally time to put an end to this unilateral privilege that the United States enjoys .
I would like to say to Commissioner Dalli and the Commission that , now that we have adopted this directive , I would like you to focus more on the social security rules , the system on which everything else is based and which makes it clear who is paid and where everything works .
We must never lose sight of our common goal : to work with the Arctic States and the international community to protect the Arctic and to preserve it for future generations in the best and most effective way possible .
I think it is absolutely necessary and it is a success for Parliament when it comes to budget formation through funds which , as it were , were not used in other areas .
Let us look at the hypothesis .
To do so , we must make every effort to limit the energy intensity of the economy in all its sectors .
In sensitive sectors such as clothing , literacy and arm , creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a priority for companies which have decided to maintain their production in Europe , safeguarding European knowledge and jobs .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of concern for decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has proven to be an effective foreign policy instrument that promotes the consolidation of relations with third countries , with some tangible benefits .
Moreover , this is not just about you .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right , but also the duty to express its opinion .
However , with this draft , we have hit this barrier , and we have done so by thinking about the patient .
The Committee on Budgets recognises the importance of the proposals and their urgency .
I believe that every patient has the right to quality care , provided in his own language , where he or she lives close to his family .
When we speak in this House , we must use the terms that everyone has agreed to and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the candidate country , was accepted as a &apos; Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &apos; and not as a &apos; Macedonia &apos; .
This is a viable undertaking and we can achieve better results .
The recent developments in the European economy , not least in relation to Greece , have demonstrated the urgent and pressing need to strengthen economic governance in Europe .
To be alone , their financier , Stlast Wheeler , said that EU membership costs us GBP 120 billion a year , which is 36 times the actual amount .
Let us hope that this double approach to Belarus , to stick and to carrot , to mention what Mr Tannock said , is what will enable us to achieve the desired outcome .
We could speak for hours on many other issues - energy , non-proliferation , mentioned except - but I think it is vital that we reach a basic agreement between the three reports presented today on the progress made in recent times .
Secondly , you also said that the Commission should start considering the possibility of issuing European bonds , I would say , at last .
Lithuanian Law for the Protection of Children against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information ( debate )
This is not the kind of credibility that Europe needs .
Subject : Importers and SMEs
Under the regulation , tyre production companies will be obliged to use labels that are binding and supplant to provide information to consumers on fuel consumption , on rolling resistance , on bagnation and external rolling noise .
We fully respect each Member State &apos;s right to decide for itself whether or not to ratify the Treaty .
In view of this search for more ambitious and significant results , in the final phase of COP 16 , the European Union should give its main negotiator some scope for manoeuvre so that they can react to the real evolution of the situation during the negotiations .
It is therefore essential to adopt balanced and transparent measures , because securing the confidence of our entrepreneurs is a precondition for the success of this project .
Then there is the problem of the disastrous consequences of massive urbanisation of the environment , particularly in coastal areas and in the Spanish islands , but also in other areas such as that around Madrid .
It is important that the special representative for Central Asia follows this matter very closely , working closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission .
The processes must include the necessary maintenance and surveillance after the closure , treatment , storage and decontamination of waste , environmental improvement of installations and support for the activities to replace the production capacity of closed units , paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency .
I think so .
I come from a country where , when I go to the supermarket , I always have a few invoices in select of a motorine with a bill of wood on bees .
For example , there has been a thorough debate on the issue of the purchase of fertile land in developing countries and those that have not been seminated , and the purchase of land in itself is a very interesting topic and I think that we can achieve some common understanding on this .
However , without a European network , the fundamental objectives of the European Union will not be met .
tobacco is cultivated in 17 of the 27 Member States , with government funding .
One of the three , English , French or German , will be used to automatically ensure legal protection throughout the European Union .
For Ireland , this is a controversial topic and it is playing into the hands of those who oppose the Lisbon Treaty .
The Presidency has done everything in its power to reach an agreement , but has subsequently decided to leave the decision to the European Council .
Even if Canada is one of our oldest trading partners , we cannot deny that opinions often differ .
That is the way the Commission intends to proceed .
Some of these problems could , however , have been isolated cases linked to the transcending of the agency in the definitive departments .
The proposed amendments will also allow Member States that are less developed , such as Romania , to meet the requirements for accessing the fund .
The next item is the vote .
Mr President , I have to say that it is very encouraging to hear so many Members from all the groups in this House praising the Belgian Presidency , and rightly so .
I do not need to stress the importance of both of these things in the current situation .
Together , we will endeavour to conclude the Doha Round with a positive budget in 2010 , because it is extremely important for the efforts to promote recovery and to combat protectionism .
Today , ladies and gentlemen , it is a special day for me because , after ten years of good and honest servants , this is my last session as President here in Brussels .
From the point of view of effectiveness , I also find the proposal that these delegations be granted some consular functions , such as the issuing of Schengen visas , to be interesting .
It seems that we have spent more time discussing with each other on a daily basis than with others and we have been deeply defeated .
In my opinion , the draft Commission has to be improved and Parliament should therefore have more time to make a decision .
Perhaps there is a intention to go further than there is now on the table .
All Member States would have been in a much harder situation without the protective shield of the European Union .
As a Social Democrat , I welcome the fact that India has made significant progress in terms of universal primary education , reducing poverty and improving access to safe drinking water .
This morning , Mr Barroso , the Treaty of Lisbon , said that it is up to the Commission to speak on behalf of the European Union on environmental issues .
We can even express opinions , we can even disagree , even if the Eurosceptics are allowed to , but the final result must be the same .
Lukashenko , who is another political player , has managed to use the programme for his campaign , has served all political and economic benefits and , at the same time , has continued to talk with contempt for democracy and human rights .
In turn , in the same statement , the European Union and Russia wanted to see the negotiation and conclusion of local border traffic agreements between Russia and the EU Member States which are neighbours of this matter negotiated and concluded .
This is crucial for the future of European citizens .
Commissioner , you yourself mentioned the shortcomings that are still to be overcome in the legislation of some Member States .
We must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the population of the southern part of Israel has the right to live without bombing .
We must do everything we can to ensure that the environment and health are not only properly recycling , but also to reduce the loss of raw materials .
I would point out that there is still a system of international cautious custody on Omar al-Bashir , a matter which the authorities of the country ignore .
The letter also confirmed the Commission &apos;s intention to send Parliament a thorough report on the first year on the operation of the project and the preparatory work has begun in this respect .
Mr President , I would have expected a point of order from you .
As far as the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market is concerned , the proposal is essentially valid , since it provides for a ban and the gradual replacement of products with serious and harmful effects on human health .
The purpose of the draft decision is to define the fishing opportunities of EU ships on the basis of overfishing stocks available , as well as the financial contribution that has been made separately for access rights and sectoral support .
The European Union must give the new Tunisian Government all possible assistance and be close to the people of Tunisia , including the people who were stranded at the moment in their holidays in Tunisia .
I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because I believe that it is right and proper that Taiwan should be placed on the positive list .
Unfortunately , even in democratic societies , traditional media are often sent either because of commercial interests or because their direction belongs to a specific political circle that indirectly forces employees to self-governing .
Within the European Union , we cannot live with such a situation , so we believe that it is vital that the Commission , the authorities of the European Union , and we all come forward with convergence and aimed at bringing this situation to an end .
This is one thing , and I intend , on the other hand , to take into account a whole series of social , environmental and economic criteria , because I committed myself to making all laws in advance .
That is why I voted in favour of the report on the Seventh , Eighth , Ninth and Tenth European Development Fund for the financial year 2008 .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner Georgieva , it is good to deal with the situation of Belarus here in the European Parliament , but this is not enough .
Mr President , I would like to express and justify my support for this proposal .
I am pleased to note that East Jerusalem is considered as the capital of the future Palestinian state , or rather , Jerusalem of the two states .
The third conclusion we can draw is that the European Union must be ready .
However , there are also substantial differences between regions of a Member State .
Prevention and elimination of violence against women are fundamental strategic objectives , which are closely linked to the aspiration for progress that our civilisation pursues .
I look forward to your answers .
The preliminary results of the referendum in 10 Member States were announced on 30 January and showed that the vast majority of the population ( 9.5 % ) is in favour of secession .
I am of the opinion that Europe needs a common energy policy that aims to avoid over-dependence on the resources of a single area .
The FVO also found serious shortcomings in the traceability system used by Brazil and found problems with many shipments to transit to the European Union , which did not have the necessary certificates .
Now the committees will be able to take the floor .
I therefore believe that the most important issue now is what we could build on as a result of the results of the Swedish Presidency and how .
In the wake of the crisis , the role of the European Union must be strengthened .
Hence , the importance of a mutual dialogue , which will listen to the views expressed and respect them .
I call on the Lithuanian authorities to restore the names of Poles of the streets and cities in regions where the majority of residents belong to the Polish minority .
As all these actions are interlinked , indispensable and consistent with the extent of the ambition that we have expressed in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we must achieve this ambitious outcome as soon as possible , in line with the expectations of the citizens .
( DE ) Madam President , I voted in favour of this report as it represents significant progress in the current situation .
That is why I voted in favour .
The aim of this text is to increase risk tolerance by simplifying bureaucratic control mechanisms and creating greater confidence in the scientific and economic community .
Mr President , I would like to endorse what Mr Daul said .
The resolution adopted today emphasises that the establishment of a common register ensures the widest possible participation of the various categories of operators , while respecting their differences and their specific characteristics .
As a representative of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would like to ask the President of the Commission who , over the last few weeks , has been very committed to the situation taken from the images from the Mediterranean : many people who have fleed Africa have managed to reach Europe , while others have failed to do so .
However , none of this has happened , as is unfortunately the case with the situation that arose in Lampedusa .
Israel is bombing and deceiving a ghetto .
It is important to listen to the views of others , but it is also important to learn from past experience .
in writing . - The issue of global food security and CAP relations is very important .
I would therefore like to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
We need a partnership based on mutual respect , for our common commitments , and also for the values that the European Union defends when it comes to human rights , democracy and the principle of the rule of law .
It accounts for 3 % of EU GDP and generates a trade surplus of EUR 35 billion .
In this respect , we tabled , as a liberal democrat for Europe , an amendment calling for - not just for Europe , of course , we are also addressing the United States , as the Commissioner knows well - that a total abolition of export subsidies is quickly being carried out .
Almost all the participants insist on the need to direct or focus the CAP on the issues of the competitiveness of European agriculture , the capacity for reaction to climate change , food security and quality requirements , and finally to other environmental objectives .
We also believe that the negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit in May .
The next item is the joint debate on :
It is of the utmost importance , of course , that specific EU subsidies for small cities be increased , as this is where the greatest potential lies for the economy and finance lies , given that these individuals have been particularly hard hit by the crisis .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Court of Auditors &apos; report will not be officially submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control until next week .
In order to achieve a reduction of 25-40 % in greenhouse gases , as scientists recommend , and to halt the decline in biodiversity , significant financial resources are needed to halt the decline in biodiversity .
This carrot and stick are the key dynamics of the accession process that can enable the governments of these countries to focus on work and reforms which , once and for all , can consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans .
I will focus on two reports , given their importance .
The defendants must enjoy the same rights throughout Europe and receive mandatory information in this respect , in the interests of legal certainty for all the players involved .
Foreign Affairs and diplomacy fall under national sovereignty , which is why we voted against all of the reports in this respect .
I refer to Article d , Mr Weber .
I also welcome the positive assessment of the proposal for continued efforts made by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to stabilise the region .
I hope that what happened in Greece a few hours ago will not be easy , but that today &apos;s day will be the beginning of a unanimous effort to create a European identity through solidarity and partnership .
We have kept contacts with the Tunisian people , with the Egyptian people , with our delegations , and I pay tribute to the situation that they have been facing in the last two weeks , and we have also been in direct contact with the government and with the services .
I am convinced that this financial instrument is even more relevant in the light of the financial crisis , as it can support companies for a more effective recovery and will be able to form a pilot project for the establishment of a broader energy fund .
Those inspections were inadequate .
Then we will be able to make a major contribution from Europe , but it cannot be a poorly spent pot .
I voted in favour of the special report by the European Ombudsman to Parliament , following his draft recommendation to the European Commission on complaint 676 / 2008 / RT on excessive delays in providing a response to the Ombudsman &apos;s services .
Compared to the existing legislation , the greatest progress of this directive is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and have access to information about the quality and safety of the treatment they will receive .
I reiterate the need to call on the European Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund flexibly , as well as to review regional programmes funded by the Cohesion Fund in order to adapt them to the requirements arising from the tragedy .
Having heard the consumer rights associations and entrepreneurs &apos; representatives , I realise that we need to pursue even greater harmonisation of consumer rights throughout the European Union .
It seems that here , those who ask questions are in the bad situation .
Parliament therefore has the power and the duty to monitor the negotiations - in this case trade - and to intervene politically using the parliamentary instruments that it has , such as the hearings , resolutions and oral questions , so as to keep itself informed about the progress of the negotiations .
There is no recognition of citizens &apos; investment in social cohesion or solidarity between generations .
However , the real reform lies in admissibility .
I agree that this issue is one of the most serious in the European Union today with regard to human rights .
Adequate financial resources must be made available to enable the European Union to seize existing opportunities and to exploit new sources of global competitiveness .
It is well known that in many European countries , public authorities , in situations of difficulties , are usually paid too late , resulting in the failure of some companies very often .
The G20 conference also identified the dismantling of tax havens as a priority objective .
However , there is no response from the political class .
Of course , the dollar continues to dominate global transactions and still offers the prospect of a secure investment , but the massive debt accumulated by the United States so that the rest of the world can finance their standard of living is gradually raising doubts about the ability of the world &apos;s leading economic power to meet its commitments .
We must ensure that a free society has adequate instruments and measures to combat and defeat those who would like to destroy it .
To be practical , Iceland , when it was a rich country , had no interest in joining the European Union .
This is not the first time that such a request has been made , Mr Vice-President .
This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and involving everyone in order to ensure a high level of local acceptance .
However , it is a problem that will expel the fight against international terrorism in countries and regions neighbouring until the fighting in Afghanistan continues .
We must combat fragmentation and , therefore , I call on Commissioner Andor to maintain a single regulation of the European Social Fund and not to divide it as sometimes suggested in this House .
Of course , it is in the nature of the situation that we cannot achieve everything that we want in a compromise .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lamassoure , and the three rapporteurs , Mr Surján , Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug , for demonstrating a constructive attitude during the budget procedure , which shows the excellent cooperation that emerged during the proceedings .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( LT ) Mr President , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to the recent murder of human rights activists in Russia .
It would have been better to say that we should not take a granted for granted that the negotiations should be completed by opening up the way for more realistic alternatives , such as a preferential partnership .
It is therefore , above all , an American problem that needs to be resolved by Washington .
I would also add that we should implement a reform that makes EU universities more independent and European , open to students and researchers , as well as creating dynamic development in the knowledge society .
Their share , once sold , can be kept in the national reserve and distributed later on , at the discretion of the Member State .
Therefore , I appeal once again to you , on 25 May , to mark International Day for the Heroes of Totalitarianism , so that many people in this House who , just like Pilecki , lost their lives in the fight for fundamental rights and freedoms , deserve to be remembered .
Let me just briefly talk about what we do .
If this were to become the prevailing opinion in the European Union during the next parliamentary term , the peace plan that is widely funded and set up at the end of the Balkan war would be undermined .
I hope that this will encourage participation in EMAS , not because I want to enter into a comparison between EMAS and ISO , but because I believe that the system is valid and could help us meet our sustainability criteria .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As several speakers have said , tomorrow &apos;s vote is very important , and I think it will do well .
Payary dumping and the social consequences of this can no longer be admitted .
This is very important for an effective neighbourhood policy .
By preventing best practice based on the experience of the Member States , and by complying with fundamental standards such as non-discrimination , fair and fair treatment and protection against direct and indirect expropriations , we can have the basis for a consistent European policy on this matter .
I am well aware that , during the public consultation on the Green Paper on the quality of agricultural products , the persons affected in the sheep meat sector declared themselves in favour of mandatory origin labelling .
I am fully aware of the complexity of this subject , Mr Kelly .
Despite many nations facing many economic and financial problems , particular attention must be paid to the interruption of the negative effects of climate change .
I ask for your support .
At the same time , we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debates on the reform of the own resources system .
In practice , this type of action has been extended .
Mr President , the Commission , like the European Parliament , has the right to express its opinion on the audit process .
Fraud rates in France and Spain , for example , are regarded as &apos; curiously low &apos; .
In 2005 , the Council suspended the 2003 measures .
They are interested in solutions ; they worry that their money is still safe .
It is therefore important to activate a network of statistical data sharing and a platform for coordinating research activities on the causes , prevention and treatment of Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I share the view expressed by many of my fellow Members today that the greater European solidarity , the better relations between the EU and Russia , will be .
Syria has a long way to go with regard to freedom of speech and association .
There is still a great deal to be done to ensure that women have access to work .
I repeat , however , that the proposal must be reviewed in order to take into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The following amendments have been proposed :
We are fully aware that the situation of dairy farmers is unsustainable .
I supported this report because I wanted to highlight a particular threat to it which it refers : the lack of reliable and comprehensive information for consumers on the health , composition and origin of certain species of fish .
After all , history is full of examples of intervention by Western countries which have proven to be more damaging than useful .
As rapporteur , I believe that this proposal is completely inefficient and is not in a position to tackle crime prevention for various reasons .
This Palestinian agreement is a first political event and , contrary to what has just been said in this House , Hamas has , for the first time , accepted the Organisation for Freedom of Palestine and the Palestinian Authority as negotiating partners .
Countries are arguing and negotiating a possible breakdown of sea foundations .
The EU &apos;s energy infrastructure , which ...
In other words , under charge , it is precisely the institution created to protect ourselves against criminals ( indirect , by giving professional training to police officers ) .
However , the transfer of power between Fidi Castro and the brother Raúl did not lead either to democratic reforms or to the release of political prisoners .
The Energy Efficiency Group will also include in all advertisements information about energy consumption or about the price of products .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are all aware of the Washington Consensus : you have admitted it !
In this way , we could also provide an appropriate response to the real situation on the ground , which Frontex already addresses in any case .
To conclude , I would once again like to thank not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved for their constructive and positive efforts .
We have worked on this with the Czech Presidency and I must welcome its support for our attempts to find progress in this area .
In particular , the commitment of sig Wessberg to the private fabric makes the candidate particularly suitable for the balance between EU law and the real needs of the market and European citizens in particular .
Until now , the conflict has caused 1 000 deaths in 17 days .
This will reduce the number of these products and will make the use of medicines safer .
The Opel case must teach us that it is never too late to launch a coordinated European strategy in the automotive sector .
If we have done so , it was because , like you , President Obama and I do not accept the false option between security and ideals .
The Pact for the euro sadly proposes making wage austerity a permanent element .
A new experiment was recently launched at Manchester airport , and according to a legal opinion , the use of these machinery on children could infringe legislation on the protection and security of children , due to the nature of the image they produce .
In addition , the money does not go directly to artists .
In the area of civil aviation , it is necessary to promote the development of the system and the deployment of EGNOS for landing manoeuvres .
Common rules and standards for bodies performing the inspections and survey of ships and the relevant activities of maritime administrations ( recast ) - Common rules on common rules for ship traffic and information standards for ship inspection and visits ( recast ) - Investments by the port state ( recast ) - Section of Community system for the monitoring of shipping traffic and information - Awareness of maritime liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability liability - ( see accidents ) - in the case of accidents of maritime accidents ) -
I voted in favour of the report on the microfinance facility , which will help those who are at risk of getting to work .
It is important that we have made progress in this respect with the Vlasák report , which I agree with , and I believe that this report will enable us to define better the legal norm of the urban issue , and that we also introduce instruments such as the municipal operational plans as operational plans that can give new quality to cohesion policy .
During the trialogue negotiations , I was aware that the proposals for improvement presented by myself on behalf of the European Parliament are fundamental to having fair and effective energy markets .
In the current economic crisis , moreover , it is absolutely vital that self-employed people be supported and encouraged .
In short , they must not be asked to Brussels .
Mr President , it is now clear to us , to Europe , to the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and to European citizens that energy has become a foreign policy instrument , an element of trade that can lead to conflict or to unite us , and that is precisely what concerns us today .
I voted in favour of the report that the food programme considered to be the extension to be a key instrument for helping the most deprived persons who are suffering greatly in the current economic crisis , including for meeting basic needs .
in writing . - ( LT ) Most industrialised countries , including all EU Member States , have at least an export credit agency which enjoys public support and these agencies as a whole represent the world &apos;s largest official source of financing of projects in the private sector .
For this reason , we are voting against Mrs Wallis &apos;s report .
By making this position , we have helped to destroy the joint government .
In 2003 , with the creation of Conseal Français du Musman &apos;s religion , then the then Minister for the Interior , Mr Sarkozy , is introducing Islam to the French institutions .
In this respect , I have already asked the European Commission to give its opinion and consider the possibility of establishing special programmes to promote equal opportunities for women in science .
We will continue this fight to ensure the protection of citizens &apos; rights and unlimited access of end-users to services .
The large European politicians and thinkers understand very well that the strength to unite Europe was a common approach to economic issues .
The borders between freedom and security do not stop at the borders of the virtual world .
Opening of the sitting
Personally , I hope that , since this summer , the Commission will play a leading role in the coordination of this strategy , specifically in the development of crucial elements such as the promotion of civic education , professional orientation and employment .
The costs will be borne by the country of origin .
I am thinking in particular of what can be done to make the transport system more sustainable .
The decision to enter into dialogue with the Kosovo authorities is also particularly important for the stability of the region .
An accident can therefore be expected for a reactor every 25 years .
I believe that increased eligibility of housing for cofinanced expenses through the European Regional Development Fund should lead us to consider other possible developments , both in the medium and long term , in terms of suitable funding and funding for certain strategic priorities .
Today , it is time to address once again the issue of the violation of religious rights in both these countries , this time against Christians .
I am thinking of climate change , which is one of the most serious threats to our planet .
Of course , a great deal of emphasis has been placed , as I expected , on human rights , the importance of which must be to invest all the European Union &apos;s dynamic relations and to embrace our work .
I must also say that , up to now , the European Union has , to date , completely failed to exercise no competence in the area of air traffic regulation .
Europe , however , is not the way out or the remedy for an economic crisis .
I can therefore confirm to the rapporteur that the Commission has already made a commitment to comitology and eighteen provisions .
I do not believe that any of the solidarity expressed here today , either by the Commission , can change the fact that the European Union has no presence in Libya and is currently unable to stop the crisis in the cities or actions of Gaddafi &apos;s troops .
That is why I firmly believe that the possible approval by the European Parliament of these two regulations will benefit European citizens , who will therefore have a wider range of products including choices .
Mr President , I share the hope that measures will be agreed at the European Council to reassure the markets and restore stability to the euro area because , whether MEPs or not , it should be in everyone &apos;s interest to do so .
Pre-accession funding has proved to be particularly welcome .
That is very good and thank you .
We therefore call for an end to hostilities and violence on all sides , and we call on the European Union to do so .
The world outside Europe is facing the energy challenge very decisively .
The indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in the advertising of the sale or location published in the media .
It is essential to promote efforts aimed at increasing European investment in the diversification of cross-border structures , at providing alternative , non-conventional forms of energy at local level and at improving the infrastructure &apos;s capacity to facilitate the link to new energy sources .
A developed infrastructure is the basis of the efficient functioning of the internal market , which consequently stimulates the growth of internal demand and economic activity .
Secondly , we must consider the creation of a rapid reaction instrument within the ENP in order to be able to respond quickly and flexibly to political changes in partner countries , as recently the case in the southern neighbourhood .
I therefore think it is grotesque that there are advocates here in Parliament of Serbia condemning the EULEX mission .
It follows , therefore , that the only Members who listen are the ones who can follow the speech in an original language .
We have lost a great deal of money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appreciated the Swedish Presidency &apos;s appreciation of the fact that we have highlighted issues that affect our fellow citizens , namely the environment and the climate , the financial crisis , the protection of jobs and the fight against crime , because we need to be in line with those who voted for us to do our work well .
The EU budget cannot , as some MEPs have said , be used in an additional way to national budgets at a time of austerity , but rather it should reflect the difficult situation Member States are in .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Treaty has not given the Council any scope for action on the national constitutions of the Member States .
We are in a special situation .
You can accuse me of cynicism , but I do not think that students can only go to study reasons and that tourists are always leaving for a short period of time .
Is the result of our mistakes , our negligence and our passivity ?
The second &apos; but &apos; is linked to the role that the Belgian Presidency played in the period after Lisbon .
The main objective of these regimes has been , and still remains , to keep the territory of a country that is extremely large , abused by completely different peoples .
( PL ) Although several economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe , we are still discussing its negative consequences .
In the case of Japan , it is a good solution in many areas , but I recognise , for example , the country &apos;s right to protect its own market by protecting producers , by ensuring that they have the highest prices in international courses and by opposing large imports which would destroy farming ; in the same way , I support the right of our economies to protect certain sectors .
( ES ) Mr President , I will refer to two ideas : coordination and flexibility .
For example , only 15 % of elderly people use the Internet .
I am , in fact , determined to work on this new strategy to strengthen the social priority , as I said when we discussed the general lines for the next mandate .
Commissioner , I intend to go straight away and ask you which measures - and I am using intentionally the plural support - the Commission intends to adopt in the short term to address these shortcomings .
That is exactly what has not been lacking so far or which has not been made sufficiently visible in the eyes of the citizens .
It does not concern citizens , and rightly so .
( The sitting was closed at 00.10 )
I hope that Parliament will send out a strong signal , approving with a very large majority Mrs Muscardini &apos;s report , which I thank with the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Gianca Susta .
At the same time , Romania has supported the policy of the open door , which aims , in particular , to strengthen NATO &apos;s relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
I firmly believe that we must do everything possible to avert the consequences of the disaster and restore acceptable living conditions .
I am referring not only to the accidents surrounding work , which take place very frequently , but also to the hazardous substances used in the process of processing .
In September 2009 , the Council started a detailed analysis of the proposed amendment of the decision to set up the European Refugee Fund .
At the moment , it is important to pay particular attention to the island and outermost regions which , in addition to their permanent obstacles , are now emerging from the devastation of infrastructure and goods at a personal , commercial and agricultural level , without being able to resume their normal activities immediately , especially in regions which almost exclusively depend on tourism , because the recurrence of events caused by the media may have a deterrent effect on potential visitors .
It is 11 September 2001 that we did not witness such a prolonged problem for the sector and such heavy financial losses and , despite the current financial difficulties in all Member States , I would urge them to support plans to help a sector that simply cannot afford to suffer any further losses .
At the same time , however , we must admit that we are also increasing our exposure to the risks .
Madam President , I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is terrible .
( ES ) Mr President , allow me to make a brief comment on language and perhaps semantic .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
As long as a given development is concerned , reality must never be forgotten .
Consumer organisations prefer binding measures for a collective redress system in all Member States , combined with other options such as extending the collective actions of the current alternative dispute resolution mechanisms ( ADR ) .
The problem is not Turkish Cypriots , as some have said .
I would like to ask the Commission what it is doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their home countries without them suffering long and difficult journeys to consumers .
That is our task .
Quite honestly , I wonder whether they have ended up being the champions of human rights , happy as we see a secular and pluralistic West , so that we can then wipe out the head in the face of a Middle East which , little by little means , is becoming a brand of a single religion .
We are doing this and we are in dialogue with the authorities in these countries .
Mr President , the bankers who dilute our money are despicable , but , Mr Schulz , the politicians who now accumulate deficits and debts at the expense of the younger generations are also irresponsible .
That is why I must thank the French and Czech Presidency , the committee and the rapporteurs of the individual groups .
We believe that it is now up to the Member States to produce results .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been positive and mutual relations have , in fact , always been always open to cooperation .
We should try to ensure that the programmes provided as much support as possible for the reforms undertaken by these countries in order to move towards the EU .
It is also essential that each Member State establish national contact points to provide patients with all the necessary information about the availability of healthcare , procedures and documentation required .
We lived in the past everything that we saw in the Soviet Union as ideological pressure , but we are now discussing trade under conditions of absolute individual freedom .
Irrespective of the fact that the fund is defined public or private , this report concerns a very specific point : Parliament states , first of all , that it has no legally binding right to finance its deficit , and secondly that there will be no funding of deficits .
They must have been more expensive since the Elena of Trojan , where they greet a thousand ships .
The aid that distorts competition undermines the future of the European automotive industry and will have adverse effects on both employment and technical development .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , in my opinion , there are a few things that we should consider in the next debate .
You have already heard a number of colleagues saying that we want a stronger Stability and Growth Pact with a mechanism that is not the case .
( FR ) Having said that , I think it really is important to remember what is really at stake .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To demonstrate our support for this campaign to stop this ritual barbarbarbaric , I call on you to bury today a red petition as a symbol of our rejection of this practice .
Democratic control is circumvented , as national governments hide behind the Commission and the troika for the most basic measures , while the Commission puts these issues back to national governments .
Investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
As a result of the Commission &apos;s pitiful legal actions in the European Court of Justice , Sweden has begun to allow the use of the 10-year-old decabrienmodification .
It is clear to those of us who come from rural districts , and to those who take part in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that the position that many farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable .
Savers must have transparent information which will make it easy to understand and be accessible .
I think that it could be our job to support the Chinese people in the implementation of this harmonious society .
I supported these two mechanisms with my vote because I am convinced that we must be demanding and ambitious in order to strengthen the stability of budgets in Europe and thus safeguard our future .
It is also important that the initiator of an initiative - a social organisation or a non-governmental organisation - is clearly and explicitly set out in a clear and objective manner , but it must not necessarily come up with a legislative proposal .
There is a city in Latvia , Daugavpils , where more than 90 % of the population is Russian .
I would therefore like to welcome the apologies of Prime Minister Fischer and the recent Czech Government proposal that , by 31 December 2009 , the Ministry of Health will have to take a number of measures to ensure that such violations no longer occur .
I welcomed this report , because gross domestic product ( GDP ) is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by political leaders throughout the world .
The effects of globalisation have now been totally overcome by the economic and financial crisis , and our appropriate reaction is to redesign the criteria for allocating the EGF .
in writing . - ( PT ) This resolution takes note of the declaration of independence of Kosovo of 17 February 2008 , which was recognised by 69 countries , and encourages Member States to strengthen their common approach to Kosovo , with the aim of its accession to the EU .
With regard to the other two institutions , Parliament is number one on the subject of transparency , so in my opinion , it is not a priority , since in terms of the accessibility of documents and the transparency of the sittings and activities of Members , we are more open than any national parliament .
This was an internal political action by the Italian Minister for Reform , Umbert Bosnst .
The warning signals from the Human Rights Observatory in Asturie , my region , and many other organisations , must be seriously considered .
I am voting in favour of the Casini report .
I very much regret the adoption of this resolution , which prohibits the use of thrombin or swine origin .
I have therefore decided to abstain from the vote and I will follow closely the ongoing investigation .
However , the data from the European Commission is not even accurate enough to decide on the measures to be taken to regulate the Member States with the highest indicators of irregularities and fraud .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism .
( The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m. )
More importantly , improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions in non-ETS sectors of 20 % .
Turning to the second question , I can assure my fellow Members that the Commission is well aware that the control of SEPA requires a multidisciplinary approach .
The trialogue yesterday infected a great deal of hope for a final agreement .
Future projections , based on a large annual growth rate of 27 % in the coming years , indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015 .
However , I believe that the legal basis of the proposal must be changed so that the form of a regulation is adopted rather than a decision by the Council .
Many people are asking me what ACTA and I was one of the shadow rapporteurs for the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
I voted in favour of this report as EU financial assistance will help people who have been victims of globalisation to find work and to return to the labour market , and help them to escape from the grip of recession .
As the Internet is the main instrument for improving the conditions for the development and knowledge of citizens from a cultural point of view , especially through the transmission of audiovisual content , I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the European Union will play a leading role in terms of radio spectrum and the creation of software posts for development and innovation .
In addition to the usual concerns about Turkey &apos;s cultural and geographical alterity with regard to Europe and the problems that would arise as a result of the accession of a country directly neighbouring more than 80 million inhabitants , which will continue to support my firm belief in the undesirability of Turkish membership , in a Europe that is , above all , united by the spirit of Christianity .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you .
( Protests in the House )
This means going against the environment and the safety of consumers , because they would be placing old , high-energy and potentially dangerous equipment on the market .
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to following this debate .
I would like to record my thanks to the trade union in Balingen , Dr Reitemann , and the local council for authorising the ceremony of commemoration in honour of the lives of these young men .
Thirdly , I would like to insist with Commissioner Kroes that the Member States be digitised if we want to be proud of this great exemplary project in the future .
Anyone who has experienced and observed the effects of the natural disaster triggered by a technological problem in Bay Mare and the subsequent payment of toxic assets from cyanidation in waterways , which has caused extensive damage to the fauna of the Hungarian Tibza river and the Bulgarian section of the Danube , would do everything possible to prevent a repeat of this disaster in the European Union .
This is a task for everyone : Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
In future , climate change will cost developing countries more than EUR 100 billion annually .
Secondly , there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and to return to their assets : the essential freedom of movement , as you yourself have said , in order to overcome any dividing line .
I therefore agree with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when it rejects the Commission &apos;s proposal .
The important thing is that we found the courage to convene this summit , which we called on to attend the social partners , that we will prepare it with them in the long term , before the labour summit , three workshops have been set out in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague , and that we are trying to draw conclusions that will be of particular help to the Council in June .
At first reading , the European Parliament provided a good basis for the correct application of the rules on cross-border healthcare in the Member States , so that patients , if justified and in accordance with the rules laid down and without overloading the courts , could receive the ambulatial or hospital treatment that they needed in another Member State .

In the resolution that I voted on together with my group , there are some of these things , but I believe that Mr Barroso , the Council , Parliament must be bolder .

Closure of the sitting
